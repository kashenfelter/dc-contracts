                                               OPINION
                                       (Courtlink Filing ID 700223 )

       On January 25, 2002, the Office of Contracting and Procurement ("OCP") issued
an open market IFB No. POHA-2002-B-0047, for Grass Cutting Services for the
Department of Parks and Recreation ("DPR"). (Agency Report “AR” Ex. 1). On
February 11, 2002, 11 bids were opened. (AR Ex. 2). H&B submitted the lowest bid in
the amount of $2,362,565.1 (AR Exs. 2 and 3). Lawn Restoration Services, Inc. ("Lawn
Restoration") submitted the next lowest bid of $4,323,321.2 (AR Exs. 2 and 7).

        On February 27, 2002, the Contracting Officer signed the Determination and
Findings for Unreasonable Bid Price ("H&B D&F"). (AR Ex. 4). In the H&B D&F, the
Contracting Officer considered: 1) the original estimate of the Program Office, 2) the
current price paid for the service, 3) the government estimate per acre, 4) the DOL wage
rates, and 5) the number of man-hours needed for the work. (AR Ex. 4). Although, after
bid opening, the contracting officer discussed other matters with protester’s personnel,
the District concedes that the contracting officer did not request verification of H&B’s
low bid or any justification of its amount. Nevertheless, the Contracting Officer
determined that H&B’s bid price was unreasonably low. Accordingly, H&B was
determined to be nonresponsible.



1
  Bids were evaluated for the total price of the base year and 4 option years. The H&B base year price was
$516,595 for an average $30 per acre.
2
    The Lawn Restoration base year price was $ 752,939 for an average $45 per acre.

        On February 26, 2002,3 the Contracting Officer determined Lawn Restoration to
be responsible. (AR Ex. 6 “Lawn Restoration D&F”). Subsequent to the contracting
officer executing the two D&Fs, a successor contracting officer was appointed. On
March 6, 2002, the Successor Contracting Officer awarded the contract to Lawn
Restoration. (AR Ex. 7). Prior to award, the Successor Contracting Officer, who had not
made the H&B nonresponsibility determination, discussed the H&B bid with an OCP
cost analyst. The analyst considered the H&B price to be unrealistically low. The
Successor Contracting Officer did not consider H&B’s low bid to have been a mistake by
H&B, but rather believed that H&B was “buying in,” that is submitting an unreasonably
low price with the expectation of recouping its losses through equitable adjustments. See
FAR §3.501, The Successor Contracting Office did not request any further information
from H&B. (AR Ex. 5 and AR Ex. 9).

        On March 22, 2002, H&B filed the present protest contending that the District
violated § 22044 of the Procurement Regulations, Obtaining Information for
Determination of Responsibility, by failing to request H&B to justify its low bid.5 In the
absence of any request for verification or justification of the low bid, we find the
Determination and Findings for Low Bid Price to be premature and sustain the protest.

        Relying on § 2200.5 of the D.C. Procurement Regulations, 27 DCPR § 2200.5,
the District asserts that the contracting officer may determine a bidder nonresponsible if
its bid price is unreasonably low or unrealistic, without any discussion with the
apparently low bidder.6 We disagree with this position. Although the referenced section
does not itself include a direction that the contracting officer must permit the offeror to
verify and explain its bid, the section specifically states that “the contracting officer may

Executed before the finding of nonresponsibility of the low bidder.

  Protester also alleged a violation of § 2202.6 which requires reference of responsibility determinations of
certified disadvantaged businesses to the Minority Business Opportunity Commission. The “grass cutting
services” which are sought are categorized pursuant to National Institute of Government Purchase (NIGP)
as Code 98836 “Grounds Maintenance: Mowing, Edging, Plant (Not Tree) Trimming, etc.” Although
H&B is certified within NIGP Code 98852 “Landscaping (Including Design, Fertilizing, Planting, etc., But
Not Grounds Maintenance or Tree Trimming Services,” it is not certified in NIGP Code 98836 which
includes mowing. Thus H&B is not certified within the business category covering the contract services
sought by this procurement and consequently lacks standing to raise issues regarding disadvantaged
business status. See, M&G Services, Inc., CAB No. P-0652, May 10, 2002, 13 P.D. 8239 (Courtlink Filing
ID 683921). Since the subject procurement is not a “set-aside,” procurement, but rather an “open market”
procurement, lack of certification does not effect H&B’s eligibility for award.

  On April 4, 2002, the District notified the Board and the protester that OCP had issued the Determination
to Proceed with Contract Performance while a Protest was Pending. Opposition to proceeding with the
contract was not timely filed. Order, April 18, 2002 (Courtlink Filing ID 640124).

    Section 2200.5 states:

          If the contracting officer determines that the price bid or offered by a prospective contractor is so
          low as to appear unreasonable or unrealistic, the contracting officer may determine the prospective
          contractor to be nonresponsible.
                                                   3           Horton & Barber Prof. Serv, Inc., CAB No. P-0653



determine the prospective contractor to be nonresponsible [emphasis supplied]” based on
the unreasonably low bid.

       In order to determine the bidder to be nonresponsible, the contracting officer must
follow the instructions of § 2204 of the Procurement Regulations entitled “Obtaining
Information for Determination of Responsibility.” Subsection 2204.2 requires that “[t]he
contracting officer shall obtain information regarding the responsibility of a prospective
contractor who is the apparent low bidder [emphasis supplied]” and the immediately
following subsection, 2204.4, requires that “[t]he prospective contractor shall promptly
supply information requested by the contracting officer regarding the responsibility of the
prospective contractor.”

       A bid believed to be unreasonably low may reasonably give rise to suspicion that
the bidder has made a mistake in its bid. See e.g., Foley Company, B-241678, Feb. 8,
1995. In such event, a contracting officer is required to seek verification from the bidder.
Section 1536.2 of the Procurement Regulations provides:

       In cases of apparent mistakes and in cases where the contracting officer has reason to believe that
       a mistake may have been made, the contracting office shall request from the bidder a verification
       of the bid and call attention to the suspected mistake. [emphasis supplied]


        The Successor Contracting Officer’s assertion that he did not believe that a
mistake had been made, but rather that H&B had intentionally submitted an unreasonably
low bid for the purpose of buying-in is neither persuasive nor reasonable. The
Comptroller General has consistently held that buying-in, even if the bid is below cost, is
not grounds for refusing to award a contract to the low bidder. DOD Contracts, Inc, B-
227689.2, Dec. 15, 1987, 87-2 CPD ¶ 591; Salz Lock and Safe, B-227547, July 6, 1987,
87-2 CPD ¶ 18; American Maid Maintenance, B-225571, Jan. 9, 1987, 87-1 CPD. ¶ 47.
If buying-in were suspected, the District, after award, must insure that the contractor will
live up to its obligations.

        Without having requested a verification or explanation of the price from H&B,
neither the Contracting Officer, nor the Successor Contracting Officer, had a reasonable
basis to conclude that what they considered an unreasonably low bid was an attempt to
buy in and not a mistake. “At a minimum, the information should have suggested to the
contracting officer to conduct a more careful review of [the allegedly unreasonably low
bid], including, for example, a request for information concerning the [low bidder’s]
estimates of manhours and costs. C.P.F. Corp., CAB No. P-0413, Nov. 18, 1994, 42
D.C. Reg. 4902.

        Since H&B was never given an opportunity to explain its bid, we find that the
rejection of its bid was premature. See Contract Services Co., Inc., 66 Comp. Gen 468
(1987), 87 CPD ¶ 521. H&B has verified that its bid was intended and not mistaken by
filing of this protest. H&B has also provided a logical explanation of why it believes that
                                            4          Horton & Barber Prof. Serv, Inc., CAB No. P-0653



it can perform the contract at a lower price, that it is the only bidder which garages its
vehicles in the District and thus is closer to the job site, reducing travel time for the
vehicles and personnel. We therefore sustain the protest.
        The fact that we have found that the original determination to reject H&B’s bid
was premature is not a finding that H&B is responsible. That determination must be
affirmatively made by the contracting officer. We therefore direct the Successor
Contracting Officer reconsider H&B’s responsibility, including raising his concerns
about the price with H&B, and issue a further Determination and Finding of H&B’s
responsibility. In reconsidering the H&B’s responsibility, the Successor Contracting
Officer shall give great weight to the responses he receives from H&B. See Bulloch
International, GSBCA No. 10168-P, Sept. 22, 1989, 90-1 BCA ¶ 22,296. If the
Successor Contracting Officer determines that H&B is not responsible based on a finding
that the bid price is unrealistically low, he shall make explicit reference in the D&F to
each of H&B’s positions in support of its bid, as well as specific findings and conclusions
with respect to each. See Kopff v. District of Columbia Alcoholic Beverage Control Bd.,
381 A.2d 1372, 1384 (D.C. 1977)

        If the successor contracting officer determines H&B to be responsible, the
contract with Lawn Restoration shall be terminated and a contract for the remainder of
the base year, together with the District’s options for future years shall be awarded to
H&B to commence performance no later than June 17, 2002. The successor contracting
officer shall file his determination and finding with the Board no later than May 31, 2002.

      As with any determination by a contracting officer, a finding of nonresponsibility
may be protested to this Board.
