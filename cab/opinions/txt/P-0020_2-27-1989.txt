                 GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
                         CONTRACT APPEALS BOARD


PROTEST OF:
       SMITH & WESSON
       Under IFB No. 6279-AA-10-0-6-EJ

    For the Protester:    Dennis B.   Lee,               Director, Federal
Marketing.   For the Government: Philip T.               VanZile, Assistant
Corporation Counsel, D.C.
     Opinion by Administrative Judge Sharpe 1 with Administrative
Judges Booker and Davis concurring.

                                  OPINION
       There is pending before us the District's motion to dismiss
this protest 2 as being time barred under the provisions of the
D.C.    Procurement Practices Act of 1985       (PPA) , D.C. Code, sec.      1-
1189.8(b) (1987)    and   our protest    regulations     (sec.   300.4).    See
"Motion of Appellee District of Columbia to Dismiss the Bid Protest
or,    in the Alternative,   for Extension of Time in Which to File An
Agency    Report"   (filed   September    26,   1986).      The    motion   was
accompanied by a memorandum of points and authorities (District's
Memorandum) .    The protester, smith & Wesson (S&W) , did not file a
response to the motion.


     1Judge Sharpe's participation in this case is pursuant to the
authority contained in the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985,
D.C. Code, sec. 1-1189.2(c) (2) (1987).
      2This case originated during the period when the District of
Columbia Contract Appeals Board was functioning pursuant to
commissioner's Order No.9, D.C. Code, Supplement V (1978), as
amended by Mayor's Order 86-65, 33 OCR 3006 (May 16, 1986).
Pursuant to the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985 (PPA), D.C.
Code, sec. 1-1189.1 (1987), a new independent agency denominated as
the Contract Appeals Board was created.      This new Board became
operational on August 1, 1988, and succeeded to the jurisdiction of
al l cases pending before the previously established Board.
                                               -    2 -

        We proceed to set out the facts relevant to the District's
motion.      On February 27,            1986,        the Department of Administrative
services       (DAS) ,      on    behalf       of         the       D.C.    Metropolitan            Police
Department,     issued Invitation for Bids No. 6279-AA-10-0-6-EJ (IFB)
for the procurement of 9rom semi-automatic pistols and magazines for

the pistols.          See District's Memorandum,                      exh. A.         By its letter
dated March 21,           1986, to DAS,            S&W requested clarification of two
requirements        included      in    the        IFB       and    claimed,     in       effect,     that
certain      other        specifications                 were        unduly      restrictive            of
c ompetition        and    in    one    case        also        amounted       to     a     sole-source
procurement.          The       March   21         letter          closed   with      the     following
solicitation:
               in the interest of competitiveness in procurement
        and to ensure that the Government be guaranteed safe and
        reliable equipment at the best available price, it is
        strongly requested that a       re-issuance of these
        specifications and an appropriate extension of the bid
        opening date be accommodated.
        In a follow-up letter dated April, 4, 1986, S&W asked DAS for
a response to its March 21 letter.                            On June 6, 1986, DAS responded
seriatim to the March 21 letter in the form of a written amendment
(Addendum NO.4)           to the IFB.              See District's Memorandum, exh.                      C.
Addendum No.        4 contained,        among other things,                    clarifications and
the reasoning behind the specifications S&W questioned.                                          In the
final     analysis,         Addendum         No.         4    did     not   change         any   of    the
questioned specifications other than by clarification.
        Being of the view that Addendum No. 4 did not modify the IFB
as requested in its March 21 letter, S&W, by letter dated June 26,
1986, submitted a protest to DAS.                            The protest was directed to Ms.
Gwendolyn      B.     Lewis,      Acting       Administrator,               Materiel        Management
                                               -    3 -

Administration. 3          DAS forwarded the protest to the Board, and we
received it on July 10,                1986.        Five days later         (July 15,     1986),

S&W filed a protest with the Board setting forth grounds identical
to those that were included in the protest it submitted to DAS.4

      Any analysis         of    a   question            concerning the timeliness of a
protest   must     begin        with    a   recognition           that    the   PPA     (sec.    1-
1189.8 (b))   requires a protest to be filed with the Board within
ten working days after the protester knew or should have known of

the grounds on which the protest is based.                              We have consistently

construed     this     section         to      mean       that    this    Board    is    without

jurisdiction to hear and decide on the merits,                              a   protest which

does not meet the statutory ten-working days filing requirement.
See    Hood's      Institutional            Foods         (D.C.   CAB    January   25,    1989),
citing, MTI Construction Company. Inc., 1 P.O. 66, 70-71 (D.C. CAB
June 1, 1987) and Southern International Corporation, 1 P.O. 30, 31

(D.C. CAB February 27, 1987).                  The District argues that S&W's March

21 letter evidences that it was aware of its protest grounds as of
the   date    of     the    letter.                See    District's      Memorandum      at     3.
Alternatively, the District argues that because Addendum No.4 made
a definite response to the March 21 letter, S&W knew or should have
known of its grounds of protest on or about June 10,                                  1986      (the
signature date shown on S&W's acknowledgment of Addendum No.4).

     3I t appears from the date stamped on the protest letter that
the protest was received by Ms. Lewis' office on June 30, 1986.
     4We note that the Board's letter of September 4, 1986, to                                  S&W
acknowledging receipt of the protest incorrectly stated that                                    the
Board received the protest on July 18, 1986.   In this regard,                                  see
the Board's docket sheet for this case and the date stamp on                                    the
back of the protest letter.

Id.; see also S&W's signed copy of Addendum No.4 attached to the
protest.     If we agree with either of the District's arguments, we
must dismiss the protest because each of the occasions the District
refers to occurred more than ten working days before the July 15,
1986 filing date of the protest.                  July 15, 1986, is the operative
protest filing date because the protest which was directed to DAS
and later transmitted by it to the Board is not properly before us.
section 1-1189.3(1)           provides that protests must be "addressed to
the Board" not to the procuring agency in order for the Board to
have jurisdiction to review and decide them.                   It therefore follows
that a protest which has not been addressed to the Board, though
received by it,          has not been filed with the Board.
Construction Company. Inc., supra, at 68.
     The critical fact underlying the District's two arguments is
S&W's March 21 letter.            In that letter, S&W asked DAS to clarify
t wo of    the     IFB requirements.         All    of   the other points         in the
letter     spoke    to    S&W's   view     that    the   specifications      it   called
attention to were unduly restrictive of competition.                       with respect

to   those       protest      grounds      which     allege    unduly       restrictive
specifications,          we   think   it   pertinent     to   note   our    comment   in
Datacom Systems Corporation, CAB No. P-64 at 27 (D.C. CAB January
11,1988):
     "       once a party knows or should have known of all
     the facts and circumstances necessary to form the basis
     of a protest, it simply cannot, without the consequence
     of dismissal, delay filing a protest with the Board for
     more than ten working days on the premise that it may
     pursue resolution of its objections to the procurement
     with agency officials."
Here, the specifications S&W complained of in its March 21 letter
                                                   -   5 -

as being unduly restrictive of competition constitute, in part, the
basis of the protest now under consideration.                                   Consequently,        the
record leaves no doubt that S&W knew of these grounds on March 21,
1986.         By failing to file               a   protest with the Board within ten

working days           of the         time    it prepared the March               21    letter,      S&W

caused     that    portion            of   the protest         alleging unduly           restrictive
specifications to be late.
        S&W    states       in    its        protest     that        the   protest     "is    made    in
accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations                                 [FAR]:        Part 33,
Subpart 33.1 -           Protests."            The FAR appl ies to Federal Executive

agencies (see 48 C.F.R. sec. 1.101 (1987Â»                              and does not in any way

govern    the     filing         of    a   protest      involving a         District government

procurement.           On the basis of S&W's statement, we presume that S&W

simply misunderstood the procedure for filing a protest involving a
procurement by a District government agency which is subordinate to
the Mayor of the District of Columbia,                               as is the case here.             In
this    regard,        we   reiterate          what      we    stated      in   MTI    Construction

Company,       Inc.,    supra at 71--i.e.,                   secs.    1-1181.4(C),       1-1189.3(1)

and 1-1189.8(b), when read in tandem with one another, make clear
how all such protests are to be filed.                           Therefore, a protester "is
not excused from complying with the                             [PPA' s]    filing     requirements
because       it in earnest sought,                    in the first         instance,        to obtain
resolution of its protest from the procuring agency." Id.                                    (Citation

omitted.)       Insofar as filing a protest with the procuring agency is

concerned, we indicated in Datacom Systems corporation, supra at 19

that the PPA does not preclude a party from initially complaining

to the procuring agency, and, as would be the case with any other
                                       - 6 -

controversy subject to our jurisdiction, we encourage settlement of
protests    between     the   protester   and    the   procuring     agency.      We
further pointed out that there are several options open to a party
to directly complain to the procuring officials without losing its

right of protest to the Board:
     One approach would be for the party to initially submit
     its complaint to the procuring officials, and if a
     satisfactory resolution does not appear to be shortly
     forthcoming, file a protective protest with the Board
     before the ten-working day period expires.       Another
     approach would be for the party to proceed to file a
     protest at the outset with the Board and either
     contemporaneously or thereafter pursue resolution of its
     complaint directly with the procuring officials while the
     protest is pending.
Id. at 19 and 20.
     We noted earlier that S&W, in its March 21 letter, asked for
clarification of two requirements which were included in the IFB.
Since,    at the time of the clarification request,              it did not have
sufficient    information     to determine whether           it had a      ground of
protest,    it would have been premature for S&W to file a protest
with the Board at that time regarding the unclarified matters.                     We

therefore    disagree    with   that   aspect    of    the    District's    argument
which     contends    that    the   protest      grounds      relating     to   S&W's
clarification requests should have been filed with the Board on
March 21.     The key date for determining the timeliness of S&W' s
protest regarding those requirements it sought clarification on is
the date it first received a definitive response to its inquiries
or the date when it became or should have became knowledgeable of a
DAS action which was adverse to its concerns.
     We     mentioned     previously      that     DAS       responded     to   S&W's
clarification requests by way of its Addendum No.                  4 to the IFB,
                                        - 7 -

and S&W acknowledged the addendum on June 10,                1986.   We think it

reasonable      to   infer   from   S&W's   acknowledgment    that   it read the

addendum before signing it.             After reading the addendum, S&W knew

or should have known whether and to what extent DAS had allayed it

concerns.       IF S&W had further concerns with the IFB requirements,

it should have protested to the Board no later than June 24, 1986.

since the protest grounds concerning the              IFB requirements which

were    the   subject   of   the    clarification requests were not raised

with the Board until July 15, 1986, they are untimely.

        For the reasons we have discussed, it is
        ORDERED that the District's motion to dismiss this protest

for    untimeliness     is   GRANTED,    and the   protest    is dismissed with

prejudice .
