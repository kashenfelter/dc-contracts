        The protester, SRECTrade, Inc., filed the present protest on April 7, 2013, challenging an
alleged award of a sole source contract by the District of Columbia Department of General
Services to Customer First Renewables, LLC for services related to wind and solar energy
purchasing. (See generally Protest.) On April 29, 2013, the District moved to dismiss this
matter based upon its decision to take corrective action in the subject procurement by cancelling
the proposed sole source award and announcing its intent to issue a competitive solicitation for
the required services. (Dist. Mot. to Dismiss 1.) In light of the Districtâ€™s proposed corrective
action, the protester also moved to withdraw its protest on May 1, 2013. (Protester Mot. to
Withdraw 1.) Therefore, the Board dismisses this protest as moot.

SO ORDERED.
