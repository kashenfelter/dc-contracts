    PROTEST OF:

          YALE INDUSTRIAL TRUCKS - MARYLAND, INC.

          Under IFB No. 7256-AA-39-0-7-AG
â€¢                                      ORDER

          On July 15, 1987, the Board received the above-captioned

    protest.      The District, on August 21,        1987, filed an agency

    report in response to the protest.           No comments on the agency

    report were     received    from   the   protester   by   the   Board.    On

    November 4,    1987, the District filed a motion to dismiss the

    protest as untimely.       As the Board had not received a response

    from the protester to the District's motion to dismiss,                  the

    Board issued an Order to Show Cause (dated February 19, 1988)

    directing that on or before February 29,             1988, the protester

    show cause,    if there be any,      why this protest should not be

    dismissed for failure to prosecute.            The Order to Show Cause

    also stated that in the event the protester failed to properly

    respond to the Order by the date stated, the protest would be

    dismissed forthwith.

          The Board having received no response from the protester

    by the stipulated date, it is

          ORDERED,    That     the protest     is dismissed with prejudice

    for failure to prosecute.
