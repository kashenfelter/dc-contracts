              On January 6, 1988, the Department of Administrative Services (CAS)

      issued Invitation for Bids No. 8149-AA-51-0-8-GM (IFB) in the sheltered

      market to obtain hand tool sets and other equipment.                      See the District of

      Columbia's Aqency Report, filed with the Board on April 15, 1988, at 2

      and exh. A thereto.            At the time of the formal bid openinq on February

      10,    1988,     DAS found Washi.nqton cable Supply,               Inc.   (WCSI) ,   to be the

      apparent low bidder and Battery Place to be the second low bidder.                        lsL.
              Battery Place filed this protest with the Board 1 on February 17,

      1988, alleging that the bid submitted by wesr was nome!:>ponslve.                       Battery

      Place arques that WCSI's bid was nonresponsive for two reasons:                       WCSI had

      made initialed changes to the paraqraphs relating to business interests



          1 This case oriqinated durinq the period when the District of
     Columbia contract Appeals Board was functioninq pursuant to
     Commissioner's Order No.9, D.C. Code, Supplement V (1978), as amended by
     Mayor's Order 82-224, 30 !:>Om 497 (January 28, 1983) and Mayor's Order
     86-65, 33 !:>Om 3006 (May 16, 1986).    Pursuant to the D.C. Procurement
     Practices Act of 1985 (PPA) , D.C. Code, sec. 1-1189.1 (1981), a new
     independent aqency denominated as the Contract Appeals Board was created.
     This new Board came into existence on August 1, 1988, and succeeded to
     the jurisdiction of all cases before the previously established Board.

District of Columbia AegIS'"
                                                                                                        JUN 2 1989

      in South Africa and Namibia which are set out in Special Condition 9 of

      the    IFB;    and       WCSI    had     failed     to use the appropriate bid                    form    in

      responding to an addendum to the IFB.                       See the Protest       ~tter.

             The    District          argues    in     its     Agency      Report    that    the paragraphs

      submitted by WSCI pursuant to Special COndition 9 do not contain material

      deviations       fram      the     requirements          of    the    IFB.      As     to   the    second

      allegation, the Distr5.ct argues that the IFB did not require that WSCI' s

      submission of its response to Addendum No. 1 be on the schedule sheet

      provided in the IFB.

             When this protest was filed DAS was still in the process of evaluat-

      ing bids, and no contract                ha~   been awarded.         ~   Agency Report at 3.

             Before this Board can consider the merits of any protest, the Board

      must first determine that the protest is properly before it and that it

      has jurisdiction to hear and decide the protest.                              In past decisions this

      Board has held that in order for a bidder to have a cognizable and viable
      protest such that the Board will have jurisdiction, the bidder must be

      aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of a contract.                                      A

      bidder is aggrieved when it suffers a loss or injury or when a legal

      right it has is violated by the act complained of.                              ~      the protests of

      A.A.    Beiro Construction.               Co..    Inc.,       1 P. D.    60    (D.C.   CAB 1987)         and

      Emergency One. Inc., CAB No.                     P-114    (D.C. CAB November 2, 1988).                   'lhe

      Board has also stated that a party is not aggrieved until official

      action,       adverse to it,           has been taken.               See the protests of Hood's

      Institutional Foods (D.C. CAB January 25,                            1989) and Systems Products .

    District of Columbia Register                                                                         . . 2 1989

                   In a protest such as this one, where a protester challenges the

          responsiveness of another's bid, official action sufficient to cause the

          protester to be aggrieved occurs when a contract is aWarded.                                 Absent such

          an action, this protest is premature and speculative. Id.                               Here, the mere

          submission of an allegedly nonresponsive bid by WCSI,                                  absent official

          agency action, does not have an injurious impact on Battery Place or any

          other uidder.         No      agen~'Y     action adverse to Battery Place has been taken.

                   Battery Place has failed to show that it is an aggrieved party.

          Therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear and decide the merits of

          the protest.
                   Accordingly,          for    the    reasons       set        forth   above,   the   protest   is

          dismissed for lack of jurisdiction .



â€¢                  The protest is dismissed.
