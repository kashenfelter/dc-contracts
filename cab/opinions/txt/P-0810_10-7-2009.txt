                                          OPINION
                                        Filing ID 27455802


        Protester CNA Corporation challenges the contracting officer’s determination that
CNA’s bid was nonresponsive for failure to submit a bid bond with good and sufficient
sureties as required by the bond requirements of the solicitation. The District filed a motion
to dismiss the protest as untimely, alleging that CNA filed its protest more than 10 days after
it knew, or should have known, of the basis for its protest. On the merits, the District asserts
that the contracting officer properly rejected CNA’s bid as nonresponsive since CNA
submitted with its bid an unacceptable bid guaranty. We agree with the District that CNA’s
protest was untimely filed. Accordingly, we dismiss the protest.

                                      BACKGROUND

       The District’s Office of Contracting and Procurement, on behalf of the District’s
Department of Transportation, issued Solicitation No. DCKA-2009-B-0025 in January 2009,
for the pavement restoration of local streets in the District of Columbia. (Agency Report
(“AR”) Ex. 1). Four bids were received and opened on the extended bid opening date, March
18, 2009 (AR at 3; AR Ex. 3). CNA was the apparent low bidder. CNA’s bid included as bid
guaranty five uncertified company checks totaling $2,712,640.25. (AR Ex. 2) CNA
submitted no other evidence of any bid guaranty in its bid package. Section I.8 of the IFB
(“Bid Guaranty”), taken from Section 102, Article 12, Bond Requirements, Bid Guaranty of
the Standards and Specifications for Highways and Structures (2005), provides as follows:

       On all bids of $100,000.00 or more, security is required to insure the execution
       of the contract. No bid will be considered unless it is so guaranteed. Each
       bidder must furnish with his bid either a bid bond (Form 2640-5) with good
       and sufficient sureties, a certified check payable to the Treasurer of the District
       of Columbia (uncertified check will not be accepted), negotiable United States
       bond (at par value), or an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount not less than
       five percent (5) of the amount of his bid . . . .

(AR Ex. 1).

        By Determination and Finding (“D&F”) dated March 24, 2009, the contracting officer
rejected CNA’s bid as nonresponsive. On April 13, 2009, the Chief Procurement Officer
approved an award to other than the low bidder. (AR Ex. 5) The D&F recommended award
to the second low bidder. (AR Ex. 5). On May 18, 2009, at a meeting requested by CNA, the
contracting officer informed Mr. John Cheeks of CNA that the CNA bid had been rejected as
nonresponsive for failure to submit an acceptable bid guaranty. (AR Ex. 8). CNA does not
dispute receiving oral notification. On May 27, 2009, the contracting officer sent CNA a
letter again informing CNA that its bid had been rejected as nonresponsive. On June 17,
2009, CNA filed this protest. The District filed a motion to dismiss the protest as untimely on
July 7, 2009.

                                         DISCUSSION

       We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03(a)(1).

        We begin by addressing the issue of whether CNA timely filed its protest. The
District asserts that CNA filed its protest more than 10 business days after May 18, 2009, the
date the contracting officer notified CNA in a meeting that CNA’s bid had been rejected as
non-responsive because of an inadequate bid guaranty. (AR Ex. 5). The District asserts that
because CNA knew that the District had rejected CNA’s bid on May 18, 2009, CNA should
have filed its protest within 10 business days of that date, that is, by June 1, 2009.

        D.C. Code § 2-309.08 (b)(2) requires the protester to file a protest not later than 10
business days after the basis of the protest is known or should have been known, whichever is
earlier. CNA does not challenge the District’s assertion that it informed CNA of the bid
rejection on May 18, 2009. CNA claims that it did not receive official written notification of
the bid rejection until June 4, 2009, and that it filed its protest within ten days of that date. In
making that assertion, CNA asks the Board to ignore the affidavit of Jerry Carter, contracting
officer, who personally informed CNA on May 18, 2009, that its bid had been rejected as
nonresponsive. At that meeting, CNA knew that the District rejected its bid. “A protester’s
receipt of oral information forming the basis of its protest is sufficient to start the 10-day time
period running; written notification is not required. See Swafford Indus., B-238055, Mar. 12,
1990, 90-1 CPD ¶ 268.” Optical Energy Technologies, B-401520, July 13, 2009, 2009 U.S.
Comp. Gen. LEXIS 138. Because CNA failed to submit its protest within 10 business days
after May 18, 2009, its protest is untimely. Accordingly, we dismiss the protest.
