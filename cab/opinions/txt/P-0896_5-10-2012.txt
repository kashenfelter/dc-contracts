                                                     OPINION
                                                Filing ID  44187484 

        Martha’s Table, Inc. (“Martha’s Table” or “protester”) has filed a protest challenging its removal
from the competitive range under a solicitation seeking a contractor to design and implement an in-school
youth workforce development program to support between 250-500 at-risk youths. (AR at Ex.1a, §B.1.)
The protester’s challenges generally concern (a) the District’s failure to evaluate the proposals in
accordance with the law and the terms of the solicitation, and (b) the District’s failure to conduct
meaningful discussions. (Protest 12-21, Sept. 26, 2011.) On October 17, 2011, the District filed a motion
to dismiss the protest as either untimely or for lack of standing.

         We find the protest timely and that the protester has standing. Further, the Board finds that the
District’s Office of Contracting and Procurement (“OCP”) violated procurement law by failing to follow
proper procedures in evaluating the proposals. This violation resulted in a materially flawed procurement
process warranting termination of the current contract effective no later than the close of the current
school year in June 2012. To the extent that the District seeks to procure these services for the summer
school session of 2012 and beyond, the District shall issue a request to the eleven offerors for revised
technical and cost proposals for the remainder of the base year and the option years. The District shall
evaluate the revised proposals in accordance with the law and the terms of the RFP. This protest is
sustained.

                                                 BACKGROUND

               On April 1, 2011, OCP issued a Request for Proposals for Solicitation No. DCCF-2011-R-3962-
SDA 1 (“RFP”) for a contractor to design and implement a quality, year-round educational program to
support between 250-500 at-risk youths.1 (AR at Ex. 1a.) Per the RFP, the District intended to issue a
contract consisting of a base year with four additional option years. (AR at Ex 1a, §§ F.1-F.2.4.) The RFP
was revised six times prior to the deadline for receipt of proposals on June 8, 2011. The revisions are as
follows: (i) on April 14, 2011, the due date was changed from April 22, 2011, to May 4, 2011; (ii) on
                                                            
1
 This solicitation follows an earlier solicitation issued in September 2010 for the same services. (See, e.g., Protest ¶
1, Sept. 26, 2011.)

                                                                                          CAB No. P-0896

April 26, 2011, (Amendment 0001), the due date was extended to May 13, 2011; (iii) on May 9, 2011
(Amendment 0002), the due date was extended to May 27, 2011; (iv) on May 18, 2011 (Amendment
0003), the RFP was replaced in its entirety and the due date was extended to May 31, 2011; (v) on May
26, 2011 (Amendment 0004), technical amendments were made to certain sections of the RFP and the due
date was extended to June 6, 2011; and (vi) the due date was extended for the final time, via E-Sourcing
message board, to June 8, 2011. (AR at Ex. 2.)

Terms of the Solicitation

      Under the Revised RFP, the District of Columbia was divided into two Service Delivery Areas
(“SDAs”):
             SDA 1: Wards 1, 2, 3, and 4
             SDA 2: Wards 5, 6, 7, and 8

                 (AR at Ex. 1b, § B.3.1.)

        The RFP stated: “It is the intent of the District to award at least one contract for each of the
SDAs. The District will award additional contracts based upon program needs and availability of funds.”
(Id.) Potential offerors were to submit proposals to design and implement a year-round in-school youth
program to provide services promoting academic achievement, successful graduation, awareness of and
readiness for post-secondary education, career preparation, and connections to employment. (AR at Ex.
1b, § C.1.)

        The RFP further stated that the District would award a contract to the responsible offeror(s)
whose offer(s) is most advantageous to the District (AR at Ex. 1c, § M.1.1) based upon the following
technical evaluation criteria: (1) Price Criterion, 10 points; (2) Technical Approach, 50 points, (3)
Technical Expertise, 30 points, (4) Past Performance, 10 points. (AR at Ex. 1c, §§ M.3.3.1 – M.3.3.4.)
The evaluation criteria also allowed an additional 10 technical bonus points for in kind/cash match
resources and 12 points for CBE preference, providing for a maximum 122 total points. (AR at Ex. 1c, §§
M.3.4.1, M.3.4.2, M.5.)

Ratings were to be assigned for each factor according to the scale below:

Numeric Rating     Adjective         Description

       0           Unacceptable      Fails to meet minimum requirements; e.g., no demonstrated capacity,
                                     major deficiencies which are not correctable; offeror did not address
                                     the factor.

       1           Poor              Marginally meets minimum requirements; major deficiencies which
                                     may be correctable.

       2           Minimally         Marginally meets minimum requirements; minor deficiencies which
                   Acceptable        may be correctable.

       3           Acceptable        Meets requirement; no deficiencies.

       4           Good              Meets requirements and exceeds some requirements; no deficiencies.

                                                                                            CAB No. P-0896

       5            Excellent        Exceeds most, if not all requirements; no deficiencies.


(AR at Ex. 1c, § M.2.)

        According to the Procurement Chronology prepared by Contract Specialist, Crystal Farmer-
Linder, the minimum solicitation requirements were contained in Sections B.3 (B.3.1, B.3.2, B.3.3),
C.5.2, and C.5.2.1. (AR at Ex. 2.) These sections provided:

        § B.3            SERVICE DELIVERY AREAS

        § B.3.1          For the purpose of this RFP and the ensuing contracts the
                         District will be divided into two Service Delivery Areas (SDAs);

                         SDA District 1: Wards 1, 2, 3, and 4.
                         SDA District 2: Wards 5, 6, 7, and 8.

                         It is the intent of the District to award at least one contract for
                         each of the SDAs. The District will award additional contracts
                         based upon program needs and availability of funds.

        § B.3.2          In order for an Offeror to be awarded a contract, the Offeror
                         must serve the entire SDA and the Offeror must operate
                         programming at a location within the SDA. The Offeror is not
                         limited to serving only youth who reside within that SDA and
                         the District reserves the right to refer eligible youth to any
                         Offeror awarded a contract who has capacity at the time.

        § B.3.3          If an Offeror submits proposals for both SDAs, and, if the
                         Offeror is awarded a contract for each SDA, each contract shall
                         stand alone. The awarded Offeror shall not co-mingle funds,
                         personnel, required activities, services or any other contract
                         requirement between the two contracts.

        § C.5.2          YOUTH POPULATION
                         The following youth population shall be targeted:

        § C.5.2.1        The Offeror shall provide services to youth who are most likely
                         to become disconnected. This represents youth who are low-
                         income individuals, between the ages of 14 and 21, and who are
                         currently in school (See Section C.3.12 for a definition of the
                         term “In-School Youth”)

                         (AR at Ex. 1b.)

        The District has also noted that other sections of the RFP required offerors to provide services to
students in the age range 14 to 21. (See Mot. to Dismiss 4-5, Oct. 17, 2011.) Those requirements are
contained in Sections C.1 and C.5.2.2. (Id. at 5.) They provide:

                                                                                        CAB No. P-0896

       § C.1                                    * * *

                       The program must focus on drop-out prevention and intervention
                       strategies for youth at-risk of not completing high school for a
                       maximum of fifty (50) youths ages 14 through 21, for a
                       minimum of ten (10) and a maximum of fifteen (15) hours per
                       week.

                       1. Age 14 to 21 years on the program start date;
                       2. A resident of the District of Columbia

                               in reading or math;
                           b. School dropout;
                           c. A homeless, runaway, or foster child;
                           d. Pregnant or parenting;
                           e. An offender or youth involved in the juvenile or criminal

The Evaluation of Proposals Chronology

         Eleven offerors submitted proposals in response to the RFP by the June 8 deadline. (AR at Ex.
2.) Between June 13 and June 17, 2011, the Technical Evaluation Panel (“Panel”), consisting of three
members of the Department of Employment Services (“DOES”), performed independent reviews of the
initial proposals and created a consensus panel report. (AR at Ex. 2.) According to the Procurement
Chronology, each proposal was redacted so that the Panel could perform a blind evaluation. (AR at Ex.
2.)

        Simultaneously, the Contracting Officer (“CO”) conducted his own review and scoring of each
proposal. (AR at Ex. 2.) The three independent scores of the panelists, the Panel’s consensus scores and
the CO’s scores were consolidated onto a Score Sheet along with comments by the Panel and the CO.
(AR at Ex. 2.)

       During the initial evaluation of proposals, the Panel and the CO each noted the strengths and
weaknesses of the Martha’s Table proposal. In the comments for subfactor M.3.3.2.f, the Panel stated:

               The Offeror proposed a [sic] year-round activities for 35 to 40 youth
               from Ward One ages 14-18 years old. This submission is too limited in
               scope by not providing services to the entire SDA and not providing
               services to 14-21 years old as required by the RFP.

                                                   4
                                                                                                   Martha’s Table, Inc.
                                                                                                      CAB No. P-0896


                             (AR at Ex. 2.)

      The Panel awarded the protester 2 out of a possible total of 5 points for subfactor M.3.3.2.f. (AR at
Ex. 2.) It did not discuss the age range as a factor for scoring any other subfactor of the solicitation. (See
AR at Ex. 2.) The Panel’s comments for other subfactors were, in fact, generally more indicative of the
following: “The Offeror has presented and addressed the basic requirement(s) within this subsection as
prescribed by the solicitation.” (AR at Ex. 2.) The Panel awarded the protester 30 out of 50 points for
Technical Approach. (AR at Ex. 2.)

              In reviewing the same proposal, the CO noted:

                             Not clear if program targets only youth in Wards 1 and 4 or if major
                             focus is on these wards with recruitment activities planned for 2 and 3.
                             Does not meet minimum requirement for age; excludes 19 to 21.

                             (AR at Ex. 2.)

This comment appeared next to every evaluation subfactor for Technical Approach. (AR at Ex. 2.) Thus,
the CO repeatedly penalized the offeror because of the deficiency in subfactor M.3.3.2.f. and assigned a
rating of 2 for every subfactor under Technical Approach.2 (See AR at Ex. 2.) The CO awarded the
protester 20 out of 50 points for Technical Approach. (AR at Ex. 2.)

         According to the District, proposals that “clearly demonstrated an inability to meet one or all of
the requirements [stated in Sections B.3, C.5.2, and C.5.2.1]” were immediately removed from the
competitive range by OCP. (AR at Ex. 2.) OCP determined that five offerors were outside the
competitive range for failing to meet the minimum requirements set forth in Sections B.3.2, C.5.2.1, or
B.3.3: (i) Citywide Computer Training, (ii) Job’s for America’s Graduates-DC, Inc., (iii) Ethiopian
Community Service and Development Council, (iv) Howard University (The Learning Center), and (v)
Priority Professional Development. (AR at Ex. 2.)

        First Round Best and Final Offers (“1st BAFO”) were conducted in writing with the remaining six
offerors, beginning July 12th and closing July 15th. (AR at Ex. 2.) The remaining “Offerors were provided
questions regarding noted deficiencies in their original proposal submissions.” (AR at Ex. 2.) Martha’s
Table was asked to:

                             [S]pecifically address the deficiencies/weaknesses listed below:

                             Technical
                             1. Please clarify the age range of the target population for the proposed
                                program. What methods will be utilized to target and recruit youth
                                residing in Wards 2 and 3?
                                (M.3.3.2.a)

  The CO and Panel each used similar approaches in evaluating proposals that were ultimately determined to be
outside of the competitive range. They often noted flaws relating to Sections B.3.2, C.5.2.1, and B.3.3. (See AR at
Ex. 2.) However, in the Panel’s assessment, the deficiency in subfactor M.3.3.2.f. was confined to that one
subfactor and the deficiency did not impact scoring in other subfactors. (See AR at Ex. 2.) On the other hand, the
CO consistently discussed the subfactor M.3.3.2.f deficiency in his analysis of multiple subfactors and, due to the
deficiency in subfactor M.3.3.2.f., he uniformly downgraded protester’s proposal across almost all subfactors. (See
AR at Ex. 2.)

                                                                 5

                                                                                                   CAB No. P-0896


                             (Protest Ex. A.)

        All six remaining offerors, including Martha’s Table, submitted responses to the 1st BAFO.3 (AR
at Ex. 2.) Citing an inability to reconvene the Panel to review the BAFO proposals in time to meet the
award deadline, the CO scored the BAFO submissions without the assistance of the Panel. (AR at Ex. 2.)
At this time, the CO then determined that Latin American Youth Center should be excluded from the
competitive range as “the Offeror’s proposal did not provide service to the full age range of the targeted
youth population.” (AR at Ex. 2.)

         Alluding to budgetary concerns in light of the proposed cost of services under the 1st BAFOs, the
District decided to hold a Second Round BAFO (“2nd BAFO”) with all five remaining offerors, including
Martha’s Table. The 2nd BAFO related to pricing only. (AR at Ex. 2.) The 2nd BAFO instructions were
that the “District sought a per participant cost range between $2,500.00 and $4,500.00.” (AR at Ex. 2.)
The request for 2nd BAFOs was issued July 28, 2011. (AR at Ex. 2.) During the 2nd BAFO review, OCP
conducted further analysis and “determined that Martha’s Table should have also been excluded from the
competitive range [for failure to provide service to the full range of the targeted youth population].” (AR
at Ex. 2.)

        At the conclusion of both BAFO rounds only four of the eleven offerors remained in the
competitive range. (AR at Ex. 2.) On August 15, 2011, the District awarded the contract to the highest
ranking remaining offeror, Dance Institute of Washington (“DIW”). (Mot. to Dismiss 4.)

The Protest

        Protester did not initially receive notice of award from the District. (Protest ¶ 39.) However, on
August 30, 2011, protester learned that an offeror to the solicitation had filed a protest of award. (Protest
¶ 33.) Protester requested a debriefing and, accordingly, was debriefed on September 12, 2011. (Protest
¶¶ 33-34.) The District created a notice of award after the debriefing and sent it to protester. (Protest ¶
39.) Following the debriefing, Martha’s Table filed its protest with this Board ten business days later on
September 26, 2011. It asserted five grounds for protest alleging: (i) the District’s failure to conduct
meaningful discussions or treat offerors equally during discussion; (ii) the District’s misapplication of
evaluation criteria; (iii) unreasonable evaluation of DIW and Martha’s Table with respect to the Past
Performance score; (iv) miscalculation of the Price Evaluation score; and (v) a fundamentally flawed
DOES procurement process. (Protest 12-21.)

I.     BOARD JURISDICTION

  The Procurement Chronology states that seventeen of the twenty offerors responded to the request for BAFOs.
(See AR at Ex. 2.) However, a total of only eleven offerors were ever involved in this solicitation. Notwithstanding
this typographical error, the Board can deduce that all six remaining offerors responded to the 1st BAFO because
other parts of the Procurement Chronology detail the determination by OCP that two offerors were not in the
competitive range and that four offerors were included in the competitive range and ranked according to their scores.
(See AR at Ex. 2.)


                                                                   6
                                                                                          Martha’s Table, Inc.
                                                                                             CAB No. P-0896

       We exercise jurisdiction over this protest and its underlying allegations pursuant to D.C. Code §
2-360.03(a)(1) (2011).

        A. Standing

        The District has argued that the protester is without standing because it did not have a reasonable
chance of award. (Mot. to Dismiss 6.) More specifically, the District argues that the protester was
properly eliminated from the competitive range because it did not agree to provide services to youth ages
14 through 21, a purportedly clear requirement of the contract. (See Mot. to Dismiss 5-7.)

          Martha’s Table protests its removal from the competitive range and challenges the evaluation
methodology. (See Martha’s Table Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss 4-6, Oct. 26, 2011.) Specifically, it alleges
that its score was improperly reduced by 30 points where at best only 5 points should have been deducted.
(Protest ¶ 15-16.) The four offerors determined to be within the competitive range did not receive similar
deductions because they were deemed to meet the requirements of the solicitation with respect to Section
C.5.2.1. (See AR at Ex. 2.) In fact, the awardee received a total score of 68 for its 1st BAFO; protester
received a score of 56. (See AR at Ex.2.) Therefore, but for the CO’s deduction across multiple
subfactors due to the deficiency in subfactor M.3.3.2.f, protester would arguably have been next in line
for award. Indeed, by the District’s own admission, it is uncertain where protester would have ranked but
for the CO’s evaluation methodology that resulted in 10 points less being assigned to protester than had
been assigned by the Panel.

        In addition, protester alleges that the awardee, DIW, and itself each received a score of 7 for past
performance and past experience. However, the past performance score consisted of two subfactors
worth 5 points each based on: (i) experience with DOES or another funder, and (ii) general past
performance. (AR at Ex. 1c, § M.3.3.4.) Protester argues that it has significant experience working with
DOES while the awardee does not; therefore, they should not have received similar scores for this factor.
(Protest ¶ 58.) Again, protester challenges the integrity of the evaluation based on the number of points
assigned to the awardee and itself for this factor. The scoring discrepancy for subfactor M.3.3.2.f along
with the scoring discrepancy for past performance and past experience, taken together, result in the
protester not only being next in line for award, but potentially prevailing ahead of the awardee.

        This Board has long held that in order to have standing a bidder must be next in line for award in
order to show that it has suffered, or will suffer, direct economic injury as a result of the adverse agency
action. Scientific Games, Inc., CAB No. P-0294, 41 D.C. Reg. 3666, 3670 (Sept. 24, 1993). However,
this Board’s protest jurisdiction turns on whether the protester has suffered, or will suffer, direct
economic injury as a result of the adverse agency action. See M.C. Dean, Inc., CAB No. P-0528, 45 D.C.
Reg. 8746, 8749-50 (Apr. 16, 1998). Accordingly, the Board has also held that protesters have standing
when challenging the integrity of the manner in which offeror proposals are scored even if they are not
next in line for award. In CUP Temporaries, Inc., CAB No. P-0474, 44 D.C. Reg. 6841, 6844 (July 3,
1997), the Board held that “[b]ased on the final rankings of the evaluators, it is clear that the Protester is
ranked third among the offerors on the RFP. Nevertheless, since the Protester challenges the integrity of
the manner in which the agency officials scored all the offerors the Protester meets the standing
requirements.”




                                                      7
                                                                                          Martha’s Table, Inc.
                                                                                             CAB No. P-0896

         In ACS State and Local Solutions, Inc., P-0691, 52 D.C. Reg. 4227 (Aug. 31, 2004), this Board
considered the standing of a protester challenging an award on the basis of improper evaluation of the
protester’s and awardee’s proposals. In that instance, the District argued that ACS lacked standing
because it had been determined to be non-responsive during the solicitation and, therefore, could not be
next in line for award. See id. at 4227-28. This Board held that ACS did have standing to protest because
“its proposal was not clearly non responsive and was not treated as non-responsive by the contracting
officer.” See id. at 4228 (holding that the protester had standing under the clearly non responsive standard
but ultimately denying the protest on the merits). In this case, the District itself did not treat protester’s
proposal as clearly non responsive in that it requested 1st BAFO and 2nd BAFO proposals and the protester
was not removed from the competitive range until after the District’s receipt of the 2nd BAFO proposal.

         The Board’s holding in CUP Temporaries, Inc. and ACS State and Local Solutions, Inc. is readily
distinguishable from those instances where a protester was found to not have standing. For example, in
St. John’s Cmty. Serv., CAB No. P-0555, 46 D.C. Reg. 8594 (Mar. 23, 1999), the protester was third in
line for the contract. St. John’s argued that it not only challenged the awardee, but also “the entire
procurement process as inconsistent with federal and local law.” Id. at 8596. The Board, however, found
that “this generality cannot recast the evaluation and award challenges” of St. John’s and dismissed the
protest. Id. Similarly, in Thomas, CAB No. P-0579, 46 D.C. 8618, 8620 (May 11, 1999), the Board found
that where the protester challenged the integrity of the manner in which the agency officials scored all
offerors, “[t]his general argument cannot substitute for showing how the six higher-ranked offerors were
improperly evaluated such that Thomas would be in line for award if his protest were sustained. . . .
Thomas has not shown any reasonable possibility of being in line for award even if his evaluation
challenges were sustained.”

        In the instant case, the protester has specifically challenged the scoring methodology due to the
CO’s across the board application of a deficiency that is based on the requirement of a single factor.
Protester has also challenged the past performance and past experience scores for both itself and the
awardee. Meanwhile, the District has allegedly indicated that it does not know where protester would
have ranked but for the CO’s evaluation methodology. In other words, the protester may have had a
reasonable chance of award. Based on the foregoing, we find that protester’s claims are sufficient to
show its status as an interested party with a direct economic injury as a result of the adverse agency
action. Accordingly, protester has standing to bring this protest.

        B. Timeliness

        The District has argued in the alternative that this Board lacks jurisdiction because the protest is
untimely. The District asserts that if the protester was not properly eliminated from the competitive range
then the RFP is ambiguous with respect to the age requirement contained in Section C.5.2.1 of the RFP.
And, therefore, under CAB Rule 302.2(a) and “pursuant to D.C. Official Code § 2-360.08(b)(1), this
protest is untimely.” (District Reply to Matha’s Table’s Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss 4, Nov. 3, 2011
[hereinafter District Reply].)

        Under CAB Rule 302.2(a), “[a] protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which
are apparent prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed with the
Board prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals.” (emphasis added.) The Board
has held that “[a] bidder who fails to seek clarification of an ambiguity on the face of a solicitation prior

                                                      8
                                                                                              Martha’s Table, Inc.
                                                                                                 CAB No. P-0896

to bid opening risks a contrary interpretation of the allegedly ambiguous provision and is precluded from
raising such issues to the Board after opening.” Md. Constr., Inc., CAB No. P-0650, 50 D.C. Reg. 7398,
7399 (Jan. 17, 2002).

         In its proposal, protester offered to provide services to students in the age range of 14-18,4 that is,
students between the ages of 14 and 21, consistent with the terms of the RFP. The District, however,
treated and understood this requirement to be wholly inclusive of the entire age range. The debriefing
slides presented to Martha’s Table amended the express language of the requirement by stating that “the
age range for the youth population is 14-21. Offeror’s proposal will only target youth ages 14-18, thus
excluding youth ages 19-21.” (Protest Ex. C, at 13 (emphasis added).) For its part, protester has argued
that the District’s “exchanges with offerors did not express the District’s current position that any
proposal that did not explicitly propose to serve the population of active high school students ages 19-21
would be eliminated.” (Martha’s Table’s Resp. to District’s Mot. to Dismiss 7.) Therefore, at issue is
whether this ambiguity was “apparent” prior to bid opening.

         As previously stated, an ambiguity that is apparent shall be filed with the Board prior to bid
opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. CAB Rule 302.2(a). However, a contractor “is not
normally required (absent a clear warning in the contract) to seek clarification of any and all ambiguities,
doubts or possible differences in interpretation.” Fry Comm., Inc. v. United States, 22 Cl. Ct. 497, 509
(1991). Thus, this Board is not time barred from reviewing “latent ambiguities in the requirements” of
solicitations. See THL Assocs., CAB No. P-0643, 49 D.C. Reg. 3371, 3373 (Aug. 3, 2001).

        It is commonly accepted that the determination of whether an ambiguity is latent is a question of
law, the determination of which is made on a case-by-case basis. Grumman Data Sys. Corp. v. Dalton,
88 F.3d 990, 997 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (citing Interstate Gen. Gov’t Contractors, Inc. v. Stone, 980 F.2d 1433,
1435 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). However, we have some “guidance in making this determination.” Grumman
Data Sys. Corp., 88 F.3d at 997. A latent ambiguity exists where “the ambiguity is ‘neither glaring nor
substantial nor patently obvious.’” Id. (quoting Cmty. Heating & Plumbing Co. v. Kelso, 987 F.2d 1575,
1579 (Fed. Cir. 1993)).

         In Capitol Paving of D.C., Inc., CAB No. P-0736, 54 D.C. Reg. 2036, 2039 (Oct. 12, 2006), this
Board noted that the alleged ambiguity was apparent where the heading of the solicitation cover page read
“Page 1 through 131 Includes Sec. B thru M and attachments” while a block of the cover page referenced
only section B through L. Accordingly, the Board held that Capitol Paving had an obligation to inquire as
to whether there was a Section M and whether offerors were required to comply with the requirements of
the section. See id.

              Section C.5.2.1 states:

                             The Offeror shall provide services to youth who are most likely to
                             become disconnected. This represents youth who are low-income
                             individuals, between the ages of 14 and 21, and who are currently in
                             school.

 Martha’s Table has asserted that its “proposal did not exclude 19-21 year olds, but instead simply emphasized the
age group that is typically in high school, namely 14-18 year olds.” (Protest ¶ 52.)

                                                               9
                                                                                                Martha’s Table, Inc.
                                                                                                   CAB No. P-0896

                             (AR at Ex. 1b (emphasis added).)

         The District has taken the position that if the protester was not properly eliminated from the
competitive range, then Section C.5.2.1 is ambiguous, and, as a result, this protest is untimely pursuant to
D.C. Code § 2-360.08(b)(1). However, the Board finds that the ambiguity is at best a latent ambiguity
that was not apparent prior to bid opening, and, therefore Section 2-360(b)(1) does not bar this protest. It
was not clear to the protester until the time of debriefing that the District viewed Section C.5.2.1 as a
totally inclusive requirement. The use of the word “between” in connection with an in-school youth
program is reasonably read to detail the outer bounds of eligibility for the program. Most high school
students are between the ages 14-18, though some may exceed that age range. The District interpreted the
requirement to mean that proposals must indicate that services would be provided to in-school youth
across the entire age range. We find that in the present protest, prior to bid opening, there was no patently
obvious disagreement regarding the terms of the solicitation as in the case of Capitol Paving of D.C., Inc.

          The targeted age range requirement was later clarified by the District through the rewording, “the
age range for the youth population is 14-21.” (Protest Ex. C, at 13 (emphasis added).) However, this
clarification was not made until debriefing, after contract award. Since the ambiguity did not become
apparent until after the close of the solicitation, the use of the word “between” resulted in a latent
ambiguity, not a patently obvious ambiguity in the RFP’s requirements, and thus this protest is not subject
to D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 27, § 302.2(a) (2002). Accordingly, the protest is timely under CAB Rule
302.2(b).5

II. EVALUATION PROCESS

         The Board’s standard of review for proposal evaluations and the related selection decision is
whether the District’s actions were reasonable, in accord with the evaluation and selection criteria
identified in the solicitation and whether there were violations of procurement laws or regulations. See,
Trifax Corp., CAB No. P-0539, 45 D.C. Reg. 8842, 8847 (Sept. 25, 1998); see also Health Right, Inc.,
D.C. Health Coop., Inc., & The George Washington Univ., CAB Nos. P-0507, P-0510, P-0511, 45 D.C.
Reg. 8612, 8630 (Oct. 15, 1997). In applying this standard of review, we find that the District’s actions
were not consistent with the evaluation and selection criteria contained in the RFP resulting in a material
violation such that the selection decision cannot be supported based on the evidence submitted for review.

        According to the Procurement Chronology, the protester was excluded from the competitive
range because its proposal did not provide services to the full age range of targeted youth. (AR at Ex. 2.)
And, although the District reported that it removed protester from the competitive range at some point
after protester submitted its 1st BAFO proposal,6 the protester was not removed from the competitive
range until late in the solicitation process, after submitting proposals in response to 1st BAFO and 2nd
BAFO requests. In analyzing the protester’s 2nd BAFO submission, the CO noted:

                                                            
5
 CAB Rule 302.2(b) states that “[p]rotests other than those covered in paragraph (a) shall be filed with the Board
not later than ten (10) business days after the basis of the protest is known or should have been known, whichever is
earlier.”
6
 The Procurement Chronology states that after the 1st BAFO the District realized that Martha’s Table should have
been excluded from the competitive range. However, it was included in the 2nd BAFO request for proposals
purportedly due to an administrative error.


                                                                10
                                                                                         Martha’s Table, Inc.
                                                                                            CAB No. P-0896

                No change in rating. Offeror’s BAFO proposal provides specific
                information about recruiting efforts targeting youth in Wards 2 and 3.
                However, the Offeror does not meet the minimum need in re age; only
                youth 14-18.

                (AR at Ex. 2.)

        Upon his initial review, the CO awarded the protester a rating of 2 across all subfactors in the
Technical Approach category. (See AR at Ex. 2.) A score of 2 represents that the proposal “marginally
meets minimum requirements; minor deficiencies which may be correctable.” (AR at Ex. 1c, § M.2.)
The CO also indicated: “Not clear if program targets only youth in Wards 1 and 4 or if major focus is on
these wards with recruitment activities planned for 2 and 3. Does not meet minimum requirement for age;
excludes 19-21.” (AR at Ex. 2.)

         Although the CO’s score of 2 indicates that the response to that particular requirement contains a
minor deficiency, by penalizing the protester in every category because of that single criterion, the minor
deficiency became an insurmountable deficiency. As a result, the protester has argued that the District
“grossly misapplied the evaluation criteria” and, as a result, “MT’s proposal was downgraded by 30
points for the single weakness [failure to provide services to the entire age range under Section C.5.2.1.]”
(Protest 15.)

        We agree that the CO misapplied the evaluation criteria. In establishing the competitive range,
the District arbitrarily identified the requirement of Section C.5.2.1 and raised its importance to the level
of a mandatory minimum requirement. The mandatory minimum requirement was used to disqualify the
protester even though such mandatory requirement was never communicated to the offerors either in the
language of the solicitation or in the subsequent discussions. By failing to disclose a mandatory
minimum requirement, the evaluation process was inconsistent with the terms of the solicitation and in
violation of procurement law.

         A mandatory minimum requirement is pass/fail in nature and may lead to the outright rejection of
a proposal that falls short of what [it] specif[ies].” Banknote of Am., Inc. v. United States, 56 Fed. Cl.
377, 382 (2003). The protester’s only noted deficiency at the time of exclusion from the competitive
range was the failure to provide services to youths 19-21. (See AR at Ex. 2.) The across the board
reduction in score in the Technical Approach category, along with the decision to exclude offerors from
the competitive range who did not meet the requirement of Section C.5.2.1, meant that an offeror who did
not satisfy the requirement had, in effect, no chance at award.

         Accordingly, this Board must determine whether the language of the RFP contained sufficient
notice to offerors that Section C.5.2.1 was, in fact, a mandatory minimum requirement of the solicitation.
“[P]rocurement practice dictates that “mandatory minimum requirements must be clearly identified as
such so as to put offerors on notice of the serious consequences of failing to meet the requirement.’”
Urban Alliance Found., CAB Nos. P-0886, P-0887, P-0890, P-0891, P-0892, slip op. at 11 (Feb. 15,
2012) (quoting Banknote Corp. of Am., Inc. v. United States, 56 Fed.Cl. at 382). If one factor in an
evaluation is predominantly more important than another, this information should be disclosed to offerors.
Isratex, Inc. v. United States, 25 Cl. Ct. 223, 230 (1992). A procuring agency should provide “fullest
possible disclosure” of the relative importance of all evaluation factors. Id.

                                                                                            CAB No. P-0896

         In Urban Alliance we considered Section C.5.2.1 with respect to the SDA 2 portion of this
solicitation, which contains the same language as in the SDA 1 portion of the RFP. See Urban Alliance
Found., CAB Nos. P-0886, P-0887, P-0890, P-0891, P-0892, slip op. at 4-5. We held that the “mandatory
minimum requirements were never communicated to the offerors either in the language of the solicitation
or in the subsequent discussions.” Id. at slip op. at 11. With respect to the language of Section C.5.2.1,
we reaffirm that the language of Section C.5.2.1 “is not distinguishable as creating a mandatory minimum
requirement when compared to other sections in the solicitation that are . . . not considered by the District
to create a mandatory minimum requirement.” Id. at slip op. at 12.

         Furthermore, the Board finds that at no point in its BAFO discussions with the protester did the
District ever communicate the importance of this section as a mandatory minimum requirement. For
example, OCP wrote:

                [S]pecifically address the deficiencies/weaknesses listed below:

                Technical
                2. Please clarify the age range of the target population for the proposed
                   program. What methods will be utilized to target and recruit youth
                   residing in Wards 2 and 3?
                   (M.3.3.2.a)

                (Protest Ex. A.)

Nothing in the language of the above-referenced provision rectifies the failure of the solicitation to give
notice by indicating that responses to Section C.5.2.1. must include the provision of services to the full
targeted age range of 14-21.

        The Board finds that the protester was greatly prejudiced by the District’s failure to follow proper
evaluation procedures given that the protester could have received the highest technical score of all
offerors but for an improper evaluation process. Bidders should not have been excluded from the
competitive range for failing to meet mandatory minimum requirements absent clear notice that failure to
address those requirements would result in disqualification. See Urban Alliance Found., CAB Nos. P-
0886, P-0887, P-0890, P-0891, P-0892, slip op. at 14. These findings constitute sufficient basis for
sustaining the present protest and, as such, the Board finds it unnecessary to address any other allegation
by the protester.

Conclusion

        Because the District violated procurement law in evaluating the proposals, the award to DIW was
unreasonable. The Board hereby directs the District to terminate the contract awarded under this RFP
effective no later than the close of the current school year in June 2012. To the extent that the District
