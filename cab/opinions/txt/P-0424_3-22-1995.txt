                       Opinion by Administrative Judge Cynthia G. Hawkins-Le6n, with Administrative Judges
                Jonathan D. Zischkau and Lorilyn E. Simkins, concurring.



                                   OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS


                Procedural Hist.ory

                      On November 29, 1994, Crawford/Edgewood Managers, Inc. (" Protestor or              II


                "Crawford") filed a protest of the award of emergency contract number JA/95394 by the
                Department of Human Services ("DHS"), Commission on Social Services ("CSS"), Office of
                Emergency Shelter and Support Services ("OESSS") to REO Management (" REO or               II


                "awardee").

                        As can be deduced from the November 29 filing, the Protestor's grounds for the protest
                are: (1) that a conflict of interest has been caused by REO's current status as a managing agent
                for property owners. As a managing agent, REO currently provides temporary, transitional
                housing for the District of Columbia. The Protestor contends that the contract requires the
                successful bidder to manage the same properties as currently managed by REO, thus allowing
                a doubled reimbursement for duties it is already performing; and (2) that REO lacks the
                capability and experience to perform the contract.

                       Pursuant to Board Rule 306.1,36 D.C. Reg. 2713 (April 21, 1989), the District filed
               a Motion to Dismiss on December 27, 1994. The District moved the Board to dismiss the
               protest with prejudice on the grounds that: (1) the Protestor is not an aggrieved party because
               it would not be in line for award if the protest were successful; and (2) Protestor has failed to
               present a clear and concise statement of the legal and factual grounds of its protest.

                    Crawford did not respond to the Motion to Dismiss. Pursuant to Board Rule 307.4, 36
           D.C. Reg. 2714 (1989), when a Protestor fails to file comments on an agency report or
           dispositive motion filed in lieu thereof, the factual allegations in the protest that are not admitted
           by the District, or otherwise corroborated on the record, may be disregarded. Alternatively, in
           accordance with Board Rule 110.5, 36 D.C. Reg. 2692 (1989), in light of Protestor's failure to
           file a timely opposition to the District's motion, the Board may, ifit so chooses, treat the motion
           as conceded. Heller Electric Co., Inc., CAB NO. P-244 , December 23, 1991, 39 D.C. Reg.
           4373; Barcode Technologies, Inc. , CAB No. P-298, January 16, 1992, 39 D.C. Reg. 4387 . In
           this case, as will be discussed below, since the Board has determined that the Protestor is not
           an aggrieved party, it will not be necessary for the Board to determine whether it should
           disregard any or all of the factual allegations.




                   By emergency solicitation dated October 28, 1994, titled "Market Survey," DRS
           requested proposals for Emergency Contract No . JA/95394. This emergency contract was for
           the provision of temporary shelter, resident and facility management, security services and other
           related services for the transitional housing of 265 homeless families in apartment units currently
           leased by the District of Columbia. The emergency solicitation was for the award of three
           aggregate clusters of transitional housing. The offerors could submit offers on one or more of
           the clusters. The contractor was to begin services on or around November 4, 1994. The
           contract was self-described as a cost reimbursement contract with a fixed fee component. The
           Market Survey included a series of twelve questions to be answered that concerned the
           responsibility of the offerors. Offerors were given until noon on November 2, 1994 to submit
           their offers. Protest, Exhibit 1; Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit 1.

                  On October 31, 1994 and November 1, 199.4, DRS transmitted via facsimile the above-
           described emergency solicitation to seven potential offerors. The seven potential offerors sent
           the solicitation were: (1) Anchor Development Corporation ("Anchor"); (2) 16-17 Street
           Associates ("16-17"); (3) Crawford/Edgewood Managers, Inc.; (4) North South Alternatives,
           Inc. ("North"); (5) National REO Management, Inc. ("REO"); Purpose, Inc. ("Purpose"); and
           Kingdom Property ("Kingdom"). Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit 2.

                  On November 2, 1994, the DRS contract specialist responsible for the solicitation wrote
           a memorandum to the DRS contracting officer providing a summary of the four proposals that
           had been received by the deadline. The summary indicated that the prices for the period from
           November 4 through November 30 were as follows:

            Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit 3.

                    On November 23, 1994, the President of REO informed DHS' contracting officer by
           letter that it was "willing to accept a 21 day contract for Emergency Solicitation #JA95394 at
           a per diem rate of $4,575 or $96,079 for a 21 day term... available and ready to take over
           th[e] contract on November 28, 1994." Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit 5, page 1.

                   An undated memorandum from the DHS contract specialist to the DHS contracting officer
           recommended that the contract be awarded to REO based upon an evaluation of the cost/price
           bid by the four offerors. It was recommended that the contract be awarded in the amount of
           $96,079.20 for the period November 28, 1994 through December 18, 1994. The contracting
           officer approved this recommendation on November 23, 1994. Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit 5,
           page 2.

                   By letter dated November 23, 1994, the contracting officer notified the three unsuccessful
           offerors that they had not been selected for award. The letter informed them that "your offer
           has been determined, from a price standpoint, to be no longer competitive and, therefore, cannot
           be considered for an award under the above referenced solicitation .... " Motion to Dismiss,
           Exhibit 5, page 3.




                   1A handwritten notation on Exhibit 3 to the Motion to Dismiss indicates that this offeror

              On November 23, 1994, the District executed Emergency Contract No. JA/95394 with
        REO for a contract period of November 28, 1994 through December 18, 1994 in the amount of
        $96,079.20.

                On November 29, 1994, Crawford filed the instant protest with the Board.

               On December 16, 1994, a bilateral modification to the emergency contract was executed
        which extended the contract period for an additional thirteen days (until December 31, 1994) for
        an additional amount of $57,967.35. Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit 6.                         .


        Decision

                A. Clear and Concise Statement

               One of the two grounds for dismissal cited by the District is the protest's lack of a clear
        and concise statement of protest grounds as required by the Board's Rules.

                As is stated in the Board's Rules, the Protestor, not the Board, has the responsibility of
        providing a clear and concise statement of the protest. Board Rule 302. l(c), 36 D.C. Reg. 2711
        (Apri121, 1989). See also U.S. Sprint Communications Company, 1 P.D. 33 (D.C. CAB 1987);
        and Metropolitan Pest Control, Inc., 2 P.D. 126 (D.C. CAB 1989). Specifically, Board Rule
        302. 1(c) requires the Protestor to file a protest which includes

               [a] clear and concise statement of the legal and factual grounds of the protest,
               including copies of relevant documents, and citations to statutes, regulations or
               contract provisions claimed to be violated.

        To this end, the Board has previously held that

               ... neither the P[rocurement] P[ractices] A[ct] nor the Board's rules of practice
               and procedure imposes upon the Board the responsibility to untangle the grounds
               of a protest and the evidence to support such grounds.

        Track-Tech International, CAB No. P-231 , October 12, 1990, 38 D.C. Reg. 3137, 3139. See
        also NAPA Development Corp., Inc., CAB No. P-324, November 16, 1992,40 D.C. Reg. 4702,
        citing Prisma Construction & Management Corp., CAB No. P-342, October 21, 1992,40 D.C.
        Reg. 4638, 4639.

              In the instant case, the Board finds that the Protestor's protest filed on November 29,
        1994 was sufficient to meet the standard established by Board Rule 302.1(c). Therefore, this
        ground of the District's Motion to Dismiss is DENIED.

                    B. Aggrieved Party

                    Section 903 of the Procurement Practices Act of 1985 ("PPA") establishes the Board's
            jurisdiction. D.C. Code §11189.3. Specifically, section 903 states that

                    [t]he Board shall be the exclusive hearing tribunal for, and shall have jurisdiction
                    to review and determine de novo:

                    (1) Any protest of a solicitation or award of a contract addressed to the Board by
                    any actual or prospective bidder or offeror, or a contractor who is aggrieved in
                    connection with the solicitation or award of a contract ....

            Id.

                    As the facts demonstrate, Crawford was fourth in line for the contract award and in its
            protest it has not challenged the second and third ranked offerors. Consequently, Crawford is
            not in line for the award of the contract should its protest be sustained and, therefore, is not an
            interested or aggrieved party for purposes of the Board's jurisdiction. In sum, the Protestor
            lacks standing to bring this protest. Scientific Games, Inc., CAB No. P-294, September 24,
            1993,41 D.C. Reg. 3666; Unfoldment, Inc., CAB No. P-358, September 17, 1993,41 D.C.
            Reg. 3656; O'Donnell Construction Company, CAB No ..P-340, April 2, 1993, 40 D.C. Reg.
            5063.

                   As the Board has held previously, this determination is in keeping with a number of
            Federal procurement decisions on point. Specifically, the Comptroller General has held that a
            Protestor will not be deemed interested, pursuant to the Competition in Contracting Act of
                                            II          II


            1984,31 U.S.C. § 3551(2), if the Protestor would not be in line for award should its protest be
            upheld. The GSBCA has made a similar holding. See generally MTI-RECYC, A Joint Venture,
            CAB No. P-287, October 1, 1992,40 D.C. Reg. 4554.

                   ACCORDINGLY, based upon the facts, legal precedent and reasoning set forth above,
            the protest is hereby DISMISSED, with prejUdice.
