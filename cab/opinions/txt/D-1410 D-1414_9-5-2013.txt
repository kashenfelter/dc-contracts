                             ORDER DENYING SUBPOENA REQUEST
                                                Filing ID 54034461

       Before the Board is the Appellant’s request for a subpoena ad testificandum for Ms.
Caroline Baldwin. Specifically, on August 29, 2013, the Appellant moved the Board to issue a
subpoena to compel Ms. Baldwin to testify at the hearing proceedings in this matter scheduled
for September 16, 2013, through September 27, 2013. (Appellant’s Mot. for Trial Subpoena for
Caroline Baldwin.) The accompanying subpoena form filed by the Appellant provides for
service of the requested subpoena upon Ms. Baldwin at an address in the State of Maryland
approximately 60 miles from the Board’s location. (Appellant’s Proposed Trial Subpoena for
Caroline Baldwin 1.)1

       The Board has the power to compel, by subpoena, the attendance of a witness for the
taking of testimony at a hearing on the merits conducted before the Board. D.C. CODE § 2-
360.06(a) (2011). Such subpoenas are enforced by the District of Columbia Superior Court. Id.
§ 2-360.06(b). Under the Board’s rules, a subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a
hearing may be served at any place consistent with the subpoena service rules of the District of
Columbia Superior Court. Board Rule 114.5 (D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 27, § 114.5 (2002)).

        In this regard, a subpoena issued by the Superior Court to compel the attendance of a
witness may be served either within the District of Columbia or “at any place without the District
of Columbia that is within twenty-five miles of the place of the hearing or trial specified in the
subpoena.” D.C. CODE § 11-942(a) (2001). Consistent with statute, the Superior Court’s rules
similarly provide that a subpoena for a hearing may be served in either the District or at any
place outside of the District but that is within 25 miles of the place of the hearing or trial. D.C.
Super. Ct. R. Civ. P. 45(b)(2).2

       Thus, under the foregoing legal provisions, the Board can not issue a hearing subpoena to
be served on a non-party outside of a 25 mile radius of the Board’s location. In the instant case,
however, the Appellant seeks the issuance of a subpoena to be served on Caroline Baldwin at an
1
  In particular, Ms. Baldwin’s designated address for service of the proposed subpoena is in Avenue, Maryland.
2
   The rule provides, however, that the court may authorize the service of a subpoena at any other place when an
applicable statute provides for this action and upon proper application and cause shown. Id. The Appellant has
cited to no other statute that provides authorization for issuance of a subpoena in this matter beyond the Board’s 25
mile limitation.
                                                             Keystone Plus Construction Corp.
                                                                   CAB Nos. D-1410, D-1414


address in Maryland approximately 60 miles from the Board’s location. As set forth herein, this
distance is outside of the scope of the District of Columbia Superior Court’s subpoena
compulsory power and, thus, the Board’s as well.

      For the foregoing reasons, the Board denies the Appellant’s motion for the issuance of a
subpoena ad testificandum for Caroline Baldwin.

SO ORDERED.
