     For the protester: James Hudson, Esquire. For the Govern-

    Opinion     by   Administrative     Judge   Booker,                    with
Administrative Judges Davis and Marlin concurring.

                                  OPINION

      On January 25,    1988, the District of Columbia Department
of Administrative      Services     (DAS)    issued   Invitation   for     Bids

No.   8134-AA-73-0-8-GL     (IFB)     in    the   sheltered      market     for

Automated Data Processing         (ADP)     supplies and printing paper.

DAS had received seven bids on aggregate groups 1-9 and 10-18

at the time of bid opening on March 16, 1988.                 LaDorn Systems
Corporation (LaDorn) was found to be the apparent low bidder on

aggregate group 1-9 and AC*JAN Group Associates, Inc.               (AC*JAN)

was found to be the apparent low bidder for aggregate group 10-
18.

      On March 18,   1988, Systems Products,          Inc.    (Systems),    one
of the bidders on the IFB,        filed this protest with the Board 1



     1This case originated during the period when the District
of Columbia Contract Appeals Board was functioning pursuapt to
Commissioner's Order No.9, D.C. Code, Supplement V (1978), as
amended by Mayor's Order 82-224, 30 DCMR 497 (January 28, 1983)
and Mayor's Order 86-65, 33 DCMR 3006 (May 16, 1986). Pursuant
to the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985 (PPA) , D.C. Code,
sec. 1-1189.1 (1987 Replacement), a new independent agency
                                                 (continued ... )
                                              - 2 -
alleging that LaDorn is unable                       to comply with the terms of the
IFB     and    is,     therefore,         nonresponsible                and     ineligible        for

contract       award.         On March         22,     1988,          Systems    filed     another
protest with the Board alleging that AC*JAN is also unable to
comply        with     the     terms          of     the        IFB     and,     therefore,        is
nonresponsible          and    ineligible            for    contract           award.      systems
requests        that     the       eligibility             of     LaDorn        and     AC*JAN     be
thoroughly investigated,               the contract award be delayed until
their     respective          eligibility            can        be     determined,        and     the
contract be awarded to the lowest responsive and responsible

bidder.        Systems also requests that the Board award it bid
preparation costs and attorney fees.                             Because both of Systems'
protests deal with the same IFB,                        the same circumstances,                   and
the    same    allegations,          the      Board        had        previously        decided    to
consolidate these protests.
        On May 27, 1988, the District filed its Agency Report and
Motion to Dismiss with the Board.                               The District acknowledges
that    at    the    time     of    the       filing       of the        Agency Report,           the
District       was   conducting           a   responsibility              evaluation        of    the
bidders and had not yet made a responsibility determination as
to LaDorn or AC*JAN.                In its Motion to Dismiss the District
contends the Board is without                        jurisdiction to consider this

     l( ... continued)
denominated as the Contract Appeals Board was created.     This
new Board carne into existence on August 1, 1988, and succeeded
to the jurisdiction of all cases before the previously
established Board.

protest on the merits because it is premature.                               The District
argues, 2 citing the Board's ruling in the protest of A.A. Beiro
Company,       Inc.,      1       P.O.   60    (D.C.     CAB    1987),    that   since    the
District       has     not        made   a    responsibility determination as              to
LaDorn and AC*JAN,                 Systems is not yet an aggrieved party and
the protest is premature and, therefore, does not come within
the Board's jurisdiction.
       The position of the District is well taken, although the
District has misconstrued the Board's holding in the protest
of A.A. Beiro Company. Inc.
       In past decisions this Board has held that in order for a
bidder to have a cognizable and viable protest such that the
Board will have jurisdiction, the bidder must be aggrieved in
connection       with         a     solicitation         or    contract    award.        This
holding    is        in   conformity           with      section   1-1189.3(1)      of    the
District of Columbia Procurement Practices Act of 1985,                                  D. C.
Code    (1987) and section 300.1, 27 DCMR 300.1 (Sept. 12, 1986),
of the Board's protest rules.                         A bidder is aggrieved when it
suffers    a    loss      or       injury or when a            legal     right   it has    is
violated by the act complained of.                            See Protest of A.A. Beiro
Company,   Inc.,          Protest of Emergency One, Inc., CAB No. P-114
(D.C. CAB November 2, 1988).

       While the District is correct in stating that a party
must be aggrieved in order to maintain a protest before this

      2 The District also argues in its Agency Report that the
Board lacks jurisdiction to consider protest regarding contract
performance.

Board, the District's interpretation of the point in time when
a bidder becomes aggrieved is misguided.                             The District cites
A.A.   Beiro      and     states       in    its   Agency     Report that" .                 . SPI
(Systems)        cannot    be     aggrieved          until     the       District          finally
determines        whether        of    not     the     apparent          low     bidders       are

responsible."            See     the    Agency       Report,        at    4.         The     Board

disagrees with the District's interpretation.                              In the protest
of Hood's Institutional Foods, D.C. CAB (January 25, 1989), the
Board elaborated on the issue of "aggrieved party".                                   In Hood,
the Board stated that the protester was correct in not filing a
protest     at    the     time    of    the     formal       bid    opening       because       no
official     action       adverse       to    it     had    been     taken      by    DAS,     and,
therefore,         the     protest           would     have        been        premature       and
speculative.        The Board stated:
       It was not until December 2, 1985, when the contract
       was awarded to Action, that Hood became aggrieved and
       its protest ripened.
       The mere submission of bids by allegedly nonresponsible
bidders did not have an injurious                          impact on Systems or any
other bidder.           At the time the protest was filed no official
action adverse           to Systems had been                taken.        Official action,
sufficient to cause Systems to be aggrieved,                              occurs when DAS
awards the contract to LaDorn and AC*JAN.                            until the contract
is awarded, there is still a possibility, no matter how remote,
that LaDorn and AC*JAN may not enter into the contract.                                      Prior
to the actual contract award, Systems' protest would still be

premature and speculative.

                                  -   5 -

         Systems has failed to show that it is an aggrieved party.
    Absent such action, this protest is premature and speculative.



    Therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear and decide this

    protest on the merits.
         Accordingly,   this   protest      is   dismissed   for   lack   of

    jurisdiction.
                                  ORDER

         This protest is dismissed.
