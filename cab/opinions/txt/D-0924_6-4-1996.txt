                                             OPINION

         In this appeal, the Appellant, MCI Constructors, Inc. ("MCI"), seeks convenience
  termination costs pursuant to the Board's previous entitlement decision in CAB No. D-835,
  reported at 39 D.C. Reg. 4305, which converted the District's default termination of MCl's
  contract into a termination for the convenience of the District. We conclude that MCI is entitled
  to recover $764,842, plus interest pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1188.6.

                                         BACKGROUND

         This case requires us to determine the appropriate award due MCI as a result of our
 entitlement decision which converted the District's improper default termination of Contract No.
 0477-AA-02-0-5-LA into a termination for the convenience of the District. The contract was
 for the construction of the Chlorination/Dechlorination Facility at the Blue Plains Wastewater
 Treatment Plan. It was a fixed-price contract in the amount of $2,882,850.00. 39 D.C. Reg.
 at 4305. The Project was designed to provide the final treatment of wastewater from the Blue
 Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant before the water is discharged into the Potomac River. MCI
 was required to build one new building largely for instrumentation; to furnish and install
 chlorination and sulfonation equipment, chemical piping, railroad spur tracks, process steam
 analyzers, and electrical power and control circuits; and to rehabilitate and repair existing
 chlorine injectors and chlorine injector water pumps. 39 D.C. Reg. at 4310; Appeal File ("AF")
 1, at SP-l.

         The entitlement decision sets forth the Board's findings of fact and conclusions of law
 supporting its decision to convert the termination for default into a termination for the
 convenience of the District. Neither party challenges our prior findings and we will not restate
 those findings except as necessary to explain our determinations with respect to quantum.

       In the entitlement decision, we directed the parties to resolve termination for convenience
quantum in accordance with Article 6 ("Termination for Convenience of the District") of the
General Provisions of the contract.· Pursuant to those directions, MCI submitted a termination

• Article 6 provides in pertinent part:

        E.       In the event of the failure of the Contractor and the Contracting Officer to agree .
        upon the whole amount to be paid to the Contractor by reason of the tennination of work pursuant
        this Article, the Contracting Officer shall, subject to any review required by the District's
        procedures in effect as of the date of execution of Contract, determine, on the basis of information
        available to him, the amount, if any, due the Contractor by reason of the termination and shall pay
        to the Contractor the amounts detennined by the Contracting Officer, as follows, but without
        duplication of any amounts agreed upon in accordance with D above.

           1.    With respect to all Contract work performed prior to the effective date of the Notice of

                          adjustment shall be made reducing the amount of the settlement to reflect the
                          indicated rate of loss; and provided further that profit shall be allowed only on
                          preparations made and work done by the Contractor for the terminated portion
                          of the Contract but may not be allowed on the Contractor's settlement expenses.
                          Anticipatory profits and consequential damages will not be allowed. Any
                          reasonable method may be used to arrive at a fair profit, separately or as part
                          of the whole settlement.

          2.     The reasonable cost of the preservation and protection of property incurred pursuant to

                 including expense incidental to the determination of the amount due to the Contractor as
                 the result of the tennination of work under the Contract.

        F.      The total sum to be paid to the Contractor under E 1. above shall not exceed the total
        Contract price as reduced by the amount of payments otherwise made and as further reduced by

 District and MCI to negotiate a termination for convenience settlement. From December 1991
 to June 1992, the District was dilatory in negotiating the termination claim with MCI. No
 meaningful negotiations took place and ultimately MCI filed the captioned appeal with the Board
 from the Director's deemed denial of MCl's termination cost claim. The parties conducted
 additional discovery on the issue of termination quantum, the Board conducted a six day
 quantum hearing in June 1993, and the parties submitted posthearing briefs.

         Under paragraph E of Article 6, the contractor whose contract has been terminated for
 convenience is entitled to recover its total costs incurred in performing the contract work
 (including changes to the contract work), the costs of settling claims arising out of the terminated
contract work, and a reasonable profit on the terminated work. Paragraph F of Article 6 caps
the contractor's recovery at the "total Contract price", minus payments previously received by
the contractor, and minus the contract price of any work not terminated. The phrase "total
Contract price" in Paragraph F, consistent with the phrase "Contract work" in Paragraph E,
means the total contract price as properly adjusted for inter alia contract changes. See A.A.
Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822, 40 D.C. Reg. 4574, 4626. Thus, a decision by the DAS
Director to terminate a contract for convenience (or, as here, a Board decision converting a
default termination to one for convenience) effectively converts a fixed-price contract into a cost
reimbursement contract, subject to the properly adjusted contract price as a ceiling. E.g.,
Worsham Constr. Co., ASBCA No. 25907, 85-2 BCA , 18,016 at 90,369.

          MCl's Revised Termination Claim Summary

        As set forth in its posthearing brief, MCI claims $1,828,018.36 in termination costs,
consisting of:

I.        Unpaid contract costs plus profit                         $1,029,130.52
          (limited to the contract cap)

II.       Jones & Artis (subcontractor) claim                            291,450.09

III.      Settlement expenses: "related legal expenses"                  180,016.00
                               "claim preparation costs"                 131,887.00

IV.       Interest (through 8/29/93)                                     195,534.75

        The District has challenged numerous elements of cost under each of the categories
identified by MCI. We will analyze the categories seriatim.

I.      Unpaid Contract Costs

        In determining MCl's total costs of performance under paragraph E.1.a of Article 6,
MCl's accounting experts, Messrs. Richard Watkins and Jerry Hahne of Watkins, Meegan,
Drury & Company, calculated that from inception of the contract to the date of termination,
MCI incurred $3,350,949.66 in total direct costs and $268,475.98 in allocable general and
administrative expenses. Pursuant to paragraph E.1.c of Article 6, the accountants added profit
of 12 percent, to arrive at a total project cost of $4,053,308.72 under Article 6, paragraph E.1.
Subtracting from that total the sum of all project payments MCI has previously received,
$2,802,716.48, the accountants concluded that MCl's total unpaid performance costs equal
$1,250,592.24. Recognizing that its total unpaid performance costs are subject to the adjusted
contract price cap of Article 6, paragraph F (recovery limited to the lesser of total unpaid
performance costs and the adjusted contract price cap), MCI calculates its adjusted contract price
as follows:

       Original Contract Amount                                             $2,882,850.00

       Plus:
       Change Order No. 1                                                        94,833.00
       Pending Change Orders                                                    199,443.00
       Delay Damages                                                            315,238.00
       Labor Inefficiency and Disruption                                        431,994.00

       Adjusted Contract Price                                              $3,924,358.00

MCI calculates the adjusted contract price cap pursuant to paragraph F of Article 6, as follows:

       Adjusted Contract Price                                              $3,924,358.00

       Less:
       Payments received                                                     2,802,716.48
       Value of uncompleted work                                                92.511.00

       Adjusted Contract Price Cap                                          $1,029,130.52

         Under its calculations, MCl's adjusted contract price cap ($1,029,130.52) is lower than
total unpaid performance costs ($1,250,592.24). Therefore, says MCI, this element of recovery
is limited to the amount of the adjusted contract price cap. However, the District challenges
MCl's inefficiency and disruption costs, the delay damages, and MCl's entitlement to costs for
instrumentation coordination. The parties' disputes in these areas affect the calculation of the
adjusted contract price, and, therefore, the calculation of the adjusted contract price cap.

        A. Orie;inaJ Contract Amount and Chane;e Order No.1

        The parties have stipulated to the original contract price of $2,882,850.00 and the amount
 of $94,833.00 for Change Order No. 1. (Joint Stipulations, filed June 21, 1993).

        B. "Pendinj.! Chall!le Orders"

         Under the "Pending Change Orders" category, the parties have stipulated to various
 change order amounts totaling $171,956 of the $199,443 claimed by MCI. (Second Joint
 Stipulations, filed June 21, 1993). The difference, $27,487, is based on MCl's claim for a
 constructive change arising from a District-caused redesign in some of the instrumentation.
 According to MCI's president, Mr. Clement Mitchell, District design errors forced him to assign
 a project engineer, Mr. Richard Fawley, to review and coordinate design changes between the
 District and one of MCl's instrumentation suppliers, Fischer & Porter. (6/21/93 Tr. 67). MCI
 seeks to recover 1,032 labor hours for coordination and revision work performed by Mr.
 Fawley, during the period March 1988 through September 1988, in connection with the
 instrumentation design change. We know from the record that the District in December 1987
 approved of the design changes sought by MCI. An undated MCI change proposal shows Mr.
 Fawley's labor rate at $22 per hour, multiplied by 1,032 hours, plus some unstated labor
 burden, for a total of $22,735. After applying some markup, the total claim is $27,487.
 (6/21/93 Tr. 70-72; MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 5). Although Mr. Fawley, as manager of MCl's
 construction planning and review department, had been involved with instrumentation submittals
 on the project at least as early as February 1987 (e.g., AF 4.11), he started working at the Blue
 Plains site beginning in March 1988. The evidence also shows, however, that he was doing
 more than simply coordination work associated with the instrumentation redesign on this one
project. Mr. Richard Vroom, MCl's project manager during the period September 1987 through
September 1988, testified that Mr. Fawley, as MCl's manager of document control, was
responsible for managing the submittal processes for all projects, including during the time
period when Mr. Fawley was physically located at Blue Plains from March through September
 1988. (6/23/93 Tr. 161-62). Based on our review of the relevant portions of the record, MCl's
initial action to assign Mr. Fawley's time to an overhead account was probably the correct one
since his time benefited more than one contract. We give little weight to the records submitted
by MCI in support of its change proposal for instrumentation coordination. (Cf. 6/21/93 Tr.
197; MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 3, Ex. B, Ex. 1 and Ex. 2-1 at 6; MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 5, Ex. 9, Ex.
1). Even if we were to treat Mr. Fawley's costs as direct costs, MCI has not attempted to
segregate the portion of his coordination time allocable to this contract and the portion allocable
to other contracts. In addition, MCI shares some of the responsibility for coordination problems
relating to the Fischer & Porter instrumentation (see, e.g., 6/21/93 Tr. 151-54; 6/23/93 Tr. 240-
41; District Exs. 56-57; AF 4, Attachments 4.22-4.24, 5.96), but it has not accounted for its
share of that responsibility. Accordingly, MCI is not entitled to an equitable adjustment for Mr.
Fawley's coordination work.

        c.   Labor Inefficiency and Disruption

         The law recognizes that an equitable adjustment may include as an element of recovery
 additional costs incurred by a contractor for loss of productivity or efficiency arising from
 disruptions for which the government bears cost responsibility. Like other types of claims, the
contractor must prove that it suffered a loss of efficiency and that the government or owner is
responsible for the loss of efficiency costs. U.S. Industries, Inc. v. Blake Constr. Co., 671 F.2d
539, 546-47 (D.C. Cir. 1982); Williams Enterprises v. Sherman R. Smoot Co., 938 F.2d 230,
236 (D.C. Cir. 1991). Unlike a delay claim, which seeks compensation for the additional costs
of having to stay on a project longer than it would have but for the delaying acts, a loss of
efficiency claim seeks compensation for the additional costs resulting from the government-
caused disruptions that made the contractor's work more difficult and expensive than it would
have absent the disruptions. U.S. Industries, 671 F.2d at 546. Courts and boards of contract
appeals have addressed a wide array of disrupting factors which may cause loss of productivity
or labor inefficiency, including factors such as: disruption of the contractor's work sequence,
disruptions from numerous contract changes creating delays and accelerations, disruptions
causing crowding or stacking of trades, disruptions or accelerations which force the contractor
to initiate overtime work, and government changes to one portion of a project which decrease
efficiency on another part of the project. See, e.g., U.S. Industries, 671 F.2d at 546-47;
William Enterprises, 938 F.2d at 236; Luria Brothers & Co. v. United States, 369 F.2d 701,
713-14 (Ct. Cl. 1967); Fischbach & Moore Int'l Corp., ASBCA No. 18146, 77-1 BCA 1
12,300, at 59,237-38; Continental Consolidated Corp., ASBCA No. 10662, 67-1 BCA ,6127;
Casson Constr. Co., GSBCA No. 4884, 83-1 BCA 1 16,523.

       The proper measure of the adjustment is the difference between what it would have cost
to perform the work without the government-caused disruption and what it actually cost to
perform the work with the disruption. General Railway Signal Co. v. WMATA, 875 F.2d 320,
325 (D.C. Cir. 1989); Williams Enterprises, 938 F.2d at 236. Having said that, it is well-
recognized that proof of quantum for labor inefficiency is often a difficult task. Luria Brothers,
369 F.2d at 713; Paccon, Inc., ASBCA No. 7890, 1963 BCA '3659, at 18,356.

        MCI claims that the District-caused delays, changes, and accelerations significantly
affected MCl's labor productivity and interrupted its rhythm and sequence of work. For
example, MCI claims that District delays arising from its poor design and project
mismanagement led to numerous contract changes which forced MCI repeatedly to shift its
workforce and resequence contract work and caused MCl's workforce to work excessive
overtime. MCI presented two methods for calculating its labor inefficiency and acceleration
costs, principally through the testimony of Mr. Edward Ripper of The Barrington ConSUlting
Group who was qualified as an expert in construction contract cost analysis and pricing.

       First, MCI relies on a modified total cost method to estimate its inefficiency costs. This
method compares actual costs with the bid estimate rather than with a would-have-cost estimate.
The inefficiency cost is equal to the actual cost of performing the affected work, minus costs

 incurred due to the contractor's fault, minus the contractor's bid price for the affected work.
 To use this method, the contractor must show that: (1) the actual inefficiency costs cannot be
 estimated reasonably by a more reliable means; (2) its estimate of the disrupted work is
 substantiated by its bid and the bid estimate is reasonable; (3) its actual costs are reasonable; and
 (4) government-caused disruption was responsible for the inefficiencies. See Servidone Constr.
 Corp. v. United States, 931 F.2d 860, 861 (Fed. Cir. 1991); WRB Corp. v. United States, 183
 Ct. Cl. 409, 426 (1968). In Servidone, the court approved of a modified total cost award in
 which the trial court substituted a reasonable bid amount for the original bid because of bid
 inaccuracies. 931 F.2d at 861-62.

        MCI states that it incurred total labor costs of $952,808. This amount was derived from
 MCl's job cost recap which showed total labor costs of $912,365.55. The job cost amount was
adjusted upward by $17,707.45, to account for adjustments arising from MCl's change to new
accounting system software, plus $22,735 for the coordination work of Mr. Fawley. (6/21193
Tr. 196-98; MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 3, Ex. B, Tab 1). From the total labor costs of $952,808, Mr.
Ripper subtracted labor costs of $18,055 for pipe dope rework attributable to MCI, and total
labor supervision and administration costs of $306,535, in order to obtain "adjusted manual labor
costs" of $628,218. (6/24/93 Tr. 102; MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 6, at 2). From the adjusted manual
labor cost total, he subtracted the budgeted (bid) manual labor costs of $197,374, labor in
approved change orders of $18,096, and labor included in unapproved change orders claimed
elsewhere of $74,344, for a total manual labor loss of $338,404. To this amount, he added
labor supervision costs of $47,305 and 12 percent profit for a total labor inefficiency and
acceleration claim of $431,994.

         MCI also presented an alternative set of calculations which it calls a "measured mile"
 analysis. The measured mile method (also variously called "yardstick" or "benchmark") is one
 form of a would-have-cost analysis where the productivity that the contractor achieved in an
 undisrupted work period is compared to the contractor's productivity on identical or similar tasks
during a disrupted work period. See U.S. Industries, 671 F.2d at 547; 2 R. NASH & 1. CIBINIC,
FEDERAL PROCUREMENT LAW 1412-13 (3d ed. 1980). As a generalization, the difference in
productivity or labor costs between the disrupted and undisrupted periods represents the loss of
productivity or efficiency costs. The more comparable the project conditions during the two
periods (other than the disruption), the more persuasive the analysis. Mr. Ripper testified that
he performed a measured mile productivity analysis of MCl's labor inefficiencies in order to
verify that the amount calculated under the modified total cost approach was reasonable.
(6124/93 Tr. 122; MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 6, at 8). Focusing on MCl's civil and mechanical
activities, Mr. Ripper used MCl's payment requisitions as an indication of the progress that was
being made on a monthly basis on the project. (6124/93 Tr. 123). Mr. Ripper determined that
there was no unimpacted performance period with regard to those activities. He analyzed the
period from October 1, 1986 through December 20, 1987 and determined that this period was
a "moderately" impacted period. He determined the period from December 21, 1987 through
September 30, 1988 to be a "severely" impacted period. He concluded that during the
moderately impacted period, MCI labor was 25 percent inefficient due to District-caused

 disruptions. (6/24/93 Tr. 128-29). For the moderately impacted period, Mr. Ripper calculated
 the number of manhours spent to accomplish one percentage of completion for civil activities
 (90.45) and for mechanical activities (30.07) by dividing the total actual manhours for the civil
 activities (7,966) and mechanical activities (1,617) by the percentages of civil (88.08%) and
 mechanical (53.77%) work completed. Then, he reduced the manhours per percent complete
 by 25 percent to derive a "should have been" manhours per percent complete for civil (67.83)
 and mechanical (22.55). Finally, he multiplied the "should have been" manhours per percent
 complete by the actual percentages completed for the moderately and severely impacted periods
 to arrive at the number of manhours Mel should have been required to spend to accomplish the
 civil (5,975) and mechanical (1,213) work in the moderately impacted period. Under Mr.
 Ripper's method, the difference between the "should have been" manhours and the actual
 manhours constitutes the inefficient manhours spent on civil (1,992) and mechanical (404) in the
 moderately impacted period. To determine the number of inefficient manhours spent in the
severely impacted period, Mr. Ripper calculated from the project's payment requisitions the
percentages of completion accomplished for civil (9.35 %) and mechanical (44.69 %) work during
the severely impacted period. Using the "should have been" manhours per percent complete for
civil and mechanical, he arrived at total inefficient labor hours for civil (1,551) and mechanical
(5,638) work for the severely impacted period. MUltiplying the total number of inefficient labor
hours (9,585) times an hourly manual labor rate ($26.79) yields a manual labor inefficiency and
acceleration cost of $256,778. Adding labor supervision and administration ($47,305) and 12
percent profit yields a final total of $340,573. (6/24/93 Tr. 103-04, 125-32, 147-48, 159-60).
Mel also presented, at the Board's request, an alternative analysis which used the bid, rather
than the moderately impacted period as adjusted, to calculate a baseline manhours per percent
complete rate for the civil activities (42.7 manhours per percent complete) and the mechanical
activities (45.2 manhours per percent complete). Using these baseline rates, the total labor
acceleration and inefficiencies amount is $347, 188. (ld.).

        The District does not dispute that Mel experienced significant inefficiencies (6/29/93 Tr.
255) but claims that the inefficiencies were the resu~t of Mel's own poor execution and
coordination of the work rather than the result of District-caused disruptions. The District
contends that Mel failed to adduce specific proof that any District changes or disruptions caused
Mel to experience inefficiencies. Also, the District claims that Mel underbid the project in a
number of areas but because the original bid papers cannot be located the District states that it
cannot determine whether cost overruns are the result of bid errors or Mel inefficiencies. The
District's Mr. John Livengood, qualified as an expert in construction claim analysis, did not
believe that Mel's measured mile analysis using percentage of completion data from payment
requisitions was appropriate under the circumstances. Mr. Livengood testified that there is no
support for Mel's deduction of 25 percent from the manhours per percent complete rate for the
"moderately impacted period" in order to arrive at a baseline manhour per percent complete rate
for the civil and mechanical activities. Moreover, the District argues that Mel never established
a causal link between District-caused disruptions or delays and particular Mel labor activities
as a necessary predicate for showing District-caused labor inefficiencies.

          Under the particular facts of this case, we conclude that neither method used by Mel to
 estimate inefficiency quantum provides a sufficiently reliable measure of Mel's inefficiency
 costs arising from District-caused disruptions. Our conclusion on the inadequacy of proof of
 quantum originates in Mel's overly general proof of causation. The evidence does not convince
 us that the various District disruptions caused labor overruns in the labor activities covered by
 Mel's modified total cost or measured mile analyses. In a number of areas, Mel's presentation
 suffered from a lack of reasonable detail as to (1) the work activities which were disrupted and
 rendered inefficient, and (2) the causal connection between the District's disruptions and Mel's
 increased labor costs. Mel's presentation on causation -- often no more than general statements
 that it suffered inefficiencies resulting from out of sequence work, work delays and suspensions,
and accelerations -- failed to reasonably specify what work activities were rendered inefficient
and how the disruptions made those activities more difficult and expensive. For example, Mel
did not explain why, according to its job cost records, some activities were performed below
budget while others greatly exceeded budget. Mel did not explain the 30-fold increase in labor
for installing seed and fertilizer (labor code 601) and the nearly 150-fold increase in the "piping-
exc. bed & refill" work (labor code 603) under the civil work, and the 10-fold increase in labor
for installing the stainless steel pipe (labor code 204) and the 50-fold increase for installing
diffusers (labor category 230) under the mechanical work. (Mel Vol. 2, Exhibit 3, Ex. B, Ex.
1; District Ex. 5, Attachment 5-12, at 1-4; District Ex. 130). Because the level of analysis and
proof was much too general, we are unable to conclude that either Mel's modified total cost
method, addressing a single adjusted total manual labor cost, or Mel's measured mile method,
addressing Mel labor costs under composite civil and mechanical categories, provides a
reasonable measure of Mel inefficiency costs for which the District bears cost responsibility.

        There are additional reasons why we cannot adopt either Mel method for measuring
 quantum. For its modified total cost approach, Mel did not persuade us that its bid, as
generally reflected in the project's initial budget document which summarizes labor and non-
labor bid estimates (District Ex. 130; see 6121193 Tr. 52), provides a reliable estimate of labor
for Mel to perform the contract work excluding the disruptions, changes, and accelerations for
which the District bears cost responsibility. Other than the totals for each labor code, the budget
summary contains no information relating to the labor estimates. It contains no supporting
documentation speaking to productivity assumptions. Because the underlying bid worksheets are
missing (6121/93 Tr. 115, 117), more persuasive evidence could have been presented in the form
of an independent would-have-cost estimate. Having carefully reviewed the record, we are
convinced that there were some bidding errors by Mel, as reflected in the budget summary
document, that had the effect of understating the estimated labor costs. Mel did not
persuasively address those errors in its case or make adjustments accordingly. In fact, Mel
makes an adjustment only for the pipe dope rework performed by Mel in the June and July 1988
period. As discussed earlier, the evidence shows that Mel also bears some responsibility for
coordination problems that existed on the project. (See, e.g., 6121/93 Tr. 151-54; 6123/93 Tr.
240-41; District Exs. 56-57; AF 4, Attachments 4.22-4.24,5.96). Although those coordination
problems did not translate into critical path delay (see infra), they affected Mel's labor
efficiency and its labor supervision costs.

        Mel presented its measured mile analysis "to check and verify that the amount calculated
under the modified total cost approach was reasonable and accurate." However, we fail to see
how the results of that analysis verify the modified total cost result. In addition, we do not have
confidence in the reliability of the baseline productivity rates calculated for the composite civil
and mechanical activities. The problem of reliability does not arise primarily from the expert's
use of a composite civil and mechanical percentage of completion approach derived from the
payment requisition records, a measurement standard Mel's Mr. Ripper readily agreed was less
preferred than having actual data on quantities of materials installed. (6/24/93 Tr. 122-23, 161-
62). Rather, we do not believe the record provides adequate evidence to justify the calculated
baseline productivity rates for the civil and mechanical categories against which the moderately
and severely impacted periods were assessed. Specifically, we cannot find adequate evidence
in the record to support the 25 percent deductive adjustment which Mr. Ripper made to the
manhours per percent complete rate for the moderately impacted period in order to arrive at the
baseline rate. He arrived at the 25 percent adjustment based on discussions with Mel's
president and personnel concerning "impacts that were occurring on the job, ,,2 from "studying
the fluctuations on a monthly basis, ,,3 and from his experience in having performed a "great
many productivity calculations" in "various environments" under "various levels of impact."
(6/24/93 Tr. 128-29). Mr. Ripper is not a construction engineer and did not offer an
engineering estimate. None of Mel's fact witnesses offered a meaningful estimate. Nor do the
baseline mechanical and civil rates (22.55 and 67.83, respectively) compare in any logical
manner with the manhours per percent complete rates that Mr. Ripper calculated for the
mechanical and civil portions (45.2 and 42.7, respectively) of Mel's bid as reflected in the




2 MCl's president testified that in the latter part of 1987 he and others at MCI made a review of project status and
costs and "it was our opinion at the time we were running an inefficiency factor of between 20 and 30 percent."
(6/21/93 Tr. 60-61). Although he testified that the inefficiency was caused by certain delays and contract changes,
the explanation was superficial and lacked any substantiating evidence for quantifying the inefficiency. (!d. at 61-
63). These general observations do not adequately establish a reliable basis for Mr. Ripper's use of a 25 percent
adjustment to the "moderately impacted period" manhour per percent complete rates in order to arrive at baseline
rates. Mr. Vroom, the MCI project manager for this project and another ongoing project at Blue Plains, testified
that when he joined the project in September 1987, he reviewed actual labor and material costs incurred to date,
compared those costs with percentage completion, and made a cost to complete analysis for his management.
(6/23/93 Tr. 139-142). To the extent that Mr. Vroom testified that as of September 1987 MCI's labor costs
exceeded budget by 20 to 30 percent because of District "delay", we give little weight to such testimony because
he admittedly had little or no knowledge about the job when he came aboard and he gives no reasons supporting
his conclusion. (Cf id. at 140-142 and 256-59). While the 20 to 30 percent figure may well represent MCl's labor
overrun on the project at that time, neither the testimony from Mr. Mitchell nor from Mr. Vroom convinces us that
those numbers represent MCI labor inefficiency solely attributable to the District.

3  Although the record is unclear, the "fluctuations" appear to refer to monthly fluctuations in the manhours per
percent complete. Because MCl's documentation did not permit Mr. Ripper to calculate quantities of materials
installed, or the like, we must presume that Mr. Ripper never studied fluctuations in the productivity for actual
project activities.

    budget summary.4

             Notwithstanding that we cannot rely on the modified total cost or measured mile analysis
     presented by MCI, the record convinces us that the District's disruptions, delays, and
     accelerations caused MCI to incur inefficiency and acceleration costs for which the District bears
     cost responsibility. The District concedes that MCI is entitled to some compensation for the
     acceleration which began in May 1988. Well before December 1987, MCI had to contend with
     numerous significant disruptions caused by the District's failure to drain the forebays, untimely
    approval of the Fischer & Porter chlorination/dechlorination equipment submittals, and untimely
    action on the console redesign. The District's untimely actions and the design problems
    regarding the chlorine water injection pumps and the stop logs problem also disrupted MCI
    operations. The District also imposed constructive and directed accelerations to MCl's work.
    (6/23/93 Tr. 111-117). The changes forced MCI to resequence work not only in 1987 but also
    in 1988 when the District was demanding that MCI get the facility operational to meet an EPA
    deadline. The District does not dispute that MCI resequenced work or incurred acceleration
    costs. The District's expert testified, and his exhibits show, that MCI accelerated performance
    in varying degrees from the beginning of May 1988 through at least July 1988. (District Ex.
    5, Attachment 5-6).

        Owing to the difficulty here in substantiating with direct and specific proof the quantum
for each labor activity or group of activities subjected to inefficiency and acceleration, our use
of a "jury verdict" method for estimating the inefficiency and acceleration costs is appropriate.
Nolan Brothers, Inc. v. United States, 437 F.2d 1371, 1387-88 (Ct. Cl. 1971); Joseph Pickard's
Sons Co. v. United States, 532 F.2d 739, 742 (Ct. Cl. 1976); Fischbach & Moore, 77-1 BCA
, 12,300, at 59,237. In making a "jury verdict" determination, we have reviewed the scope and
types of District-caused changes and disruptions, the estimated labor hours and costs, and the
actual labor hours and costs for each job activity code under equipment and piping installation
(labor code series 100 and 200) and civil installation (labor code series 600). Based on our
review, we conclude that MCI is entitled to a total of $180,000 for direct labor inefficiencies
and acceleration for which the District bears cost responsibility. We add ten percent for
supervision and administration, reSUlting in a subtotal of $198,000.

        The parties dispute the proper profit rate that should be applied to the contract
adjustments pursuant to paragraph E.1.c of the Article 6 termination for convenience clause.
In its original termination for convenience proposal, MCl's accounting expert, Mr. Watkins,
used a 10 percent profit rate on MCI costs with regard to the labor inefficiencies and
acceleration claim (MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 3, Ex. D), but used a 12 percent profit rate elsewhere
(id., Ex. B). A 10 percent profit rate was used in Change Order No. 1, the only bilateral
change order executed by the parties. (See A.F. 5. 1 at 5-2). MCl's budget summary identifies


4  Using composite rates derived from the budget summary of the bid would not be a proper measure here because
the result would effectively duplicate the modified total cost method, excluding only the labor activities not included
in the civil and mechanical composites. (6/24/93 Tr. 153).

projected income at approximately 9.5 percent of total budgeted costs. (District Ex. 130, at 7).
Mr. Ripper determined that a 12 percent profit rate was justified by MCl's profit history on
other jobs. Mr. Mitchell, MCl's president, also testified in support of a 12 percent rate. MCI,
therefore, applies a 12 percent profit rate in its current quantum request. Based on our review
of the record, including the 10 percent rate used in Change Order No.1, we find that a profit
rate of 10 percent is reasonable and should be applied. Adding ten percent profit to the labor
inefficiency and acceleration subtotal of $198,000, yields a final total of $217,800 for MCl's
labor inefficiencies and acceleration costs.

        D. Delay Damaees

        MCI seeks a total of $315,238 in delay damages, consisting of extended labor supervision
and administration amounting to $107,877, unabsorbed or extended home office overhead
amounting to $127,702, and costs for extended equipment and general conditions equal to
$79,659. For the most part, MCl's calculation of delay damages relies on its determination that
the District caused a 252-day critical path delay to project completion and that MCI was not
responsible for any concurrent critical path delay. The District contends that MCI was
responsible for significant concurrent delays and is entitled to compensation for at most 62 days
of District-caused delay. Because MCI seeks compensation for costs its says it incurred on
account of project delays, we need to determine the magnitude of the compensable delay period.
We will address that issue under the claim for extended home office overhead before we reach
the claims for costs associated with extended labor supervision and administration and extended
equipment and general conditions.

               1. Unabsorbed Home Office Overhead

        Overhead refers to indirect costs that a contractor must expend for the benefit of the
business as a whole, as opposed to direct costs which are costs specifically identified with a final
cost objective such as a contract. A contractor typically incurs the majority of its overhead costs
operating a home office. Because overhead costs are generally fixed, and time-related, a
contractor continues to incur them even during periods of reduced contract activity caused by
a delay or suspension. When contract performance is delayed by the government in such a
manner that the contractor cannot absorb a fair share of its on-going overhead costs, the law
allows the contractor to recover its unabsorbed or extended overhead costs as an element of
delay damages. Eichleay Corp., ASBCA No. 5183, 60-2 BCA 12688, aff'd on recon., 61-1

formula used in Eichleay for quantifying the amount of recoverable unabsorbed home office
overhead for a construction contractor consists of the following three calculations:

To the extent that the contractor has recovered some part of the unabsorbed overhead during the
delay period (e.g., a markup for fixed overhead on direct costs for change order work), it must
be deducted from the amount of recoverable overhead calculated under the Eichleay formula.

         To justify use of the Eichleay formula for calculating a daily rate for unabsorbed home
office overhead expenses, the contractor must show that: (1) the government has caused a
compensable delay or suspension; (2) the delay or suspension interrupts or reduces the stream
of income from payments for contract direct costs; and (3) it was unable to absorb a fair share
of its home office overhead costs during the delay or suspension period. George Hyman, 816
F.2d at 756-57; Wickham Contractin.g, 12 F.3d at 1577-78. If the contractor shows that the
delay or suspension was sudden and of unpredictable duration, it makes a prima facie showing
that it was unable to absorb a fair share of its home office overhead expenses because in those
circumstances it is presumed that it was not prudent or practical for the contractor to mitigate
the impact by reducing overhead costs (e.g., by reducing home office personnel, facilities, or
other fixed costs of running the business) or by taking on new work. George Hyman, 816 F.2d
at 757; Williams Enterprises, 938 F.2d at 235; Mech-Con Corp. v. West, 61 F.3d 883, 886-87
(Fed. Cir. 1995); Wickham Contracting, 12 F.3d at 1577-78. The government may rebut the
presumption by showing that the contractor "did not suffer or should not have suffered any loss
because it was able to either reduce its overhead or take on other work during the delay."
Mech-Con, 61 F.3d at 886.

        MCl's claim for $127,702 in extended or unabsorbed home office overhead costs consists
of $86,963 for a 252-day delay during contract performance and $40,739 for a WI-day pre-
performance delay by the District in issuing the notice to proceed. The District contends that
the WI-day pre-performance delay is not compensable and that MCl concurrently delayed the
project's critical path and therefore is entitled to no more than $21,397 based on a 62-day non-

        The 252-day performance delay claim

       Notice to Proceed was issued to Melon July 21, 1986. 39 D.e. Reg. at 4305.
Construction of the project was to be completed 550 consecutive calendar days after Notice to
Proceed, i.e., on or before January 21, 1988. (Id.). MCI claims that it is entitled to
compensation for 252 days of delay measured from the original completion date, January 21,
1988, through the date its contract was improperly default terminated, September 30, 1988.
MCI takes the position that because the Board in its entitlement decision found that the 252-day
delay period was caused by District acts or omissions, and did not make any findings that Mel
had caused concurrent delay, it has made out a prima facie case that the 252-day delay period
was not only excusable but also fully compensable. Mel witnesses testified at the quantum
hearing that Mel did not concurrently delay critical path activities.

        The District claims that MCI was responsible for concurrent delays through July 29,
1988, and therefore is only entitled to compensation for the 62 days of delay from July 30, 1988
through September 30, 1988. The District contends that the Board in its entitlement decision
did not find that the 252-day delay period was compensable but rather was merely excusable.
The District has stated that it is not challenging the findings of fact made by the Board in its
entitlement decision. Rather, it says that the issue of whether there were any concurrent delays
caused by Mel was not before the Board in the entitlement phase and was not resolved in the
entitlement decision. An expert witness for the District testified at the quantum hearing that
Mel was responsible for approximately 190 days of concurrent critical path delay to project
completion.

        We begin our analysis by reviewing our underlying entitlement decision on the issue of
delay. In that decision, the Board found that the District had significantly delayed the
completion of the project, based primarily on three grounds: (1) the District's failure to drain
the six forebay containment areas in order to allow Mel to perform its piping work in the
forebays; (2) the District's failure to timely approve submittals for the instrumentation equipment
and the failure to timely resolve deficiencies in the District's design of the instrumentation panel;
and (3) the District's failure to respond timely to MCl's proposal for rehabilitation of the
chlorine injection water pumps and the District's failure to resolve its defective design for
rehabilitating the pumps. The District correctly argues that the Board in its entitlement decision
did not make any express finding that the 252-day delay period was compensable delay. The
Board did find that the delay was excusable on Mel's part. It is in this quantum phase of the
case that the parties have focused on the issue of whether Mel caused concurrent critical path
delays. Nevertheless, the Board in the entitlement decision did find that the District was
responsible for: (1) a 149-day critical path delay from October 1987 to March 1988 because of
the forebay problems; (2) an approximate six and one half month critical delay between October
1987 and May 2, 1988 based on the District's failure to timely approve Mel's proposal for
rehabilitating the pumps; and (3) a critical delay to completion -- measured up to September 30,
1988, the termination date, caused by the District's failure to resolve its defective design for the

             Given the District's stipulation on the record that it is not challenging the findings made
    by the Board in the entitlement decision, we will not reexamine our prior findings with regard
    to the District-caused critical path delays. If we find that MCI cannot be charged with any
    concurrent critical path delay, then the record requires us to hold that MCI is entitled to recover
    its delay costs for a period of 252 days. To determine the issue of concurrency we must
    examine whether MCI is responsible for delays in the prosecution of its work and whether any
    such delays caused a concurrent critical path delay to project completion. 6 The District bears
    the burden of proving concurrency because it is in the nature of an affirmative defense to
    liability for delay damages. See Willi(J.lT',s Enterprises v. Strait Mfg. & Welding, Inc., 728 F.
    Supp. 12, 16 (D.D.C. 1990), aff'd sub nom. Williams Enterprises v. Sherman R. Smoot Co.,
    938 F.2d 230 (D.C. Cir. 1991). As in the case of demonstrating compensable delay, the party
    asserting a concurrent delay must show that the delay affects the critical path of performance.
    See Blackhawk Heating & Plumbing Co., GSBCA No. 2432, 76-1 BCA , 11,649 at 55,579;
    Fischbach & Moore Int'l Corp., ASBCA No. 18146, 77-1 BCA 1 12,300 at 59,224.

        The District argues that it established concurrent critical path delays caused by MCI in
(1) delivering the built-up roofing system, (2) fabricating and delivering the monitor and control
console, and (3) fabricating, delivering, and installing the chlorinators, sulfonators, evaporators,
and associated valves, piping, and fittings. According to the District, MCI-caused delays and
District-caused delays were concurrent through July 29, 1988, and that the only period of non-
concurrent District-caused delay was the period July 30, 1988 through the termination date of
September 30, 1988, a total of 62 calendar days.

         The District contends that MCI delayed the roofing installation of Chlorine Building No.
2 by failing to enter timely into a subcontract with the roofing subcontractor, by submitting late
and incomplete roofing submittals, and by failing to timely install both the lightweight concrete
roof topping over the precast concrete roof deck and the built-up roofing system. Placement of
the lightweight concrete roof topping had to precede installation of the built-up roofing. MCI
completed placing the concrete topping on August 26, 1987. MCl's subcontractor began
installing the built-up roofing system on October 13, 1987, and finished on October 20, 1987.
The District's scheduling expert concluded that MCI had delayed roofing installation by 146
calendar days (May - September 1987). MCI does not dispute that the roofing work was
completed later than originally scheduled. It argues that installing the roofing system simply did



5   The other District-caused delays identified by the Board in its entitlement decision, particularly the delays
associated with untimely approval of the instrumentation equipment and resolution of the design deficiencies, were
in the nature of concurrent District delays subsumed by the critical delays caused by the District's problems with
the forebays and chlorine injector water pumps.

6  The parties have taken the same approach in presenting their quantum cases to the Board. (District Ex. 5, at 2-3
to 2-4; 6/28/93 Tr. 176-77).

not delay the project in any manner. Once the lightweight concrete topping was placed, the
building was in the dry and Mel could have proceeded with the instrumentation work in the
building notwithstanding that the built-up roofing had not yet been installed. (6/23/93 Tr. 134).
Mel was not able to proceed with the instrumentation work in the building because the District
did not approve the chlorination and sulfonation equipment until December 1987. The late
completion of the built-up roofing did not delay any follow-on activities and had no effect on
the project's critical path. (6/24/93 Tr. 23-24). Because the District did not approve the
instrumentation package until December 1987, there was no reason for Mel to complete the
built-up roofing any earlier than October 1987. Based on the evidence, we agree with Mel that
the roofing-related activities were not a source of Mel-caused concurrent critical path delay.

         The District contends that Mel concurrently delayed project completion by delaying the
 installation of required instrumentation, including the chlorine control panel, the dechlorination
control panel, the monitor control panel, and the chlorinators, sulfonators, and related items. 7
The District concludes that Mel is responsible for critical delays to the monitor and control
panels because Mel submitted late and incomplete submittals and failed to originally schedule
time for the fabrication and delivery. The monitor and control panels were delivered to the
project site by June 9, 1988, and were installed by June 10, 1988. Adjusting for 75 days of its
own submittal review delay, the District states that Mel caused a net delay of 318 calendar days
(May 5, 1987 to March 26, 1988) which is concurrent with the District-caused delays to the
chlorine injector water pumps, the forebays, and the instrumentation. (6/28/93 Tr. 282-84). The
District also charges Mel with concurrent delay caused by Mel's late installation of the
chlorinators, sulfonators, and related equipment, valves, fittings, and accessories. According
to the District, the root causes for the delays were late and incomplete submittals by Mel's
subcontractor, Fischer & Porter; Mel's failure to originally schedule time for fabrication and
delivery of the chlorinators and sulfonators; evidence of performance delays and deficiencies by
Fischer & Porter; and coordination problems between Mel and Fischer & Porter. The District's
scheduling expert testified that Mel delayed the installation of the chlorinators, sulfonators, and
related items by 471 calendar days (April 15, 1987 through July 29, 1988). (District Ex. 5, AU.
4-10; 6/29/93 Tr. 38-39). According to this expert, these delays translated into a 290-day
overall delay to Mel's work between October 13, 1987 and July 29, 1988. (6/29/93 Tr. 40).
The expert identified two components of the 290-day delay, a period of 253 days covering the
time between October 13, 1987 (the expert's adjusted late finish date when the work should have
been completed) and June 23, 1988 (the date the piping was actually installed) and a period of
37 days between June 23, 1988 and July 29, 1988 where Mel performed the pipe dope rework.

7 The chlorinators are devices that measure the flow of chlorine gas to an injector where the gas is mixed with
water. The chlorinators measure the appropriate amount of chlorine gas to mix with the wastewater in order to
disinfect the water prior to discharge into the Potomac River. The sulfonators perform a function analogous to the
chlorinators except that they feed a measured amount of sulfur dioxide gas to the injectors. (6/28/93 Tr. 13-14,
22).

         We find that MCI should not be charged with concurrent delay arising from the
 fabrication, delivery, and installation of the instrumentation. First, the District bore a significant
 responsibility for the delays up to December 1987 in instrumentation by failing to respond to
 submittals in a timely manner, improperly rejecting Fischer & Porter's equipment, and failing
 to respond to District design deficiencies and MCI requests for information. 39 D.C. Reg.
4312-13. To the extent that some contractor submittals were submitted after the due dates
shown in the as-planned schedule, through no fault of the District, we are not persuaded that this
caused any critical path delay. Beginning two months before the December 17, 1987 meeting
(in which the District finally approved of the Fischer & Porter instrumentation and resolved
various outstanding instrumentation design issues), and extending well into 1988, the District
was causing critical delays to project completion as a result of its failure to drain the forebays
and its failure to respond to MCl's chlorine injector water pump rehabilitation proposal. And
even after the chlorine injector water pumps were installed at the site on May 2, 1988, testing
showed that the pumps failed to create sufficient system pressure because of the District's
defective rehabilitation design. The pumps' performance failure was the primary reason why
the plant was not operational at the time of termination in September 1988. 39 D.C. Reg. at
4314.

        We agree with MCI that the delays attributed to MCI by the District were not critical
path delays and generally come within the category of "why hurry up and wait." See J.
Wickwire, et ai., Critical Path Method Techniques in Contract Claims: Issues and
Developments, 1974 to 1988, 18 PUB. CONTRACT L.J. 338, 381 (1989). "[W]here the
government causes delays to the critical path, it is permissible for the contractor to relax its
performance of its work to the extent that it does not impact project completion. Id.; see Utley-

James, Inc., GSBCA No. 5370, 85-1 BCA , 17,816 at 89,109, aff'd, Utley-James, Inc. v.
United States, 14 Cl. Ct. 804 (1988). Although it is clear that MCI completed roofing later than
the date called for in the as-planned schedule, and it is true that MCI was having difficulty
prodding Fischer & Porter in early 1988 to complete its delivery of instrumentation, we conclude
that those delays simply did not affect project completion in view of the overriding District-
caused critical path delays.

       The 101-day notice to proceed delay claim

         MCI claims that it is entitled to recover extended home office overhead costs for an
additional 101-day delay because the District unreasonably delayed issuing notice to proceed on
the project. MCI added this claim shortly before the quantum hearing commenced and well after
it submitted its termination proposal to the contracting officer. Bids were opened on September
9, 1985, and MCI was the lowest bidder. 39 D.C. Reg. at 4305. MCI received notice of award
of the project on March 10, 1986. The performance and payment bonds bear an execution date
of June 3, 1986. The construction contract between the District and Mel bears the same
execution date, June 3, 1986. Notice to Proceed was issued to MCI on July 15, 1986, directing
Mel to commence construction on July 21, 1986. MCl's president, Mr. Clement Mitchell,
testified that in his experience on other contracts, a notice to proceed would issue 5 to 10 days,

but no more than 30 days, after notice of award. MCI calculated the WI-day delay period by
deducting 30 days from the 131 days between notice of award and notice to proceed. (6/21/93
Tr. 57-59). The District responds that MCI has failed to demonstrate that its home office
overhead was underabsorbed during the WI-day period and that the District was responsible for
MCI not receiving the notice to proceed earlier than July 21, 1986.

        We agree with the District that MCI has failed to establish its right to recover extended
home office overhead costs for any portion of the 101 days between receipt of notice of award
and notice to proceed. Mr. Mitchell's testimony, coupled with the timing of the notice of
award, the execution of the bonds and contract, and the notice to proceed, do not persuade us
that the District breached its implied duty to issue its notice to proceed in a reasonable period
of time.

       Recoverable overhead

        In sum, 252 days of delay caused by the District are compensable to the extent that MCI
can meet the other requirements for establishing its right to recover using the EichZeay formula.
Here, the record demonstrates, and the District does not seriously dispute, that the other
requirements are met. The District-caused delays arising from the forebay, instrumentation, and
chlorine injector water pump problems interrupted MCl's prosecution of the work and reduced
the stream of income on the project. The delays were sudden and of unpredictable duration.
In addition, the District's constructive and directed acceleration orders also made it even less
prudent or practical for MCI to reduce home office overhead costs or to take on new work
during the course of the substantial delays.

       MCI and the District agree that contract billings during performance of the project were
$3,029,506, MCl's total company-wide billings during the performance period were
$39,922,455, and MCl's total corporate overhead during the performance period was
$3,647,386. Using the first equation of the Eichleay formula, corporate overhead allocable to
the contract equals $276,781. Dividing the allocable overhead by the total contract period of
802 days yields allocable overhead at a daily rate of $345.11. Multiplying the daily rate by the
252 days of compensable delay results in recoverable unabsorbed home office overhead of
$86,968.

        From this amount we must deduct home office overhead amounts MCI has recovered
under other equitable adjustments to the contract. The parties have not identified what portion
of the $94,833 adjustment resulting from Change Order No.1 and the $171,956 stipulated
adjustment for the "pending" change orders represents a mark-up for home office overhead.
Based on the record presented here, we make a jury verdict finding that a deduction of two
percent of the total adjustments, amounting to $5,336, is proper. Accordingly, MCI is entitled
to $81,632 for unabsorbed home office overhead, to which we add ten percent profit for a final
total of $89,795.

                2. Extended Labor Supervision and Administration

         Additional labor supervision and administration costs, incurred by a contractor by virtue
 of having to perform contract work for an additional duration beyond what it would have had
 to perform but for delay and disruption for which the government bears cost responsibility, are
 recoverable like other delay or disruption damages in order to make the contractor whole.
 Williams Enterprises v. Strait Mfg. & Welding, 728 F. Supp. at 19-20. Like home office
 overhead, some field office costs are fixed and time-related, and the contractor continues to
 incur such costs during periods of reduced contract activity caused by delay or suspension.
 George Hyman Constr. Co., ENG BCA No. 4541, 85-1 BCA 1 17,847 at 89,353. Construction
 contractors may carry field office costs, such as project supervision and administration, as direct
 costs to the job where the costs are specifically identifiable with that one project. See Wickham
 Contracting, 12 F.3d at 1581; B.D. Collins Constr. Co., ASBCA No. 42662, 92-1 BCA 1
24,659. In a compensable delay situation where project supervision and administration are
carried as direct costs, an equitable adjustment for extended field supervision and administration
is calculated as a direct cost item. Field overhead which is charged, for example, to a G&A
expense pool as indirect costs should not be commingled in the direct cost calculation. See,
e.g., Santa Fe Engineers, Inc., ASBCA No. 31762,91-1 BCA '23,571 at 118,195. Where it
is impracticable to derive actual cost data during the delay period, one recognized measure of
the direct costs for extended labor supervision and administration is to compute a daily rate by
dividing total labor supervision and administration costs on the project by the total days of
contract performance and then multiplying the result by the number of days of compensable
delay. Santa Fe Engineers, Inc., 91-1 BCA 123,571 at 118,195-96; George Hyman Constr.
Co., 85-1 BCA 1 17,847 at 89,353. To the extent that the contractor already has recovered
some field supervision costs during the delay period as part of another equitable adjustment
under the contract, those amounts must be deducted from the amount of recoverable extended
field supervision costs. George Hyman Constr. Co., 85~1 BCA 1 17,847 at 89,353.

        MCI claims that it is entitled to extended labor supervision and administration costs for
the 252-day delay period. MCI states that it incurred a total of $306,535 in labor supervision
and administration costs on the project. With a total contract period, as extended, of 802 days,
Mel calculated a daily labor supervision and administration rate of $382.22. Multiplying the
daily rate times the 252 days constituting the delay period yields $96,319, to which MCI adds
12 percent profit in arriving at a total claim of $107,877. The District argues that MCI
significantly underbid its labor supervision and administration costs and that overruns in these
cost categories were not due to District actions. Using MCl's planned labor supervision and
administration cost expressed as a daily rate of $296.20 (budget of $162,911 divided by the
planned 550 days of performance) and mUltiplying by 62 compensable delay days, the District
calculates MCI extended supervision costs to be $18,364.

       The record shows that MCI bid the project assuming that the salary for the project
manager and project superintendent would be direct costs charged to the project under labor
codes 330 and 332. The bid amount for those two tasks totaled $162,911. (District Ex. 130).
                                            Vol 44 No. 44 10-31-1997

 OIS'mICT OF COLUMBIA REGISTER                                                       OCT 3 1 1997

Mel did not bid any other costs for labor supervision and administration, such as for the
categories of project engineer (labor code 331), main office engineering (labor code 335), main
office expediting (labor code 336), and clerical (labor code 338), because Mel planned to have
the project manager and project superintendent handle such tasks. (ld.; 6/21/93 Tr. 126-27).
Mel's job cost records indicate that Mel began incurring payroll expenses under labor code 330
in June 1986 and under labor code 332 in May 1986. (Mel Vol. 2, Exhibit 3, Ex. B, Ex. 1-1).
Mel's job cost records also indicate, however, that Mel began incurring payroll expenses under
labor code 331 (by a person other than Mr. Fawley) beginning in January 1987, payroll and
project administrative expenses under labor code 335 beginning in July 1986 and May 1986
respectively, and payroll expenses under labor code 338 beginning in May 1986. (Mel Vol.
2, Exhibit 3, Ex. B, Ex. 1-1). Thejob cost records further show that Mel incurred other labor
supervision and administration costs beginning early on the project: payroll and project
administrative expenses under labor code 333 (mechanical superintendent) beginning in June
1986 and May 1986 respectively, and payroll and project administrative expenses under labor
code 334 (field office drafting) beginning in December 1986 and May 1986 respectively. (ld.;
6/21/93 Tr. 126-27).

        A review of the job cost records shows that costs under some of the supervision and
administration labor codes increased during the major periods of delay and disruption while
others decreased. There is no evidence that the actual supervision and administration costs were
unreasonable or did not benefit this project. Although there was some testimony that Mel's
field management and staff were responsible for both this project and another project (the sludge
degritting and grinding project) being performed contemporaneously at the same Blue Plains site
(6/21/93 Tr. 129-32; 6/23/93 Tr. 158-61), the District never effectively rebutted Mel's evidence
that the costs charged to the supervision and administration labor codes were costs incurred only
on the present contract. On the whole, we believe that the fairest measure of the extended labor
supervision and administration costs is obtained by computing a daily rate, i. e., dividing the total
actual labor supervision and administration costs by the 802 total days of performance. Even
though Mel commenced charging directly to the job some supervision and administration costs
it had not bid, we see no reason to deny Mel a pro rata share of such costs actually incurred
during a compensable delay period. To the extent that Mel underbid some of these tasks for
performing the original contract scope of work, our approach does not give Mel any undue
recovery because this computation applies only to the delay period and covers labor supervision
and administration that Mel would not have incurred but for the District's constructive changes.
Based on our review of the job cost records and the other record evidence, we find that the total
project labor supervision and administration costs amount to $303,624.80. (Mer Vol. 2, Exhibit
3, Ex. B, Ex. 1-1). This total does not include the amounts Mel claimed for project
coordination performed by Mr. Fawley. Dividing this amount by the total performance period
of 802 days, we arrive at a daily rate of $378.58. Multiplying the daily rate by the 252-day
delay period yields $95,402.

      From the $95,402 total we must subtract any duplicative supervision and administration
amounts Mel has recovered under other equitable adjustments to the contract. The parties have

not identified what portion of the $94,833 adjustment resulting from Change Order No.1 and
the $171,956 stipulated adjustment for the "pending change orders" represents a mark-up for
field supervision and administration. In addition, it is difficult from the record to determine
which of the many changes consolidated in those change orders relate to the compensable delay
period. Based on our review of the job cost records, MCI proposals, and negotiations data, we
make a jury verdict finding that three percent of the change order adjustments, i.e., $8,004,
should be deducted as duplicative mark-up from the pertinent change orders. We must also
deduct the $18,000 for labor supervision which is a component of the adjustment due MCI for
labor inefficiencies and acceleration. Thus, a total of $26,004 should be deducted from MCl's
extended labor supervision and administration total. Accordingly, MCI is entitled to extended
labor and supervision costs amounting to $69,398, to which we add ten percent profit for a final
adjustment of $76,338.

               3. Extended Equipment and General Conditions Costs

        Additional equipment and general conditions costs, incurred by a contractor by virtue of
having to perform contract work for an additional duration beyond what it would have had to
perform but for delay and disruption for which the government bears cost responsibility, are
recoverable. Williams Enterprises v. Strait Mfg. & Welding, 728 F. Supp. at 19-20; George
Hyman Constr. Co., ENG BCA No. 4541,85-1 BCA 1 17,847 at 89,353; Shirley Contracting
Corp., ASBCA No. 29848, 85-1 BCA 1 17,858 at 89,406; Santa Fe Engineers, Inc., 91-1 BCA
123,571 at 118,195-96. Where it is impracticable to derive actual cost data during the delay
period, one recognized measure of the direct costs for extended equipment or general conditions
costs is to compute a daily rate by dividing total equipment and general conditions costs on the
project by the total days of contract performance and then mUltiplying the result by the number
of days of compensable delay. Santa Fe Engineers, Inc., 91-1 BCA '23,571 at 118,195-96;
George Hyman Constr. Co., 85-1 BCA 1 17,847 at 89,353. To the extent that the contractor
already has recovered some equipment or general conditions costs during the delay period as part
of another equitable adjustment under the contract, those amounts must be deducted. George
Hyman Constr. Co., 85-1 BCA 1 17,847 at 89,353.

         MCI claims that it is entitled to extended equipment and general conditions costs for the
252-day delay period. MCI states that it incurred $67,865 in equipment costs and $158,485 in
general conditions costs on the project, for a total of $226,350. MCI calculates a daily
equipment and general conditions rate of $282.24. Multiplying the daily rate times the 252 days
constituting the delay period yields $71,124, to which MCI adds 12 percent profit in arriving
at a total claim of $79,659. The District argues that MCI did not use the appropriate contract
measure for determining its costs for rented and owned equipment, that MCI underbid its
equipment and general conditions costs, and that MCl's total equipment and general conditions
costs were $216,464 rather than $226,350. Using MCl's planned costs expressed as a daily rate
of $296.20 (budget of $162,911 divided by the 802 days of performance) and multiplying by 62
compensable delay days, the District would allow MCI extended equipment and general
conditions costs of $13,210.

 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA REGISTER                                                         OCT 3 1 1997

        Based on our review of the record, we believe that in this case the proper measure of
extended equipment and general conditions costs is obtained by computing a daily rate by
dividing the total actual equipment and general conditions costs by the actual performance
period. To the extent that MCr underbid some of the general conditions costs, such as CPM
scheduling, we see no reason to deny MCr a pro rata share of such costs actually incurred
during the compensable delay period. The District has not persuaded us that MCl's actual
incurred costs were unreasonable. Moreover, the District has not established in fact that the
equipment costs calculated by MCr by using a percentage of the blue book value differs
materially from equipment costs calculated using the hourly rates set forth in the Associated
Equipment Distributor's Manual. Based on our review of the job cost records and the
testimony, we find that the total equipment and general supervision costs amount to $226,350,
as stated by MCr. (MCr Vol. 2, Exhibit 3, Ex. B, Ex. 1-1). The daily rate is $282.24, and
for the 252-day delay period, MCl's equipment and general conditions costs are $71,124.

        From this amount we must subtract any duplicative equipment and general conditions
amounts Mcr has recovered under other equitable adjustments to the contract. As with the case
of the labor supervision and administration, the parties have not identified what portion of the
$94,833 adjustment resulting from Change Order No.1 and the $171,956 stipulated adjustment
for the "pending change orders" represents equipment and general conditions costs. We find that
a deduction of two percent, amounting to $5,336, is proper on the record presented here.
Accordingly, MCI is entitled to $65,788 for extended equipment and general conditions, to
which we add ten percent profit for a final adjustment of $72,367 for extended equipment and
general conditions.

       E. Payments received/Value of uncompleted work

        The parties have stipulated that MCI was paid a total of $2,802,716.48 prior to
termination. (Second Joint Stipulation, 12). The Board has previously found that the contract
was 96.96 percent complete at the time of termination. 39 D.C. Reg. at 4306. Based on that
finding, MCr computed the value of uncompleted work to be $92,511. We find that amount to
be supportable and generally consistent with MCl's project cost-to-complete estimates at the time
of termination.

       MCl's adjusted contract price is calculated as follows:

        MCl's contract cap, pursuant to paragraph F of Article 6, is calculated as follows:

        Adjusted Contract Price                                             $3,605,939

       Because MCl's contract cap is lower than total unpaid performance costs, MCl's
recovery under this element is limited to the amount of the adjusted contract price cap,
$710,712.

II.    Jones & Artis (subcontractor) claim

         MCI seeks on behalf of its subcontractor, Jones & Artis Construction Company, delay
 and impact costs in the amount of $291,450.09. MCI subcontracted with Jones & Artis to
 perform site work, including asphalt paving, concrete paving, excavation and back fill work,
 railroad work, and miscellaneous landscape items. (6/24/93 Tr. 192). Jones & Artis'
 subcontract amount was $588,125.00 which MCI has paid. (6/24/93 Tr. 192, 194). Jones &
 Artis' delay and impact costs consist of $48,692.84 for unabsorbed home office overhead,
$51,725 for labor and equipment inefficiencies, and $191,032.25 for extended supervision and
equipment costs. Jones & Artis has supported its claim with the following documentation of
record: Jones & Artis' initial claim, dated April 3, 1992, in the amount of $337,406.08,
transmitted to the District by MCl's April 10, 1992 letter (MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 5, Ex. 10);
Jones & Artis' second claim, dated May 13, 1992, in the amount of $647,756.81 (MCI Vol. 2,
Exhibit 5, Ex. 11); and Jones & Artis' current claim as presented during the quantum hearing,
in the amount of $291 ,450.09 (MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 5, Ex. 19). Mr. Carl Jones, Jones & Artis'
president and 50 percent owner, was the sole witness testifying in support of the claim.

       Mr. Jones testified that Jones & Artis had an anticipated method and duration of
performance for its work under the subcontract and that Jones & Artis was not able to perform
its work as anticipated due to the constant delays, interruptions, and changes to its work caused
by the District. Mr. Jones testified that Jones & Artis' anticipated method of performance was

disrupted by the DiStrict due to delays in shop drawing reviews for piling, changes in the grades
for the paving work, restricted access to its work areas, draining the forebays, the
instrumentation problems, and chlorine injector water pump problems. (6/24/93 Tr. 198-99,
240, 244-47). According to Mr. Jones, because Mel's schedule and Jones & Artis' plan were
disrupted by the District, Jones & Artis was required to work in and around Mel's work and
work in a piecemeal fashion. Jones & Artis had to stay on the job as long as Mel had to stay
on the job, which was 252 days past the expected Mel contract completion date. (6/24/93 Tr.
239, 242-44).

        There are a number of problems with Jones & Artis' delay and impact claim which
dictate our denying the claim in its entirety.

        First, Jones & Artis never presented into evidence any schedule or plan for its
subcontract performance. In fact, Mr. Jones testified that he did not submit a schedule to Mel
for the subcontract work. (6/24/93 Tr. 228). Mr. Jones testified only that Jones & Artis
intended to perform its work in 180 days, that it would perform its work in "two different
phases" (id. at 238-42), and that the subcontract work required Jones & Artis to be at the jobsite
at the beginning of the project to perform the piling work (id. at 252) and to be at the jobsite
at the end of the project to complete paving work (id. at 253). Mr. Jones did not attempt to tie
and validate any Jones & Artis performance schedule or plan to any Mel schedule. In sum,
Jones & Artis never established and validated a performance schedule or plan for the subcontract
work, including any mobilizations, demobilizations, and usage of field office personnel and
equipment.

         Beyond failing to establish a performance baseline from which to measure critical path
delay in its performance, Jones & Artis never established the fact of compensable delaying
actions for which the District bears cost responsibility. Mr. Jones' conclusory testimony -- that
Jones & Artis experienced a 77-day delay due to submittal delays on the piling work and some
unspecified delay attributable to the District's changing grades for the paving work and
restricting site access -- is unsupported by either specific documentary or testimonial evidence
(6/24/93 Tr. 198-200, 228-31). This deficiency is compounded by the absence in the record of
any contemporaneous notice of a delay or claim for delay. Mr. Jones testified that the delays
occurred throughout the project, from 1986 through termination of its subcontract on September
30, 1988 (e.g., id. at 233). The first claim, or notice of delay, in the record is the one dated
April 3, 1992, some three and a half years after Mel's contract was terminated. Even accepting
that Jones & Artis experienced delay in performing its work, the record simply does not
substantiate that it suffered any compensable, critical path delay.

       As an alternative, Jones & Artis attempts to bootstrap itself onto the 252-day delay period
which the Board has determined was a compensable, critical path delay for Mel. The attempt
must fail. First, that a subcontractor has a work activity that chronologically follows a
compensable, critical path delay period of the general contractor, does not of necessity mean that

the subcontractor experiences the same -- or any -- compensable delay. In the absence of a
specific and validated performance plan, and persuasive documentary and/or testimonial evidence
establishing how the critical delays to MCI translated into a compensable injury to Jones &
Artis, Jones & Artis cannot recover. Jones & Artis did not establish what portion of its grading
and paving activities were delayed. It also did not show a planned or would:have-cost estimate
of labor, supervision, and equipment for such grading and paving. The record, as developed
by Jones & Artis, does not reliably show Jones & Artis' actual commitment of resources to this
project during MCl's 252-day critical path delay. Finally, Mr. Jones' explanation that he could
not obtain other work during project delays to absorb home office overhead because of cash flow
problems (Jones & Artis had "completed a lot of work and had not been paid for it") does not
by itself demonstrate District responsibility. (6/24/93 Tr. 204-05).

         Jones & Artis states that it incurred $51,725 in inefficiency costs because the District
 forced it to work in a piecemeal fashion and restricted its right to proceed with the subcontract
 work, "thereby causing delays and idle personnel and equipment." (MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 5, Ex.
 19). The documentation of inefficiency consists of a single page, listing: (1) various labor
categories, manhours, and pay rates, and (2) various types of equipment, hours, and equipment
rates. (Id.). Mr. Jones testified that on "many days" Jones & Artis field personnel and
equipment would "show up" at the site "to work only to be sent back." (6/24/93 Tr. 206). He
stated: "We had to send the men back because the District had people, other contractors,
occupying the work area and . . . we did not have access to the site area."             (ld.). This
evidence is insufficient to establish causation. Mr. Jones' testimony does not constitute the type
of reasonably specific evidence necessary to demonstrate causation linking disruptions to the
activities rendered inefficient. With regard to jobsite access, Mr. Jones' testimony does not
establish that the District alone bears cost responsibility for whatever instructions Jones & Artis
was receiving at the jobsite. Finally, the record does not support inefficiency quantum. The
documentation is not self-explanatory and Mr. Jones did not explain how he derived any of the
figures. Jones & Artis has furnished no would-have-cost baseline for the activities rendered
inefficient and no data on actual costs for those activities. Therefore, even if we were to
conclude that Jones & Artis had proved entitlement, there is a fatal deficiency in quantum
evidence.

III.   Settlement expenses

        The termination for convenience clause provides that the contractor is entitled to recover
the reasonable expenses "incidental to the determination of the amount due to the Contractor as
the result of the termination of the work under the Contract." Article 6, 1 E.2. The District's
cost principles governing convenience termination settlement costs provides in pertinent part:

       The costs of settlement of the termination (such as accounting, legal, clerical, and
       similar costs reasonably necessary for the preparation and presentation of
       settlement claims to the contracting officer) shall be allowable. Indirect costs
       related to salary and wages incurred as a result of the preparation and

         presentation of settlement claims shall be allowable.

 27 DCMR § 3318.8. Reasonable expenses incurred in negotiating a convenience termination
 claim are allowable as are expenses incurred preparing, presenting, and negotiating adjustments
 in the contract ceiling due to changes. Systems & Computer In/ormation, Inc., ASBCA No.
 18458, 78-1 BCA 1 12,946, at 63,138. Expenses incurred in prosecuting a claim or appeal
 against the government are not allowable settlement expenses. J.E. Robenson Co. v. United
 States, 437 F.2d 1360, 1364 (Ct. Cl. 1971). In determining the allowability of termination for
 convenience settlement expenses, such as legal, accounting, and consulting fees, we examine the
 nature and form of the services rather than simply the point in time when the expenses were
 incurred. Kalvar Corp. v. United States, 543 F.2d 1298, 1305 (Ct. Cl. 1976); Acme Process
 Equip. Co. v. United States, 347 F.2d 538, 545-46 (Ct. Cl. 1965).

          MCI seeks settlement expenses under two categories, "related legal expenses" of
  $180,016.00, and "claim preparation costs" of $131 ,887.00. The "related legal expenses" were
  incurred by MCI in overturning the wrongful default termination and consist of the following
  costs: $138,522 in legal fees paid to its outside counsel, $8,847 in fees paid to its scheduling
  expert, $7,605 in accounting fees paid to Watkins, Meegan, Drury & Co., and an estimated
  $3,000 in consulting fees to be paid to The Barrington Group. (MCI Exhibit 1-80). The claim
  preparation costs consist of $26, 109 in legal fees paid to its outside counsel, $41,103 in fees paid
  to Brower & Company (its scheduling expert), $11,385 in accounting fees paid to Watkins,
I Meegan, Drury & Co., $10,280 in conSUlting fees paid to The Barrington Group, and $43,010
  in internal MCI costs. (MCI Exhibit 1-80).

         We address first MCl's request for professional fees labeled as "related legal expenses"
 which MCI incurred in proceedings to overturn the default termination. Professional fees
 incurred in prosecuting an appeal to convert a termination for default into a termination for the
 convenience of the government are not allowable settlement expenses. E.L. David Constr. Co.,
 ASBCA No. 29225, 89-3 BCA 1 22,140 at 111,437; Paul E. McCollum, Sr., ASBCA No.
 23269, 81-2 BCA 1 15,311 at 75,823-24. MCl's reliance on Baijield Indus., ASBCA No.
 20006, 76-2 BCA 1 12,096 at 58,103-04, is misplaced because MCI has not shown that the
 "related legal expenses" were in the nature and form of settlement negotiations with the
 contracting officer. Indeed, MCI did not make the billing records or invoices a part of the
 record. Accordingly, the "related legal expenses" are not allowable settlement costs.

         With regard to MCl's request for claim preparation costs, there are five elements making
 up the total amount claimed. MCI did not introduce into the record the actual invoices. Instead,
 MCI introduced an exhibit (MCI Ex. 1-80) which summarizes total "claim preparation" and total
 "legal proceedings" costs for each of the five elements of settlement expenses, i.e., legal fees
 and expenses charged by MCl's outside counsel, Watt, Tieder & Hoffar; fees and expenses
 charged by MCl's scheduling consultant, Brower & Company; fees and expenses charged by
 MCl's outside accounting firm, Watkins, Meegan Drury & Co.; fees and expenses charged by
 MCl's accounting conSUltant, Barrington Group; and estimated internal costs of MCI personnel

 are not set forth in Ex. 1-80 or anywhere else in the record. Pages 2 and 3 of Ex. 1-80 only
 identify, by month from November 1988 through May 1993, the monthly legal billings of Watt,
Tieder, & Hoffar allocable as either "claim preparation" or "legal proceedings." Some
 supporting testimony came from Mr. Gerald Holladay, MCl's controller, who testified that he
made the determination as to whether billing amounts or costs under each of the five elements
of settlement costs constituted "claim preparation" or "legal proceedings" costs with the
assistance of outside counsel. From our review of his testimony, and MCI Ex. 1-80, we are not
convinced that he had an adequate understanding of the types of legal costs which would be
allowable costs of preparing, presenting, and negotiating MCl's settlement claim. (E.g., 6/23/93
Tr. 7-8, 32-34). The one page settlement costs summarj attached to MCl's termination for
convenience claim (MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 3, Ex. B, Ex. 7) and the April 14, 1992 MCI letter
(MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 5, Ex. 9) do not aid us in making a determination. The fact that the
District did not properly audit these claimed costs, or, specifically challenge cost items during
the quantum hearing, does not excuse MCI from presenting adequate and reliable evidence of
costs.

         With regard to the legal fees of Watt, Tieder & Hoffar, we find that Mr. Holladay's
  testimony and Ex. 1-80, absent the actual invoices, is insufficient to support the full claim
 preparation amount of $26, 109. Based on our review of the portions of the record which show
  the timing of claim preparation, presentation, and attempted negotiation activity by MCl's
 counsel (MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 5, Exs. 1, 2, 8, 9, 12-17), and MCI Ex. 1-80, we apply a 15
 percent reduction to arrive at an allowable amount of $22, 193 for legal fees. With regard to the
 fees for the scheduling consultant, Brower & Company, we find that Mr. Holladay's testimony
 and Ex. 1-80, absent the actual invoices, is insufficient to support the full claim preparation
 amount of $41,103. Based on our review of the record, including the testimony of scheduling
 consultant (6/24/93 Tr. 69-74), we apply a 50 percent reduction to arrive at an allowable amount
 of $20,552 for the scheduling consultant services. With regard to the fees of Watkins, Meegan,
 Drury, & Co., we allow the full amount requested because the record, including Mr. Watkins'
 testimony, persuades us that the $11,385 amount represents only claim preparation costs. We
 find that $10,280 amount sought as claim preparation costs of the Barrington Group constitutes
litigation costs and are not allowable. (6/24/93 Tr. 163, 183). With regard to MCl's internal
costs, we find that Mr. Holladay's testimony (6/23/93 Tr. 15-19) and the documentation of
record on the issue (MCI Ex. 1-80; MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 3, Ex. B, Ex. 7; MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit
5, Ex. 9) fail to establish a reliable estimate of MCI internal costs incurred in preparing,
presenting, and negotiating MCl's termination claim. Although Mr. Holladay testified that five
employees (including himself) performed claim preparation work, MCI has offered no evidence
on either the number of hours expended by these employees on allowable activities, the figures
and calculations by which it derived labor rates for these employees, or even the allowable costs
incurred by each employee. The internal cost total also includes unallowable costs for employee
time expended on activities other than claim preparation. (MCI Vol. 2, Exhibit 5, Ex. 9).
Therefore, MCI has not demonstrated its right to MCI internal settlement costs.

        In summary, MCI is entitled to recover a total of $54,130 in settlement costs pursuant
 to paragraph E.2 of Article 6.

 IV.    Interest

       MCI seeks interest pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1188.6 at four percent per annum from
the date the Director of DAS received MCl's appeal of the contracting officer's default
termination. The District argues that interest should commence on November 8, 1991, which
is when MCI submitted its termination for convenience settlement claim.

        The interest provision of the Procurement Practices Act recognizes the time value of
money and in conjunction with equitable adjustment compensation -- here, more broadly,
termination for convenience compensation -- contributes to making a contractor whole monetarily
in those areas for which the government bears cost responsibility. In providing the contractor
interest on amounts found due "from the date the Director receives the claim," the interest
provision gives the contracting officer and the contractor an opportunity to settle the claim before
interest begins to accrue. Thus, in the normal equitable adjustment situation or in the context
of a termination for convenience initiated by the contracting officer, the government does not
have to shoulder interest costs for a reasonable period during which the contractor and the
contracting officer attempt to negotiate and settle the claim amount. Only when the contractor
appeals (or submits its "claim") to the Director does interest begin to accrue on any amounts
subsequently determined to be due the contractor.

         In this case, the contracting officer initiated a termination for default action against MCI.
 MCI appealed the default action to the Director, and ultimately appealed to the Board. The
 requirement of section 1-1188.6 was satisfied when the Director received MCl's "appeal" of the
contracting officer's default action because, by appealing the default, the contractor contested
not only the default termination act but also the monetary consequences flowing from that act.
See A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822, 40 D.C. Reg. 4574,4628-29 (1992). Similarly,
by initiating the 1988 default action, the contracting officer not only initiated a series of default
termination procedures but also denied any termination for convenience cost recovery. When
we held in our 1991 entitlement decision that the default action was improper and converted the
default into a convenience termination, we remanded for a quantum determination. It would be
unfair to deny the contractor section 1-1188.6 interest during the period of time from MCl's
challenge of the default action until its submission of the convenience termination cost proposal
after quantum remand by the Board. Certainly, the implicit statutory purpose of providing the
contracting officer some reasonable time to consider costs and settlement is better served by
measuring interest from receipt of the default "claim" rather than receipt of a termination
proposal after Board remand. To hold otherwise would produce the absurd result of rewarding
the government for improperly defaulting a contract -- and having it later converted to a
convenience termination -- rather than terminating for convenience in the first instance. Nor is
it logical that the date for accruing interest should depend on whether the Board, as a matter of
procedure, treats the propriety of the default and quantum in a single proceeding as we did in

Belro, or bifurcates those issues as we did in this case.

        Accordingly, MCI is entitled to interest on its unpaid contract performance costs (limited
to the adjusted contract price cap) at four percent per annum pursuant to section 1-1188.6 from
November 30, 1988, the date that the Director received MCl's claim challenging the default
action, until paid by the District.

        MCI is entitled also to interest on its settlement expenses. Because MCI incurred its
settlement expenses during the period from approximately October 1988 through June ' 1992, it
is not appropriate to award interest using the same date we used for MCl's unpaid performance
costs. Instead, the District shall pay interest on the settlement expenses at four percent per
annum commencing from June 30, 1992, by which time termination settlement negotiations had
ended.

                                        CONCLUSION

       MCI is entitled to recover from the District its Article 6 termination for convenience
costs amounting to $710,712 for unpaid contract performance costs and $54,130 for settlement
expenses, plus interest on those amounts pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1188.6.

       SO ORDERED.
