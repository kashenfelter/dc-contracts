        Under Invitation No. 9081-AA·99·0·9·RS                )


       For the Protestor: Melvin Lee, President. For the Government: Nancy Hapeman,
Assistant Corporation Counsel.

      Opinion by Administrative Judge Benjamin B. Terner, with Administrative Judges
Zoe Bush and Terry Hart Lee concurring.


                                OPINION AND ORDER

        This protest, filed with the Board on January 4, 1989, raises the issue of whether
the failure of the protestor (the incumbent contractor) to receive a copy of Invitation No.
9081·AA·99·0·9·RS (JFB) constitutes grounds for re·solicitation of bids for tree trimming
services.

        The facts are that the District of Columbia Department of Administrative Services
(DAS) issued the IFB in the Sheltered Market. l It posted a copy of the IFB to the six
certified minority business enterprises on the list it received from the Minority Business
Opportunity Commission. In addition, the District advertised the subject IFB in the
Washington Post and the D.C. Procurement Digest. Based on these advertisements,
several prospective bidders requested and were provided copies of the IFB.

      The District received three bids in response to the solicitation. Two of these bids
were from certified minority business enterprises, and were therefore eligible to be


    I "Sheltered Market" is defined as a process• whereby contracts or subcontracts are
designated, before solicitation of bids, for limited competition from minority business
enterprises on either a negotiated or competitive bid process. D.C. Code §1-1142(7)
(1987). Each sheltered market procurement is required to be made in accordance with
the District of Columbia Procurement Practices Act of 1985, D.C. Code §1·1181.1 et seq.
(1987); the Minority Contracting Act of 1976, D.C. Code §1·1141 et seq. (1987); and the
regulations issued pursuant thereto, 27 DCMR (July 1988).
                                            -2-
considered for a "sheltered market" contract. The District contends that the $488,500.00
price of the apparent low bidder was reasonable in that the price paid the incumbent for
the previous year was $496,980.00. At the time of the filing of the agency report, the
contracting officer had not yet conducted a formal price analysis.

       Prior to the award of the contract, the protestor (incumbent contractor) tiled its
protest with the Board, stating that it was protesting because it did not receive a copy of
the invitation for bids. The protestor added that due to a typographical error the IFB was
sent to 317 Mississippi Avenue, S.E., instead of to 17 Mississippi Avenue, S.E., the correct
address.

       The District tiled its agency report in accordance with the bid protest procedures
on March 10, 1989, and a copy was served on the protestor. (Rule 305.2, Rules of Practice
of the D.C. Contract Appeals Board, 36 DCR 2712 (April 21, 1989). However, there has
been no response from the protestor.

       The District contends that failure of the protestor to receive a copy of the subject
IFB is not a sufficient basis for re-solicitation of bids for such tree trimming services, and
it requests that the Board deny this protest.

        The Comptroller General has found that a procuring agency's failure to solicit a
potential bidder does not provide a compelling reason for re-soliciting the procurement
absent a showing that the agency made a deliberate attempt to preclude the potential
bidder from competing, did not make a significant effort to obtain adequate competition,
or failed to obtain reasonable prices. Ansonia Copper & Brass, Inc., B-227002, 87-2 CPD
!76 (July 23, 1987). See also Adrian Supply Co., B-225630, 87-1 CPD ,489 (May 7,1987);
G & L Oxygen and Medical Supply Services, B-220368, 86-1 CPD !78 (January 23,1986);
and Link Telecommunications, Inc., B-216547, 85-1 CPD !41 (January 16, 1985).

       In the instant case there was obviously no deliberate attempt to prevent the
protestor from bidding, because the District did send a copy of the IFB to the protestor,
although it was improperly addressed. According to the record, the mistake was
apparently inadvertent. Agency Report, Exhibit L, Affidavit of Ronnie Edwards. See also,
Trifax Corp., CAB Nos. P-194 and P-197 (July 9, 1991). In addition, the District made
a significant effort to obtain adequate competition by advertising the solicitation, sending
copies of the IFB to those who requested it, and also sending copies to the six certified
minority business enterprises listed by the Minority Business Opportunity Commission.
Finally, there is no evidence in the record which suggests that the District failed to obtain
reasonable prices.

       The protest procedures of the Board provide that when a protestor fails to tile
comments on an agency report, it may result in dismissal of the protest, and the factual
allegations in the protest that are not admitted in the agency report, or otherwise
                                            -3-

corroborated on the record, may be disregarded, Rule 307.3 and 307.4, Rules of Practices
of the Contract Appeals Board, 36 DCR 2710 (April 21, 1989).

       Therefore, it is,

       ORDERED, the protest is DISMISSED with prejudice.
