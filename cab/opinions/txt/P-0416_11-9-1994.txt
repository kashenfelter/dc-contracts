                                            OPINION

       The protester, Sunnyside Service Corporation, protests the District of Columbia
Department of Administrative Services'("DAS") Solicitation No. 4092-AA-03-8-DW. We deny
the protest.

         On July 15, 1994, DAS issued, on behalf of the District's Department of Corrections
("DOC"), Solicitation No. 4092-AA-03-8-DW in the open market to obtain electronic monitoring
services for use in DOC's home detention program. By Addendum No.5, bid opening date has
been revised to November 9, 1994. Two of the protester's complaints about the original
solicitation -- that section C.4.2.3, item a.(02), of the statement of work was unduly restrictive
because it excluded manufacturers of electronic monitoring devices that do not include "built-in"
telephone handsets, and that section C.4.2.2, item j, was unclear and ambiguous -- have been
addressed by Addendum No. 5 and the Board concludes that those issues are now moot.

       The only other issue raised by the protester is that the best interests of the District would
be served by permitting bidders to provide long-term lease pricing as an alternative to rental.
The District replies that the contracting officer has determined that a rental arrangement meets
the agency's minimum needs. The protester has not responded to the agency report and has not
demonstrated that the contracting officer's minimum needs assessment is clearly unreasonable.
See Beretta U.S.A. Corp., CAB No. 144, May 17, 1991,38 D.C.Reg. 3098,3120-21.

        Accordingly, the protest is denied.
