                                               OPINION

         Appellant Fort Myer construction Corporation performed certain services for the District's
Department of Public Works pursuant to a purchase order. In a motion for summaryjudgment, Fort Myer
states that it fully performed its services, properly invoiced the District, but has never been paid for the
services. The District has elected not to respond. Because there is no contention that the District received
the services and has never paid for them, .we'grant summary judgment.

                                           BACKGROUND

      On or about April 2,1996 the District's Department of Public Works, Water & Sewer Utility
Administration requisitioned from Fort Myer certain quantities of asphalt under Purchase Order No.
LA600934. (Fort Myer's Motion for Sumrna~y     Judgnlent ("SJ") Ex. 1).

        Pursuant to the purchase order, DPW picked up the requested asphalt on August 20,1996, and
011September 12,1996,from the Fort Myer batcldngplant. Trucking tickets verify the quantities of asphalt
received by DPW. (SJ Ex. 2). In September 1996, Fort Myer sent DPW invoices that reflected the
quantities of asphalt obtained. (SJ Ex. 3, September 5, 1996 Invoice No. F11549, and September 18,
1996InvoiceNo.Fl1632). These two invoices totaled $2,33 1.90. DPW accepted the asphalt deliveries
andnever objected to the invoices as being improper. Nevertheless, the District has failed to pay Fort
Myer for the asphalt.

       On or about December 2, 1996, Fort Myer sent DPW a demand letter requesting immediate
payment on the outstanding invoices. (SJ Ex. 4). DPW did not respond. On September 10,1997, Fort
Myer filed a notice of abpeal and complaint. The District has failed to file any answer or the appeal file.
