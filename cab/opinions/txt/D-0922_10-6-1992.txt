      Opinion by Administrative Judge Cynthia G. Hawkins-Leon, with Administrative
Judges Zoe Bush and Terry Hart Lee concurring.



                  OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS

       The Board has pending before it the motion of the District to dismiss the above-
captioned appeal on the ground that Ebone, Inc. (flEbone fl or flAppellant fl ) has failed to
exhaust its administrative remedies pursuant to section 805 of the District of Columbia
Procurement Practices Act of 1985 C'PPAfI ), D.C. Code § 1-1188.5 (a), and therefore, the
Board does not have jurisdiction to decide this matter. For the reasons set forth below, the
District's motion is GRANTED, and this case is DISMISSED, without prejudice.

       Appellant filed a complaint with the Board on June 29, 1992. In its complaint,
Appellant appeals the April 28, 1992 letter issued by the Director of the Department of
Public Works (flDPWfI). (A.F. 1.1). The Director of DPW also serves as the Department's
Contracting Officer. (A.F. 3.4). In her April 28, 1992 letter, the DPW Director stated that,
due to several instances of improper behavior, a specific principal of Ebone was prohibited




                                                                                                /~G
                                                 - -2-                            .CAB No. D-922, Ebone, Inc:

  "from all interface -With personnel of: the Design, ,Engineering ,and Construction
 Administration (DEC<\.) for a period of one year from the date of this letter:" The letter
, cited Artide 10, Section E of the General Provisions of the Standard Contract Provisions as
  the authotitY for her actionY
                                                                    -
         The District filed the appeal file on August 7, 1992. The appeal file contains various
  documents referencing several separate instances of what must be interpreted as
  questionable behavior by thi~- principal of Ebone.. (See A.F. 2.1 through 2.19).
  Concurrently, the District filed a -motion to dismiss for Appellant's failure -to exhaust its
  administrative remedies as required by D.C. Code ,§ 1-1188.5(a) and its implementing
-,regulations at 27 DCMR § § 3803 and 3804 (1988).

         In its opposition to the motion to dismiss, filed August 14, 1992, Appellant states that,
 due to the expansive nature of the' DPW Director's letter, the scope was not limited to any
 specific contract(s) and was outside of the scope of any existing contract. Appellant
 contends that the directive by the DPW Director was a general prohibition placed upon
 Ebone .. Appellant thus concludes that it was not required to file a claim with the Director
 of DAS prior to its filing with the Board.Y

        The Board agrees with the Appellant that the directive issued by the DPW Director,
 which amounted to a one-year restraining order against the principal, was indeed a general
 prohibition. The general nature of the directive does not, however, remove it from the
 purview of the thirteen (13) contracts that Ebone has with the District. Therefore, the
 Board holds that the Appellant is required to pursue its claim in accordance with the
 requirements of the PPA.                                                   '

        This Board has consistently held that in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the Board,
 a contractor must first exhaust its administrative remedies with the Director of the
 Department of Administrative Services pursuant to D.C. Code § § 1-1188.5(a) and 1-
 1189.3(2). RDP Development Corporation, CAB No. D-928, 6 P.D. 5154 (May 13, 1993);
 Impex International Industries, CAB No. 890, 40 DCR 4400 (May 15, 1992); Mid-Atlantic
 Service Industries, Inc., CAB No. 826, 39 DCR 4418 (February 11, 1992); Tensas
 Enterprises, CAB No. D-868, 39 DCR 4362 (December 12, 1991).




    liThe Board questions whether the letter issued by the DPW Director on April         28;  1992 meets the
 requirements of contracting officer's final decision pursuant to the Procurement Regulations. See 27 DCMR
 § 3803.5 (1988).


    ~/The Board notes that were this the case, Appellant would not have a justiciable claim before the Board.
 See D.C. Code § 1-1189.3.




                                                                                                          /61
                                           -3-                       CAB No. D-922, Ebone, Inc.

       Wherefore, based on the foregoing, the District's motion to dismiss is GRANTED.
Appellant is directed to file a claim with the Director of the Department of Administrative
Services pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1188.5(a) if Appellant wishes to further pursue an
appeal with the Board. This appeal is therefore DISMISSED, without prejudice.

      So ORDERED.
