                             OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION
                                 FOR RECONSIDERATION

       By Order dated September 23, 1993, the Board denied Protestor's claim for bid
preparation costs. Tito Contractors. Inc., CAB Nos. P-363 and P-366 (Consolidated) (Claim
for Costs), 6 P.D. 5407 (September 23, 1993). Protestor has timely moved for reconsideration
of the Board's decision. I In its motion, Protestor asserts that its bid preparation costs were
adequately documented and that the costs were reasonable.

        The District of Columbia has responded in opposition to the motion and correctly points
out that the motion sets forth no factual or legal grounds which warrant reversal of the Board's



   'The Board Rules provide at 36 DCR 2696:

       117.1   A party to an appeal or a protest may by motion request the Board to reconsider its
               decision or order for the reasons stated below:

               (a)     To clarify the decision;

               (b)     To present newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have
                       been presented to the Board prior to the rendering of its decision;

                       (c)      If the decision contains typographical, numerical, technical or other
                                clear errors that are evident on their face; or

                       (d)      If the decision contains errors of fact or law, except that parties shall
                                not present arguments substantially identical to those already considered
                                and rejected by the Board.

decision. The District further persuasively argues that Protestor merely disagrees with the
Board's order and reiterates arguments previously considered and rejected by the Board.

       We agree with the District and find that Protestor has failed to comply with Board Rule
1l7.1(d), footnote 1, supra. Under these circumstances the Board has consistently denied
motions for reconsideration because they lack merit. O'Donnell Construction Company -

       The foregoing considered, the motion is hereby DENIED.
