                                                OPINION

         The Departinent of Public Works ("DPW") determined that the bid of GranTurk Equipment
Company, In~., for refuse trucks was nonresponsive because its proposed truck did not meet certain
specification requirements. GranTurk protested, claiming that its proposed truck complied with the
specifications. The District moved to dismiss this protest ground as untimely filed. GranTurk also
challenges a post-award bilateral modification ofthe contract awarded 10 Maryland Industrial Trucks, Inc.
We agree with the District that GranTurk's protest was untimely filed with regard to the nonresponsiveness
issue and that the challenge to the contract modification is without meri 1. Accordingly, GranT urk' s protest
is dismissed in part and denied in part. B&B Equipment Company and Mid-Atlantic Waste Systems also
filed protests challenging the modification ofthe awardee's contract. We dismiss B&B' s protest because
B&B lacks standing. We dismiss Mid-Atlantic's protest because it was untimely filed.

                                            BACKGROUND

         On February 10, 1998, the Department of Public Works iss~led IFB No. 98-0043-AA-OMS-GU
for the acquisition of celiain vehicles, including dmnp trucks, refuse trucks, wagons, vans, and sport utility
vehicles. (District's Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 1). Bid Items 5 and6 solicited bids for refuse trucks that
consisted oftwo general parts, a low entry forward cab truck and a rear loading body. Sections 5.4.1,
5.22,6.4.1, and 6.22 of the specifications required seats for three persons, consisting of a vinyl bucket seat
for the driver and a vinyl bench seat for two persons for Items 5 and 6. (Jd.). Section 5.38 of the
specifications provided that the maximum length was 308 inches from bumper to tailgate. Section 17 of
the Special Conditions required bidders to submit descriptive literature ofthe bid items being proposed.
(Id., Ex. 1, at 113). DPW issued Amendment Nos. 1-8 which amended certain portions of the
specifications not pertinent here and extended the bid opening date to June 22, 1998. (Id., Ex. 2).
                                                                       ,
                                                                                                        [7706]



                                                    _ 2 - GranTlIrk Equip., et aI., CAB Nos. P-568, P-571, P-578

         On June 22, 1998, DPW opened the bids. Three bidders, GranTurk, Maryland Industrial Trucks,
 Inc. ("MIT"), and Mid-Atlantic Waste Systems, submitted bids for Items 5 and 6. GranTurk was the
 apparent low bidder on Items 5 and 6. (fd., Ex. 3). GranTurk offered a low entry forward cab truck
 manufactured by Fontaine Modification Company and a rear loading body manufactured by Leach.
 (GranTurkProtest ~ 5; District Ex. 5). GranTurk also submitted a bid as a subcontractor to provide the
 Leach rear loading bodies for the refuse trucks offered by MIT in its bid for Items 5 and 6. (Protest'15).

         In a memorandwn dated June 23, 1998, Mr. Wayne Thomas 0 f DP W' s Division 0 fFI eet Services
 found that the bid of GranTurk was nonresponsive for Item 5 because the cab ofthe renlse truck proposed
 by GranTurk had only two seats, not the required three seats, and the overall length of the truck was more
 than 308 inches. (fd., Ex. 4). Mr. Thomas also determined that GranTurk's bid on Item 6 was
 nonresponsive because the cab of the refuse truck proposed by GranTurk had only two seats. The
 descriptive literature submitted by GranTurk with its bid described a Fontaine cab having only two seats
 and a total length of the truck (cab plus rear loading body) exceeding 308 inches.

          Also on June 23, 1998, B&B Equipment Company filed a protest alleging that the specifications
  for renlse truck cabs were unduly restrictive because they could be supplied by only one source, Crane
  CatTier Truck Manufacturing of Oklahoma. We ultimately dismissed that protest because it was not timely
  filed. B&B Equipment Co., CAB No. P-549, Aug. 26,1998,45 D.C. Reg. 8823. DPW's Division of
  Fleet Services was asked to respond to the protest allegation. In a June 24, 1998 memorandum, Mr.
, Thomas stated that a representative from the cab's manufacturer, Fontaine, had indicated that its cab could
  meet the three-person seating requirement if some engineering modifications were made to the cab. (Id.,
  Ex. 6).

         On June 25, 1998, DPW' s contracting officer signed a determination for awarding Items 5 and 6
 to MIT, the second low bidder, on the basis that Gran Turk 's proposed vehicles did not meet the
 specifications. (District Ex. 8).

          GranTmkstates that itdid not receive acopyofMr. Thomas' June 23 memonmdull1 regmdingthe
 nonresponsiveness of GranTurk' s bid on Items 5 and 6. GranTurk representatives assert in affidavits that
 the first time they learned from the District that GranTurk' s bid for Items 5 and 6 had been determined
 nomesponsive was on December 29, 1998, in a conversation between the contracting officer and
 GranTurk's Senior Vice President. (GranTurkReply, filed Februmy 16,1999 (Chernin Arf. ~7; Ritchie
 Aff. '110). We find otherwise. On July 10, 1998, GranTurk sent a IeHer to DPW's contracting officer,
 which stated:

         We have been informed that ... our bid has been considered non-responsive for the
         following reason: "In connection with item #5; (1) Descriptive literature did not show three
         man cab." This reason reflects an apparent [misreading] of our bid. If we were not
         supplying a three man cab we would certainly have taken an exception. or comse, we did
         not. ... "In connection with item #5; (2) Descriptive literature does not show 308" overall
         length." The descriptive literature shows a ... bumper to back of cab dimension ... of
                                                                                                                 [7707]


                                                   _ 3 - Gran Turk Equip.,   el aI.,   CAB Nos. P-568, P-571, P-578


        102". The body length is 205" .... The resulting overall length of)06" is better than the
        maximum of308" in the bid specs .... With regard to item #6; '"Descriptive literature
        didn't support three man cab seating." Our response is the same as item #5. We ARE
        supplying three man seating .... We wish to reiterate in the strongest possible terms that
        our bid meets your bid specifications. There is absolutely no reason to reject our bid as
        non-conforming ....

(District Ex. 9). GranTurk now states that its infonnation was based on "rumor." In a July 17, 1998 letter,
DPW's contracting officer replied as follows:

         My office has received your letter of July 10, 1998, which provides information clarifying
         the refuse trucks bid by your company in response to the subject solicitation. I have
         forwarded this information to the Fleet Services Division (FSD) and requested that the
       . technical evaluation for the refuse trucks bid by your company be reexamined taking into
         consideration tlns additional information. I anticipate having a response from FSD within
         the coming week and will inform you ofihe agency's conclusions.

        However, ifyou wish to file a protest, it should be filed.with the Contract Appeals Board



(District Ex. 10). GranTurk argues that DPW' s July 17 letter does not definitively state that GranTurk had
previously been found nonresponsive by the DPW. Reading GranTurk' s July 10 letter together with the
contracting officer's July 17 reply, we find that GranTurk was on reasonable notice that its bid on Items
5 and 6 had been determined nonresponsive but that DPW was going to reexamine the matter based on
the new information provided by GranTurk. Although the contracting officer did not expressly state that
GranTurk had been determined nonresponsive in the July 17 reply, that was not necessary because
GranTurk itself stated in the July 10 letter that it had been so "informed." Thus, the contracting officer's
indication to "reexamine" the matter logically presupposes and affirms the prior nonresponsiveness
determination of which GranTurk had been informed.

         GranTurk received a further notice ofthe contracting officer's June 25, 1998 determination of
nonresponsiveness when it received the District's August 3, 1998 filing in B&B' s solicitation protest in
CAB No. P-549, which contained the following statement: "On June 25,1998, the Contracting Officer
for DPW executed a determination and findings that found MIT responsible for Items 5 and 6, since it
fOlmd GranTurknonresponsive for Items 5 and 6." (Motion ofthe District ofColtunbia to Dismiss Protest
or, in the Alternative Agency Report, filed August 3, 1998, at 5-6):




1 There are a number of other disputed events which the District claims provided GranTurk notice ofthe

nonresponsiveness determination. GranTurk's representatives deny receiving notice. None ofthe disputed
events alter our finding that GranTurk received notice oHhe nonresponsiveness detennination long before
December 29, 1998, as alleged in its January 8, 1999 protest.

                                                                       ,
                                                     _4 -   Gran Turk Eq1lip,   ~t aI, CAB Nos. P-568, P-571, P-578

       On November 5,1998, DPW awarded the contract to MIT for Items 5, 6, and 7. (AREx. 20).
 On December 22, 1998, the contracting officer and MIT executed a bilateral modification substituting a
 Dempster body for the Leach body under Hem 5.

         GranTurk's senior vice president states that on December 29,1998, she spoke with DPW's
 contracting officer and that the contracting officer advised her "that he w~s going to recommend an award
 of a contract for items 5 and 6 to MIT because the GranTurk bid was non responsive and that the MIT
 bid had been amended to delete GranT m'k as the subcontractor to provide the Leach truck bodies because
 he had allowed MIT to substitute another subcontractor to provide the refuse truck bodies.'j (Protest ~
 13; cf GranTurk Reply filed February 16, 1999 (Ritchie AiT't~~ 8-9»).

         On February 5,1999, B&B:EquipmeI11 filed a new protest, docketed as CAB No. P-571,
 challenging the bilateral modi ucation to MIT's contract by which the Leach body was replaced with the
 Dempster body. On March 1, 1999, the District moved to dismiss this protest on the ground that B&B
 lacks standing because it was neither an actual or prospective bidder having l~liled to submit a bid on Item
 5. B&B has not responded to the motion.

         On March 9, 1999, Mid-Atlantic Waste Systems filed a protest, docketed as CAB No. P-578,
  also challenging the bilateral modification to Mrr'~ contract. In a March 26, 1999 conference,
  Mid-Atlantic and the District agreed that this contract modification issue was raised in the related protests
  of GranTurk and B&B and that additional filings were unnecessary because the protest issue has been
. adequately briefed.

                                               DISCUSSION

          Protests, other than those based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation, must be filed not later
 than 10 business days after the basis of protest is known or should have been kllmvn, whichever is earlier.
 D.C. Code § 1-1189.8(b) (Supp. 1998). GranTurk knew the basis for its protest challenging the
 nonresponsiveness determination by July 1998 but did not file ,a protest until January 8, 1999. The
 contracting officer's tmdertaking to reexamine the nonresponsiveness determination did not toll the deadline
 for filing its protest. CUP Temporaries, Inc., CAB No. P-263, Aug. 31, 1993,41 D.C. Reg. 3615,
 3616; Tandy Construction, Inc., B-238619, Feb. 22,1990,90-1 CPD '1206.

         Regarding GranTmk's challenge onhe modification of"l'v11T' s bid," that argument mllst fail because
 the December 22, 1998 bilateral modification was made to the contract awarded to MIT on November 5,
 1998. The post-award modification had no effect on bidders or the underlying competition because l'v11T's
 bid was responsive notwithstanding the post-award substitution of one truck body for another. This
 disposition resolves the issues raised by B&B and Mid-Atlantic in their protests. The protests ofB&B and
 Mid-Atlantic must be dismissed, however, because the record shows that: (1) B&B lacks standing to
 protestawardltem 5 since it did not submit a bid; and (2) Mid-Atlantic' s protest is lmtimely because Mid-
 Atlantic received notice ofthe basis for its protest when it received a copy onhe District's February 1,
 1999 motion to dismiss (filed in GranTurk's protest), but did not file until March 9, 1999.
                                                                                                           [7709]

      Accordingly, GranTurk's protest is dismissed in part and denied in patio The protests ofB&B atld
Mid-Atlantic are dismissed.
