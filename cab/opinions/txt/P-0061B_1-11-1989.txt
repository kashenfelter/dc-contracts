PROTEST OF:
       PINNACLE CORPORATION
       Under IFB No. 86-0062-AA-2-0-CC

     For the Protester: Jack Rephan, Esq.      For the Government: Frank E.
Barber, Assistant corporation Counsel, D.C.
     opinion by Administrative Judge Davis with Administrative Judges
Booker and Sharpe1 concurring.

                              SUMMARY OF OPINION
P.ROCEIXJRE--RECONSIDERATION--ARGOMENTS AIRFADY CONSIDERED--Where arguments
advanced in motion for reconsideration were fully considered by Board in
its original decision, and rejected, motion will be denied since moving
party does not allege any new evidence or new arguments.

                                   OPINION
       The Government has moved that the Board reconsider its decision
rendered on November 18 , 1988,     in the above-captioned case.      In that
decision,     this Board held that where the Government failed to state
clearly in its invitation for bids the legitimate policy decision it had
made that roofing contractors themselves must have five years of relevant
roofing experience, it could not properly exclude from consideration the
relevant roofing experience of a corporation's officers and employees
when   evaluating whether the     corporation met the    five years   roofing
experience requirement.




     1Judge Sharpe's participation in this case is pursuant to the
authority contained in the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985, D. C.
Code, sec. 1-1189.2(c) (2) (1987 Replacement).
                                     - 2 -

        As grounds for its motion, the Government alleges that the Board
erroneously placed an interpretation on the word "contractor"       other than
that which spe~ial Condition No. 10 of the invitation for bids at issue
called for.      The Government contends that the word "contractor," as used
in the special condition, means the legal entity itself.
        Motions for reconsideration have,     as their primary purpose,    the
opportunity to present newly discovered evidence or evidence not readily
available at the time of the principal decision.            This Board,   when
confronted with a motion which merely presents arguments which were fully
considered by the Board in rendering its decision, absent anything more,
will almost certainly deny the motion.
        In its motion, the Government does not advance any new arguments
but appears content to rehash arguments which were previously considered
and rej ected by this Board.        This basis is insufficient to warrant
reversal of our original decision.           Moreover, we continue to remain
unpersuaded by the Government's contentions.
        The motion for reconsideration is DENIED.
