                 ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION

        On December 26, 2000, Sasha Bruce Youthwork (“SBY”) filed a motion for reconsideration
of our decision that dismissed these consolidated protests based on an adequately justified
determination to cancel the solicitation. Sasha Bruce Youthwork, CAB Nos. P-594, 597, Dec. 1,
2000, 11 P.D. 8034. In its motion, SBY requests that the Board clarify and reconsider its decision
because of unspecified errors of fact and law. SBY also requests leave to engage in discovery “in
order to establish a sufficient factual basis for the fair and just resolution of the protest.” Finally,
SBY states that a supporting brief would be provided under separate cover. However, SBY filed no
supporting memorandum.

       We conclude that SBY has not provided a sufficient basis for reconsideration of our decision
dismissing the protests. SBY’s request for discovery is untimely and without merit. Accordingly,
we deny its motion for reconsideration.

       SO ORDERED.
