                                      (Lexis-Nexis Filing ID 11825911)

        Infrastructure Corporation of America (ICA) protests the District’s action of issuing
Amendment No. 5 to the Request for Proposals (RFP). ICA asserts that Amendment No. 5
revised the RFP’s performance requirements in a significant manner but did not provide
reasonable additional time to submit proposals, thereby unfairly eliminating competition. The
District responds that it properly amended the solicitation and that the Board should dismiss the
protest. Because the protester failed to factually support the allegations, we deny the protest.

                                            BACKGROUND

        On December 1, 2005, the District of Columbia Office of Contracting and Procurement,
(“OCP”), through the District Department of Transportation (“DDOT”), issued RFP No. POKA-
2005-R-0034-CB, NHS Asset Preservation DC Streets II. The RFP requested offerors to submit
proposals that could provide to the District asset management services to rehabilitate and
maintain designated roadway and roadside assets for a base period of two years and potentially
for three additional option years. Prospective contractors were to submit offers for Contract Line
Item Numbers (“CLINS”) for basic roadway and roadside rehabilitation and maintenance. The
RFP also requested proposals for additive alternate CLINs for snow removal and tree and debris
removal which could be added to the contract if funds were available. (Agency Report (“AR”)
Ex. 1).

  By letter dated May 22, 2006, VMS, Inc., submitted a second motion to intervene in the protest. The Board
hereby grants the VMS request to file its Comments to the Agency Report and Response to ICA’s Comments on the
Agency Report.

       Thirteen companies picked up copies of the RFP. Five of those companies appeared to
be able to meet the RFP bonding requirements. (AR Ex. 1 and 10). The District conducted a
pre-proposal conference on December 21, 2005, attended by representatives of all thirteen
potential offerors. (AR Ex. 10). Amendment No. 2, issued December 30, 2005, requested
proposals from offerors on January 31, 2006. (AR Ex. 1 and 10).

        Prospective offerors at the pre-proposal conference submitted 42 questions. ICA
submitted two additional questions by e-mail dated December 22, 2005. (AR Ex. 10). OCP and
DDOT provided written responses to these questions in Amendment No. 3, dated January 6,
2006. In the response, OCP declined ICA’s request to extend the proposal deadline for an
additional 45 days beyond January 10, 2006, as well as ICA’s request to extend the mobilization
period for an additional 30 days. (AR Ex. 4). OCP and DDOT issued Amendment No. 4 on
January 20, 2006. Amendment No. 4 answered three additional questions submitted by potential
offerors. (AR Ex. 4). On January 31, 2006, VMS, Inc. submitted the only timely proposal. (AR
Ex. 10).

       DDOT’s evaluators met on February 8, 2006, to consider the VMS proposal. (AR Ex.
10). DDOT held negotiation sessions with VMS on February 17 and March 17, 2006. (AR Ex.
10). After the second session DDOT decided to revise the RFP. In the amendment, DDOT
deleted a number of locations that had already been paved under other contracts. (AR Ex. 10).
The effect of the amendment was to reduce the scope of work and thus the cost of the job.
DDOT hoped the amendment would encourage the other prospective contractors to submit
proposals.

        DDOT issued Amendment No. 5 to the RFP, dated March 29, 2006, to all potential
offerors on the bidders list, except the District initially failed to send Amendment No. 5 to VMS.
(AR Ex. 5). The District later sent Amendment No. 5 to VMS by facsimile on April 14, 2006.
(AR Ex. 10). Amendment No. 5 removed several items of work from the RFP. (AR Ex. 6).
Amendment No. 5 adjusted the method of testing for the International Roughness Index (“IRI”),
by excluding from the index utility cuts. (The IRI prescribes tests for pavement smoothness).
Amendment No. 5 also allowed the contractor additional time to meet the IRI compliance date
by extending the IRI compliance date from six months after award to a full year after award.
(AR Ex. 10). Amendment No. 5 erroneously stated that the January 31, 2006, due date for
proposals was not extended. However, the amendment required offerors to acknowledge receipt
of the amendment by April 14, 2006. (AR Ex. 10).

       There is no indication that ICA contacted DDOT about Amendment No. 5 from March
29 through April 9, 2006. On April 10, 2006, David Rader from ICA contacted DDOT by
telephone and spoke with OCP Supervisory Contract Specialist Kathy Hatcher regarding
Amendment No. 5. (AR Ex. 9). In that conversation, Ms. Hatcher confirmed that the District
was in negotiations with VMS, but stated that the District had modified several terms and
conditions that could affect prices and change the quality of services and delivery schedule. Ms.
Hatcher told Mr. Rader that the District had decided to send the addendum to all firms that had
received a copy of the RFP to give those firms an opportunity to respond by submitting
proposals. Ms. Hatcher told Mr. Rader that, if asked, the District would grant an extension of

                                                      Infrastructure Corporation of America, CAB No. P-0731


time of two weeks beyond the (presumed) closing date of April 14, 2006, in which to respond to
the revised RFP. According to Ms. Hatcher, Mr. Rader informed her that two weeks was not
enough time, and that ICA needed from 60 to 90 days to submit a proposal. (AR Ex. 9). ICA
filed its protest on April 13, 2006.

        By Amendment No. 6 dated April 14, 2006, the District extended the date for submission
of offers to April 28, 2006. (AR Ex. 7). By Amendment No. 7, dated April 28, 2006, but
actually signed and faxed to all prospective offerors on April 24, 2006, the District extended the
date for submission of offers to May 8, 2006. (AR Ex. 8 and 10). The May 8 deadline passed
without any new submissions from prospective offerors or even a revised offer from VMS.
DDOT states that VMS’s original proposal is still under consideration.

                                         DISCUSSION

       ICA asserts that Amendment No.5 was a substantial change to the solicitation, and that
the District should have allowed prospective offerors more time to respond to the new
requirements of the solicitation. The District responds that OCP complied with all regulations
when it issued Amendment No. 5 and that ICA has not shown the District any reason to extend
the proposal due date.

        We begin by observing that ICA has not demonstrated – with evidence of record – why it
could not prepare a proposal from March 29 through May 8, a total of 40 calendar days. On that
basis, we must deny its protest in view of the affidavit from DDOT indicating that the response
time was reasonable. Nevertheless, the District clearly must appreciate that during this period –
intended to spur additional competition – not a single new offer was submitted nor did VMS
submit a revised proposal. Moreover, the issuance of the last three solicitation amendments were
accompanied by glaring errors and sloppy work by the contracting agency. There is no
indication in the record that the contracting officer has completed negotiations with VMS, much
less made an award. Thus, nearly seven weeks after the revised closing date, we are left
wondering if perhaps the contracting officer should not have given prospective offerors more
time to offerors to respond. Apart from ICA, none of the other eleven prospective offerors seems
interested in the procurement. We hope that DDOT has made inquiry to see why that is, and,
with the contracting officer, is working on a plan to inject some meaningful competition into a
project that clearly should have ample competition.

                                         CONCLUSION

         For the reasons discussed above, we deny the protest.
