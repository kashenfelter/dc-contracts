                                            OPINION
                                     LexisNexis Filing ID 5742822

        Appellant, W.M. Schlosser Company, Inc., filed this appeal on behalf of its subcontractor,
Tate Fabricating Company, Inc., from an August 25, 2004 final decision of the General Manager of
the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (“WASA”). WASA has moved to dismiss the
appeal on the ground that the Board lacks jurisdiction over WASA procurements. We agree with
WASA that D.C. Code §§ 2-309.03, 2-301.04, and 2-303.20 specifically exempt WASA
procurements from the Procurement Practices Act (“PPA”) and the Board’s jurisdiction, and
accordingly we dismiss the appeal.

                                        BACKGROUND

         In 2001, WASA awarded Schlosser Contract No. 99-0040 for the construction of additional
dewatering facilities at the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant located in the District of
Columbia. Schlosser, as prime contractor, issued a subcontract to Tate Fabricating to furnish and
install certain structural steel and steel deck as well as other miscellaneous metals pursuant to the
contract. Tate claims that it incurred increased costs as a result of WASA directed changes and
modifications to the structural steel portion of the project. WASA has promulgated procurement
regulations at 21 DCMR Chapter 53. Those regulations provide for submitting claims to a
contracting officer and a second level review of claims by the WASA General Manager. WASA’s
procurement regulations also contain the following disputes provision:

       21-5361. CONTRACT DISPUTE RESOLUTION

       5361.1 WASA shall attempt to resolve all contract disputes arising under, or relating
       to, contracts by mutual agreement after informal discussions have taken place
       between the contractor and WASA.
                                                -2-                    W.M. Schlosser Co., CAB No. D-1254




       5361.2 The Contracting Officer shall consider the advisability of including a
       disputes resolutions clause in all contracts. Dispute resolution clauses may require
       alternate dispute resolution.

         Tate Fabricating submitted a claim to Schlosser, who in turn submitted the claim to WASA’s
contracting officer. On June 1, 2004, WASA’s contracting officer denied the claim. Schlosser
sought review of the claim and the contracting officer’s decision by petitioning WASA’s General
Manager. On August 25, 2004, the General Manager issued a decision denying the claim. On
November 30, 2004, Schlosser appealed the General Manager’s decision to the Board. Noting that
there might be a question as to whether we have jurisdiction over the appeal, Schlosser states that it
also filed simultaneously a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
based on diversity jurisdiction. On December 30, 2004, WASA moved to dismiss the appeal on the
ground that the Board lacks jurisdiction over WASA procurements. Schlosser filed a motion to stay
or extend the time to respond to WASA’s motion pending resolution of jurisdiction in the United
States District Court.

                                           DISCUSSION

       D.C. Code § 2-309.03(b) provides in relevant part:

       Jurisdiction of the Board shall be consistent with the coverage of this chapter [the
       Procurement Practices Act] as defined in §§ 2-301.04 and 2-303.20, except that the
       Board shall have the authority to enter into fee-for-service agreements with agencies,
       departments, boards, commissions, and instrumentalities of the District or other
       public entities that are not subject to the Board’s jurisdiction.

       Section 2-301.04 provides that the PPA shall apply to all departments, agencies,
instrumentalities, and employees of the District government except as provided in section 3-303.20.
Section 3-303.20(j) provides:

       Nothing in this chapter [the Procurement Practices Act] shall affect the District of
       Columbia Water and Sewer Authority's powers to establish and operate its
       procurement system and to execute contracts pursuant to Chapter 22 of Title 34. . . .

Chapter 22 of Title 34 contains D.C. Code § 34-2202.14 which provides that “Except as provided in
§ 2202.17(b) [transition provisions not relevant here], [D.C. Code] § 2-301.01 et seq. [the
Procurement Practices Act], shall not apply to the [Water and Sewer] Authority.”

        Taken together, these provisions make clear that the Board does not exercise jurisdiction
over WASA procurements conducted pursuant to WASA’s own procurement system under the
authority of Chapter 22 of Title 34 of the D.C. Code. Because the procurement at issue here was
conducted pursuant to WASA’s procurement authority, we lack jurisdiction to consider any appeal
from the General Manager’s decision on Schlosser’s sponsored claim on behalf of Tate Fabricating.
See Dixon’s Termite and Pest Control, Inc., CAB No. P-0659, Aug. 7, 2002, 50 D.C. Reg. 7453,
                                              -3-                   W.M. Schlosser Co., CAB No. D-1254



7454. Schlosser and Tate Fabricating are not without recourse because, as WASA observes in its
pleadings, there is at least one forum where Schlosser can seek judicial review of the decision of
WASA’s General Manager.

       Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.

       SO ORDERED.

DATED: May 3, 2005                                  /s/ Jonathan D. Zischkau
