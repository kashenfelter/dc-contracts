                                           OPINION

        The Metis Group has filed a protest of Solicitation No. 9063-AA-03-1-DD issued by the
District’s Office of Contracting and Procurement (“OCP”), alleging that OCP improperly extended
the closing date for proposals to December 9, 1999, and undermined confidence in the selection
process by issuing 10 amendments over a 12-month period ending with a second best and final offer
request on August 24, 2000. The District filed a motion to dismiss the protest as untimely. The
Metis Group has not responded. We dismiss the protest as untimely.

                                       BACKGROUND

        On September 20, 1999, the Office of Contracting and Procurement issued the Facility
Condition Assessment Request for Proposals in the small business enterprise set-aside market.
(District’s Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 1). As a result of Amendment Nos. 1-4, and 6 to the RFP, the
original closing date for initial proposals of October 15, 1999, was extended to December 8, 1999.
(Protest, at 2). OCP received 9 proposals by December 8. (Motion to Dismiss, at 5). On December
27, 1999, OCP issued Amendment No. 7 which retroactively extended the closing date for proposals
to December 9, 1999, so that 5 additional proposals that had been received between December 8 and
9, but after the December 8 closing date and time, could be accepted. (Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 1).
Thus, OCP had received a total of 14 proposals as of the December 9 closing date. The contracting
officer determined that 9 offerors, including The Metis Group, were within the competitive range.
(Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 2). OCP issued Amendment No. 8 on June 6, 2000, requesting offerors to
extend their proposals for 90 days. (Protest, at 2). On June 20, 2000, OCP issued Amendment No.
9, amending the solicitation and requesting best and final offers (“BAFOs”) by June 30, 2000. OCP
issued Amendment No. 10 requesting a second round of BAFOs by August 24, 2000. On September
6, 2000, OCP made awards to three offerors. The Metis Group filed its protest on September 21,
2000, challenging OCP’s issuing of Amendment 7 on December 27, 1999, which extended
retroactively the closing date for proposals from December 8 to December 9, 1999, as well as
challenging the lengthy procurement process which saw 10 amendments issued over a 10-month
period.
                                                 -2-                     The Metis Group, CAB No. P-627

        On October 12, 2000, the District filed a motion to dismiss the protest as untimely, pointing
out that The Metis Group filed its protest long after it knew or should have known of the bases for its
protest. The Metis Group has not responded to the motion.

                                           DISCUSSION

       The Procurement Practices Act defines the following deadlines for filing a protest:

       (b)(1) A protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent
       prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed prior
       to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. In procurements where
       proposals are requested, alleged improprieties which do not exist in the initial
       solicitation, but which are subsequently incorporated into this solicitation, must be
       protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of proposals following the
       incorporation.

          (2) In cases other than those covered in paragraph (1) of this subsection, protests
       shall be filed not later than 10 business days after the basis of protest is known or
       should have been known, whichever is earlier.

D.C. Code § 1-1189.8(b). It is clear that the protest must be dismissed as untimely. The Metis
Group failed to file its protest either by the various closing dates set by the amendments or within 10
business days from the date that it knew or should have known the bases for its protest. See, e.g.,
Commando K-9 Detectives, Inc., CAB No. P-472, Jan. 16, 1997, 44 D.C. Reg. 6782.

       Accordingly, we dismiss the protest.

       SO ORDERED.

DATE: November 2, 2000
