                                            OPINION
                                   (Lexis-Nexis Filing ID 10458203)

        Protester Arriba Center alleged in its protest that the District had improperly excluded
Arriba from the award of a grant under Education Grant Request for Applications (“RFA”) No.
1215-06. The RFA closed on July 15, 2005. On October 20, 2005, Arriba filed its protest. The
District filed a Motion to Dismiss the protest, asserting that the Board lacks jurisdiction to review
a grant award. The Board agrees and dismisses the protest.

                                            DISCUSSION

        On May 26, 2005, the Office on Latino Affairs (“OLA”) issued RFA No. 1216-06 for
award of educational grants (Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 1). The source of the grant funds is the
OLA Latino Community Education Grant Program. Arriba submitted its application to OLA in
response to the RFA. The FY 2006 Latino Community Education Grant Program offers grants
of up to $85,000 to community based organizations located in the District of Columbia. The
grant funds are intended to enhance existing and startup programs focused on education and job
preparedness. A successful application for the funds would result in a grant to the party that
submitted the application.

    The Board’s jurisdiction is established by the Procurement Practices Act. D.C. Code § 2-
309.03 (2001 ed.). That Act specifically excludes from its coverage, and therefore from the
Board’s jurisdiction, any “contract or agreement receiving or making grants-in-aid or for federal
financial assistance.” Id. § 2-301.04(b). Since this matter relates to the award of a grant, the
Board is without jurisdiction. Community Health Ministry, CAB No. P-0665, Mar. 25, 2003, 50
D.C. Reg. 7486.
                                             2
                                                                     Arriba Center, CAB No. P-0718



   The protest is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
