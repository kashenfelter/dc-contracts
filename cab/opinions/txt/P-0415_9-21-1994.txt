       This matter concerns an appeal filed by Shannon and Luchs Commercial D.C., Inc.
("protestor" or "S&L") of the denial of its protest against cancellation of Request for Proposal
No. 007-AA-NS-O-3-BB ("RFP"), issued by the District of Columbia Public Schools ("DCPS").
For the reasons set forth below, we DENY the appeal of the denial of the protest.


FACTS

        On February 18, 1993, DCPS issued the RFP for the procurement of real estate advisory
services to facilitate the centralization and relocation of DCPS administrative offices by
September 1995. (Agency Report, Tab A; Protest Exhibit 2V The successful offeror was to
act in the capacity as an agent for DCPS in the solicitation and evaluation of proposals for the
construction of new DCPS headquarters. The RFP letter stated, in pertinent part:

         Contract award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is most advantageous
         to the D.C. Public Schools. D.C. Public Schools reserves the right to reject a
         proposal at anytime [sic] after the closing date for proposal submission and

                                                                      -2-                Shannon & Luchs, CAB No. P-415

                  conduct negotiations to the extent that the D.C. Public Schools deems necessary
                  and appropriate.

         (AR, Tab A; PEx. 2).

                Section IV of the RFP set out the evaluation criteria and selection procedure. (ld.).
         Section 4.4 advised offerors that the evaluation process would focus on two areas: technical
         merit and financial cost. (Id.). Section 4.3, labeled "ACCEPTABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE
         PROPOSALS," stated, in part:

                  Any proposal deemed unacceptable will be rejected by DCPS. Rejection in its
                  broadest terms means that DCPS identified other proposals more responsive to its
                  relocation project. ...

         (Id.). Section B of the RFP set out SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS. Paragraph 8 of Section B stated:

                  An award will be made to the offeror whose proposal is determined to be in the
                  best interest of the D.C. Public Schools. The D.C. Public Schools reserves the
                  right to reject any proposal at any time after the closing date, to conduct
                  negotiations to the extent D.C. Public Schools deems necessary and appropriate,
                  and to make an award without further discussion and negotiations.

         (Id.).  Section F set out the GENERAL PROVISIONS and contained the TERMINATION ('3),
         CHANGES (14), DISPUTE AND PROTEST PROCEDURE (17), and INDEMNIFICATION (,8) clauses.
         (Id.). Paragraph 21 (d) and (e) of the GENERAL PROVISIONS advised offerors that the Rules of
         the District of Columbia Board of Education, Title 5, D.C. Municipal Regulations ("DCMR"),
         Section 3700, et seq. and the DCPS Procurement Procedure Manual, as amended ("PPM") were
         incorporated by reference in the RFP. (Id.).2

                  Section 3704.5 of 5 DCMR provides:

                  The award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined
                  in writing to be the most advantageous to the school system, taking into
                  consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the Request for
                  Proposals.

         Section 3-203.27 of the PPM states:

                  The Procurement Officer shall make a written determination showing the basis
                  on which the award was found to be most advantageous to the School System
                  based on the factors set forth in the Request for Proposal.

Section 3-203.19 of the PPM, entitled "Discussions with     o fferors" , states, in pertinent part:
       Discussions are held to promote understanding of the School System's
       requirements and the o fferors, proposals and to facilitate arriving at a contract
       that will be most advantageous to the School System, taking into consideration
       price and the other evaluation factors set forth in the Request for Proposal.

Section 3-203.20, entitled "Conduct of Discussions," states, in pertinent part:

       Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any
       opportunity for discussions and revisions of proposals. The Procurement Officer
       should establish procedures and schedules for conducting discussions ....

       Section 3-300 of the PPM is entitled "CANCELLATION OF SOLICITATIONS: REJECTION OF
BIDS OR PROPOSALS." Section 3-300.2 provides for cancellation of solicitations in accordance
with procedures set forth in the manual and the rules of the Board of Education. Section 3-
300.7 provides the authority and bases for rejection of bids or proposals after opening but prior
to award. Section 3-300.10 specifically refers to proposals and states, in pertinent part:

       Proposals need not be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction,
       and the School System's stated requirements may be revised or clarified after
       proposals are submitted. This tlexibility must be considered in determining
       whether reasons exist for rejecting all or any part of a proposal. Reasons for
       rejecting proposals include but are not limited to: ...

       (b)    The proposal ultimately . . . fails to meet the announced
              requirements of the School System in some substantive respect; or

       (c)    The proposed price is clearly unreasonable.

        On March 19, 1993, S&L submitted its response to the RFP. (AR, Tab B~ PEx. 3). It
was one of three offerors which responded. DCPS rejected as late one of the offers. (AR, Tab
E, Ex. 1). On June 1, 1993, DCPS issued Addendum No.1 to the RFP. (AF, Tab B; PEx.
3). The addendum deleted paragraph 3.3.1 to the Scope of Work in its entirety and added new
paragraph 3.3.1, which in effect changed the requirement for solicitation and evaluation of
proposals for construction of new DCPS headquarters to assistance in drafting an RFP for
renovation of existing school buildings to serve as new DCPS headquarters. (ld.). Section 3.2.7
of the Scope of Work was also changed accordingly. (ld.). S&L acknowledged and submitted
a formal response to Addendum No.1 on June 9, 1993. (ld.).

       DCPS evaluated protestor's and the other remaining offeror's proposals on June 16,

         1993. (AR, Tab C).3 By memorandum dated July 8, 1993, the Director, Presidential
         Relocation Team recommended to the contracting officer, with the concurrence of the
         Superintendent of Public Schools ("Superintendent"),4 that a contract be awarded to protestor.
         (PEx.4). By letter dated Augu..;t 27, 1993, the contracting officer submitted a proposed contract
         to S&L for its review and comments. (PEx. 6). Therein, the contracting officer stated, "Based
         upon your comments a date will be set up for further negotiations.          "(Id.). He sought
         S&L's comments within five working days. (Id.).

                 On September 1, 1993, S&L responded to the August 27 letter and stated, in part, "We
         are confident that a mutually beneficial agreement can be negotiated between the D.C. Public
         Schools and Shannon & Luchs for the provision of real estate advisory services." (AR, Tab E,
         Ex. 5).

                 On September 20, 1993, counsel for S&L submitted to counsel for DCPS a "Marked to
         Show Changes" copy of the proposed contract. (PEx. 7). Approximately two months later, on
         November 19, 1993, DCPS counsel transmitted to S&L counsel a re-draft of the proposed
         contract which "substantially modified" S&L's earlier version. (PEx. 8). DCPS made it clear
         that the document represented "the starting point for negotiations." (Id.).5 By letter dated
         December 6, 1993, S&L counsel sent to DCPS counsel four executed copies of the agreement,
         "revised to reflect the changes required by [his] client." (PEx. 9).

                By letter dated December 14, 1993, the Legal Counsel, DCPS, informed S&L counsel
         that the "substantial and material modifications" made to the proposed agreement were
         unacceptable. (PEx. 10). SpecificaJly, Legal Counsel noted that the most significant change
         involved S&L's increased fee. Additionally, Legal Counsel stated:

                 Several other issues that D.C. Public Schools' staff felt concensus [sic] had been
                 reached, in discussions with you, regarding provisions that DCPS as a public
                 entity must have in the contract, apparently have now been reversed . . . .

         (Id.). She went on to note that time was of the essence and that if S&L was interested in a last
         effort to reach a consensus on issues raised by the modifications, its counsel should contact
         DCPS by December 16, 1993. (Id.).

                 Apparently, counsel for the parties communicated with each other on December 16; and


             3Sect ion 4.1 of the RFP advised offerors that DCPS would estahlish an evaluation team to select the successful
         offeror. (AR, Tab A; PEx. 2).

             4See Memorandum dated July 8, 1993, from Franklin L. Smith, Superintendent of Schools, to Nate Bush,
         Chairperson, Committee on Facilities Improvement and Maintenance (PEx. 5), advising of Smith's intent to award
         a contract to S&L.                                                                           .

             SOn September 30, 1993, DCPS notltied the only other offeror that S&L had heen determined to be the most
         responsive responsihle offeror. (AR. Tah E, Ex. 4).
                                                                                                                   [5975]



                                                           -5-              Shal/1I01l & Luchs, CAB No. P-4IS


by letter dated December 21, 1993, S&L counsel sent, infer alia, a "Marked to Show Changes"
copy of the proposed contract. (PEx. 11). By letter dated January 14, 1994, DCPS counsel
submitted a final draft of the proposed agreement to S&L counsel. (PEx. 12). Therein, he
advised S&L that the offeror's compensation remained the most outstanding issue. Thereafter,
on February 7, 1994, S&L representatives met with the Superintendent and members of his staff
to discuss the proposed agreement. (PEx. 13). It appears that after this meeting, DCPS
prepared another "final draft" of the proposed agreement and forwarded it to S&L. 6 On March
10, 1994, the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of S&L executed what was "hopefully the final
contract" and forwarded it to the Superintendent. (PEx. 16).7

        On March 30, 1994, the DCPS Procurement Officer notified protestor (and its counsel)
that the RFP had been cancelled in the best interest of DCPS. (AR, Tab E, Ex. 6; PEx. 1).
The cancellation was based upon the unacceptability of the contract terms proposed by S&L,
including its compensation proposal. Additionally, the Procurement Officer advised S&L that
it could "appeal" the cancellation in accordance with the" DISPUTE AND PROTEST" provision of
the GENERAL PROVISIONS of the RFP. (Jd.).


THE PROTEST

        By letter dated April 12, 1994, S&L submitted a protest to the Procurement Officer,
which challenged the propriety of the cancellation of the RFP, on the basis that DCPS aIlegedly
failed to negotiate in good faith the contract that had already been awarded to S&L. By letter
dated May 16, 1994, the Procurement Officer denied the protest and advised S&L of its right
to appeal the denial to the Superintendent of Schools. (AR, Tab E, Ex. 7). S&L appealed the
denial of the protest on May 25,1994; and on June 15,1994, the Superintendent denied S&L's
appeal and advised that it could appeal that denial to the Contract Appeals Board. CAR, Tab E,
Ex. 8). On July 14, 1994, S&L appealed the denial of the protest to the Board. R

        In its protest, S&L claims that DCPS acted in bad faith and with a lack of commitment
to complete and execute the contract which had been awarded to S&L on July 8, 1993, and that
cancellation of the RFP was, therefore, improper. It seeks to have DCPS award the contract




    6Somt!lime in February 1994, counsel for S&L's proposed construction manager appeared on the scene. The
role of the construction manager was resolved, but Its function entailed additional costs and deVelopment of new
contract terms.

    7ApparentIy, S&L's counsel was unaware of the action taken by the CEO; tix he was attempting to finalize the
contract between the partie!s afte!r the! CEO had e!xecute!d it. (PEx. 15).

    RAs a re!sult of the! characterization of the! protest as an appeal at the! time of tiling, the! Board erronoously

dockett!d the! prote!st as an appeal of a contract dlspult:. On August 3, 1994, the! Board re!alizt!d its error and advist!d
the partie!s accordingly.

         to it or compensation for all proposal preparation and negotiation costs and expenses, including
         attorney's fees.

                 In its response to the protest appeal, DCPS asserts that the appeal should be dismissed
         as a result of S&L's failure to submit a clear and concise statement of the legal and factual
         grounds for the protest, in accordance with Rule 302.1 of the Board's Rules of Practice.
         Alternatively, DCPS asserts that the appeal should be denied because the evidence of record
         substantiates the propriety of the cancellation on the basis of the parties' inability to agree on
         final contract terms after seven months of good faith negotiations.

                Protestor did not respond to the agency report. 9


         DISCUSSION

         DCPS' Motion to Dismiss

               DCPS argues that protestor's claims should be dismissed because of the alleged failure
         to comply with Rule 302.1(c) of the Board's Rules. That rule requires that a protest contain

                [a] clear and concise statement of the legal and factual grounds of the protest,
                including copies of the relevant documents and citations to statutes, regulations
                or contract provisions claimed to be violated.

         In support of its position, DCPS asserts that the August 17, 1994, statement of the protest,
         which incorporates the original April 12, 1994, protest (including exhibits) to the Procurement
         Officer contains unsubstantiated allegations of agency wrongdoing and is equivalent to a
         piecemeal approach of presentation specifically rejected by the Board in our decision in U.S.
         Sprint Communications Co., I P.O. 33 (D.C. CAB 1987).

                In our decision in American Vicforian Renovarors, CAB No. P-323, July 21, 1992, 40
         OCR 4473, we stated that Rule 302.1 contemplates a statement which is sufficient to inform the
         Board and the contracting agency of the specific aspects of the procurement to which the
         protestor objects, rather than a simple disagreement with not having received an award. Thus,
         in order for a protest to be legally sufficient, it must provide, at a minimum, either allegations
         or evidence, if uncontroverted, to establish the likelihood of protestor's assertion of improper
         agency action. See Chesapeake Bus & Equipment Company, CAB No. P-404, June 30, 1994,
         7 P.O. 5887; A/ascom, Inc.-ReClJn., B-250407, May 26, 1993, 93-1 CPD 1 411; Renic

        Based on the record before us, we conclude that the protest meets the requirements of
Rule 302.1(c). Here, protestor objects to the manner in which negotiations were conducted and
to the cancellation of the RFP, allegedly in the face of a binding agreement. In support,
protestor submitted exhibits to show the numerous iterations of the proposed agreement and the
parties' respective replies and concerns in a chronological and articulate fashion. As a result,
neither the Board nor DCPS need speculate as to the bases for the protest against allegedly
improper agency action. Moreover, there is nothing "piecemeal" about protestor's claims in that
the protest grounds presented to the Board in a timely manner are the same as those presented
to the Procurement Officer and Superintendent. 10 Consequently, DCPS' motion to dismiss the
protest is DENIED.


Contract Formation

       In its appeal of the denial of the protest, S&L makes several allegations to the effect that
DCPS awarded a contract to it on July 8, 1993. In support, it cites two memoranda dated July
8, one from Shelton E. Lee to Kalyan Rose (PEx. 4) and one from Franklin L. Smith to Nate
Bush. (PEx. 5). In footnote 5 of the DCPS legal response, DCPS argues that a contract was not
awarded to protestor because DCPS had not complied with the proper regulatory procedures for
making an award. (PPM,            **
                                3-203.26 and 3-203.28). DCPS asserts that because none of the
required events occurred, the parties were unable to enter into a contract.




     IODCPS appears to hase Its argument regan.ling protestor's alleged piecemeal approach on the fact that the
"Notice of Appeal" onglnally tiled with the Board did not set forth the hase," t<lr the protest and that it was not until
after the Board notitied the parties of its error that the grounds t<lr the prote!".t hecame known. (See fn. 7). A
review of the "Notice of Appeal" ~hows that protestor may have heen confu!".ed hy the DCPS with respect to the
procedures to be followed. For example, in her March 30, 1994, notice of cancellation, the Procurement Officer
advised S&L that it could appeal the cancellation in accordance with the DISPUTE AND PROTEST provision of the
RFP. (AR, Tah E, Ex. 6). Similarly, In her May 16, 1994, denial of the protest, the Procurement Officer advised
S&L that it could appeal her decision to the Superintendent, who ~uhsequently advised S&L that it could appeal his
decision to the Board. (ld., Exs. 7 and 8).

          In addition, section 3714.4 of 5 DCMR provides that appeals from the decision of the procurement officer
shall be in accordance with sections 3713.4 through 3713.9. Those sections specifically cover procedures for
contract disputes for which the Board requires a detailed statement of the clalill after a notice of appeal has been
tiled. (27 DCMR § 104). Compare wirh RFP, GENERAL PROVISIONS, , 7(b) and (c), which refers to appeals or
protests separately and delineates separate proCedures for each type of action. Thu;., it appears that protestor may
have been confused by all of the references to an "appeal" and acted accordingly, thereafter submitting a statement
of its claim, at the Board's request, once it was apprised of the proper procedures. This is not the type of
"piecemeal" approach that is uMlally r~iected by bid prote;,t trihunals. See, e.g., Acker Electric Company,

                 Paragraph 8 of Section B of the RFP provided that award would be made to the offeror
         whose proposal was determined to be in the best interest of OCPS. However, OCPS specifically
         reserved the right to, infer alia, conduct negotiations to the extent deemed necessary and
         appropriate. Negotiations (or discussions) with offerors are for the purpose of facilitating arrival
         at a contract that would be the most advantageous to OCPS. (PPM, § 3-203.19). Additionally,
         5 OCMR § 3704.5 provides:

                The award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined
                in writing to be the most advantageous to the school system, taking into
                consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the Request for
                Proposals. (emphasis added).

         In compliance with the regulation, the PPM provides that in order for an appropriate award to
         occur, the Procurement Officer must make a written determination showing the basis on which
         the award was found to be most advantageous to OCPS. (PPM, § 3-203.27).

                 The facts of the instant matter show that none of the regulatory requirements were met
         to effect a proper and binding contract award, for no formal contract award documents were
         ever prepared or executed by OCPS. See DeMarr('o Consrrucrion Co. v. Un ired Srares, 600 F .2d
          1384 (CL Cl. 1979); D&S Universal Mining, IIlC., B-200815, August 31,1981,81-2 CPO,
          186; A.B. Machine Works, Inc., B-187563, September 7,1977,77-2 CPO, 177.

                 In addition, the facts show that as far as OCPS was concerned, negotiations had not been
         completed because matters relating primarily to S&L's compensation proposal remained
         outstanding as late as March 1994. (AR, Tab E, Ex. 6; PEx. 1) As the Comptroller General
         said in D&S Universal Mining, Inc.:

                In order for a binding contract to result, the contracting officer must
                unequivocally express an intent to accept an offer. Also, the acceptance of a
                contractor's offer by the government must be clear and unconditional; it must
                appear that both parties intended to make a binding agreement at the time of the
                acceptance of the contractor's offer. (citation omitted).

         In view of the fact that negotiations were ongoing, there is no evidence of an unequivocal intent
         on the part of OCPS to accept the protestor's offer.

                 Finally, the conduct of the parties demonstrates that contrary to S&L's position, protestor
         clearly recognized that no contract award was made on July 8, 1993, or at any time thereafter.
         First, in its September 1, 1993, response to the contracting officer, S&L acknowledged that an
         agreement would have to be negotiated. (AR, Tab E, Ex. 5). Second, the two memoranda on
                                                                                                                  [5919]

which S&L places great emphasis were clearly internal communications among OCPS
officials. II Third, both memoranda evince only an intent (or recommendation) to make a
contract award. Fourth, from the time OCPS sent the first iteration of the proposed contract to
protestor, both parties consistently referred to the documents (collectively) as a "proposed
agreement" or "draft agreement." (PExs. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 14). Finally, as late as March
10, 1993, the protestor expressed "hope" that a final agreement would be executed. (PEx. 16).
Taken together, these facts contravene any conclusion that a binding agreement between the
parties came into being. See Northpoint Investors, B-209816, May 17, 1983,83-1 CPO, 523.


Propriety of the Cancellation

        Protestor claims that the OCPS cancellation of the RFP, based upon S&L's proposed
compensation. was improper and demonstrated DCPS' lack of good faith and commitment to
negotiate the terms of the contract in a fair and honest manner. In support of its position, S&L
points to the evidence of extensive and protracted negotiations between the parties, during which
DCPS allegedly changed contract terms without notice and consultation and allegedly failed in
its commitment to execute a contract already awarded.

        Section 3-203.20 of the PPM makes clear that " [0] fferors shall be accorded fair and equal
treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussions and revisions of proposals .... " This
policy is derived from the government's basic obligation, implied in any procurement, to fully
and honestly consider bids and proposals. Healrh Services Marketing and Development
Corporation, B-241830, March 5, 1991,91-1 CPO 1247. See also D.C. Code § 1-118l.3
(Supp. 1992). In the context of a negotiated procurement, the contracting officer has broad
discretion in deciding whether to cancel a solicitation and need only have a reasonable basis for
doing SO.12 Xactfx Corporation, B-247139, May 5, 1992,92-1 CPO, 423; Health Services
Marketing and Development Corporarion, B-241830; Technical Management Services

CAB No. P-301, October 22, 1992,40 OCR 4647, 4654, fn. 6 (in a negotiated procurement,
agency must have a reasonable basis to support cancellation of an RFP).



    IIThat protestor could heheve that the July 8, 1993, memorantla con:,tltutetl a contract award strains credulity
and is unreasonahle in that neither memorandum was ewn adtlressed to protestor or its representatives, much less
indicates an actual award to the protestor.

    l::-rhere is a distinction hetween the standards reqllJred for cancellation of an Iflvitation for hids and that required
for cancellation of an RFP. In formally advertisetl procurements, "cogent anti compelling reasons" are required
to support a cancellation. Sl'(' First Federal COI]}()rllfioll, CAB No. P-311, Septemher 4, 1992, 40 OCR 4520;

                In addition, the Comptroller General has upheld the cancellation of a solicitation as
         proper and not indicative of bad faith where extensive discussions were held, which led the
         agency to believe that it could not obtain a reasonable price. E.g., Xactex Corporation, B-
         247139; Koba Associates, B-213501.

                 The record shows that between August 27, 1993, and March 10, 1994, the parties
         exchanged numerous iterations of the proposed contract, many of which concerned protestor's
         attempts, as DCPS puts it, "to redefine the scope of services by reducing S&L's contractual
         responsibilities and liability under the proposed contract." (AR, Agency Response, p. 8).
         Additionally, throughout negotiations, S&L attempted to modify or eliminate several standard
         contract provisions, e.g., TERMINATION, CHANGES, DISPUTE AND PROTEST PROCEDURE and
         INDEMNIFICATION clauses. Finally, and significant! y, S&L' s compensation proposal remained
         excessive throughout the negotiations; and the parties' failure ultimately to agree on the
         protestor's compensation led to rejection of its proposal and cancellation of the RFP. In this
         regard, we find the DCPS actions to be reasonable under the circumstances and clearly in line
         with its regulations, the provisions of the PPM (§ 3-300.10) and the terms and conditions of the
         RFP.

                 When a protestor alleges bad faith on the part of government officials, it bears a heavy
         burden and must show, by irrefutable proof, that the officials had a specific and malicious intent
         to injure the protestor. Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377, April 15, 1994, 7 P.D.
         5811; Washington Family Services Associafes, Inc., CAB No. P-368, June 17,1993,41 DCR
         3481; Eaton-Kenway, B-212575, June 20, 1984, 84-1 CPD , 649; Koba Associates, B-213501.
         We will not attribute prejudicial motives to procurement officials on the basis of inference or
         supposition and will not find a discretionary action to be arbitrary, capricious or biased if the
         record indicates a reasonable basis for the action. Id.

                 The record amply demonstrates that the parties engaged in difficult and lengthy
         negotiations, with primary emphasis on proposed changes to the standard contract provisions,
         scope of work and protestor's compensation proposal. Considering that payment of excessive
         costs would not be in the best interest of DCPS and that such costs were the basis for the
         rejection of S&L's proposal and cancellation of the RFP, we can find no impropriety in DCPS'
         actions.13 Accordingly, we find that protestor has not made the requisite showing for bad faith
         to warrant our reversal of DCPS' actions. Washington Family Services Associates, Inc.,
         CAB No. P-368.

                 Because we have found no arbitrary, capricious or bad faith action on the part of DCPS
         as a result of our conclusion that the RFP was properly cancelled, we must reject S&L's claim
         for proposal preparation costs. A. B. Machine Works, Inc., B-187563. 14


             13Compare "COMPENSATION" or "CONSIDERATION AND PAYMENTS" clauses in PExs. 3, 6, 7, 8,9, 12 and 16.

             14Even if we ~ad determined that DCPS' actions were taken   In   bad faith. the Board has no authority to award
         attorney's fees. D.C. Code § 1-1189.8(e)(2) (Supp. 1992).
                                                                                          [5981]




                                              - 11 -        Shannon & Luchs, CAB No. P-4 I 5

         In sum, we find that DCPS' rejection of protestor's offer and cancellation of the RFP
after extended, but fruitless, good faith negotiations were reasonable. - Accordingly, based on
all of the facts and circumstances, and the authorities cited herein, the appeal of the DCPS denial
of the protest is DENIED.
