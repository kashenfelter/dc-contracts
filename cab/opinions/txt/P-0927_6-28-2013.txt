                                                               Filing ID #53066054

        This protest concerns Solicitation No. DCKA-2012-R-0018 (the “Solicitation” or “RFP”)
which was issued by the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (“DDOT” or
“District”) for a contractor to provide asset management services for parking meter assets in the
District. An offeror to the Solicitation, World Wide Parking, Inc. (“WWP” or “protester”) has
alleged that DDOT (i) conducted an improper debriefing; (ii) issued a flawed Solicitation; (iii)
did not comply with District law in evaluating WWP’s proposal; and (iv) failed to “act in the
best interest of the District”1 by entering into negotiations with the highest-ranked offeror.

        The Board rejects protester’s arguments for the following reasons: (i) an inadequate
debriefing is not, by itself, a valid protest ground; (ii) protester’s allegations concerning
improprieties in the Solicitation are untimely; (iii) DDOT evaluated the offeror technical
proposals reasonably, and in accordance with District law; and (iv) pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-
354.03(h)(1) and (2), a contracting officer may decide to enter into negotiations with the highest-
ranked offeror and such decision shall not be subject to review by the Board. Finding that the
District did not violate procurement laws or regulations, we deny the instant protest.

                                                               BACKGROUND

I.            The Solicitation

       On November 21, 2011, the District issued the Solicitation for a “Performance Based
Asset Management Contract” to manage and operate over 14,000 parking meters2 in the District,
along with the related systems and assets. (Agency Report (“AR”) 4-5.) The Solicitation
contemplated the issuance of a five year “performance-based contract with payment based on

    See generally Protester’s Comments on the AR 2-11.

    These parking meters collectively manage over 18,000 parking spaces. (AR 5.)
                                                                              World Wide Parking, Inc.
                                                                                     CAB No. P-0927
 
firm fixed prices (FFP) and firm fixed unit prices (FFUP).” (AR at Ex. 1, § B.2.) There were
nine amendments to the RFP between the time when it was originally issued and the deadline for
receipt of initial proposals on February 13, 2012. (See generally, AR at Ex. 2, § L.12.)

        The RFP required the awardee to undertake responsibility for managing, maintaining, and
repairing virtually all parking meters in the District — a system which “generates roughly $30M
[per year] in revenue.” (AR at Ex. 1, § B.) The District expected “to increase the size of the
system to 20,000 meters as part of the Asset Refresh” and anticipated that the successful
contractor would “collect coins and process virtual transactions for the parking meters.” (Id.)
Specifically, the RFP stated that the contractor would be expected to:

                Proactively maintain all parking meter assets
                Collect all physical payments
                Process virtual payments
                Respond to all service requests
                Manage input into the Parking Meter Management System
                Interface with the District’s Maintenance Management System
                Provide near real time data to the District
               (Id.)

       In addition, the District was “interested in pursuing a replacement of existing mechanical
meters with newer technology.” (Id.) The District therefore wanted prospective bidders to be
capable of implementing improvements “such as dynamic pricing.” (Id.) As described in Section
C.5.2 of the RFP:

               Dynamic pricing is the ability to change the rate for parking based
               on the level of availability. The fewer spaces available, the higher
               the rate charged per hour. Dynamic pricing represents a valuable
               tool in managing parking spaces as a resource and helping to
               ensure the availability of parking spaces within the District.
               (AR at Ex. 1, § C.5.2.)

       The Solicitation required offerors to provide the District with two options: (1) an offer
where existing mechanical meters are replaced with connected meters – the System Refresh; and
(2) an offer that does not involve upgrading assets at the start of the contract and instead
upgrades assets in batches – No System Refresh. (AR at Ex. 1, § B.4.)

       With respect to award criteria, the RFP stated, “[t]he contract will be awarded to the
responsible Offeror whose offer is technically acceptable to [DDOT], and offers the best value to
the District as determined by the total overall score from the evaluation criteria. . . .” (AR at Ex.
1, § M.1.) In evaluating the proposals, the following Technical Rating Scale was to be used:

                                                               deficiencies which may be correctable.

                                                               correctable.
              4                  Good                          Meets requirements; no deficiencies.

(AR at Ex. 1, § M.2.)

        The technical evaluation consisted of rating each offeror’s proposal utilizing the
following     factors:    (1)    Technical     proposal     (40    points     maximum),        (2)
Staffing/Management/QC/QA/Past Performance/Facilities proposal (30 points maximum), and
(3) Price proposal (30 points maximum). (AR at Ex.1, § M.3.) However, in order for a proposal
to be considered technically acceptable, the Technical proposal needed to receive at least 60% of
the available 40 points, and the Staffing/Management/QC/QA/Past Performance/Facilities
proposal needed to receive at least 60% of the available 30 points. (Id.) Significant to Past
Performance was “[t]he extent to which the Prime Contractor’s and subcontractor’s experience
and past performance on asset preservation, maintenance, and management [of] contracts of
comparable size demonstrates a likelihood of successfully performing all of the tasks set forth in
[the] RFP.” (AR at Ex. 1, § M.4.2.A.1.)

        Section M.4.3 of the Solicitation required an objective evaluation of the price proposal.
The offeror with the lowest cost/price would receive the maximum price points. All other
proposals would receive a proportionately lower total price score. (AR at Ex. 1, § M.4.3.) The
RFP also stated that the Technical Evaluation Panel (“TEP”) would check price proposals to
evaluate price reasonableness. (AR at Ex. 1, § M.3.)

        Lastly, up to 12 preference points could be awarded to businesses certified pursuant to
the Small, Local, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Development and Assistance Act of
2005.3 (AR at Ex.1, §§ M.4.5, M.5.) In all, an offeror could receive a cumulative total of 112
points. (AR at Ex.1, § M.4.6.)

II.           The Evaluation Process

     Two responsive bidders submitted proposals by the RFP’s due date of February 13,

Company (“Xerox”).4 (AR at Exs. 2, 3.) Pursuant to Section M.3 of the Solicitation, the District
used the TEP to conduct the initial evaluation of proposals which took place on March 1-2, 2012.
(AR 5, ¶ 4.) The initial evaluations were followed by the offerors’ oral presentations on March
9, 2012. (AR 6, ¶ 5.)

     A. Deficiency Letters

        On March 15, 2012, Mr. Jerry M. Carter, the Contracting Officer (“CO”), issued
Requests for Clarification to WWP and Xerox. (AR at Exs. 6(a), 6(b).)5 Each offeror was
instructed to provide a “Performance Plan” describing how they would “monitor the parking
meter system to ensure that the Performance Measures are met.” (Id.)

        In his letter to WWP, the CO expressed concern that WWP’s proposed Parking Meter
Management System (“PMMS”) did not currently exist6 and that that created “a risk to success
in the District’s evaluation.” (AR at Ex. 6(a), at 2.) The CO’s letter included a request that
WWP “[d]escribe in detail the functionality of the Dynamic Pricing system” being offered. (AR
at Ex. 6(a), at 3.) Therefore, WWP needed to provide details about its past experience with asset
management systems, including how the PMMS would be started, whether WWP had a
contingency plan in the event that the PMMS was not completed on time, and how WWP would
otherwise mitigate the risks identified by the CO. (AR at Ex. 6(a), at 2.)

        In its 35-page response to the deficiency letter, on March 23, 2012, WWP provided
DDOT with additional details on its proposed PMMS. However, WWP’s response did not
appear to dispute that a full version of its proposed PMMS was not yet in existence. WWP
stated that “[t]he central components of the PMMS do exist today [sic] are being used by many
of [subcontractor] CYIOS clients.” (AR at Ex. 7(a), at 10.) Notably, although WWP’s response
described CYIOS Corporation’s (“CYIOS”) successful past performance, WWP did not directly
address whether it had a contingency plan – notwithstanding the CO’s request for the
information – in the event that its PMMS was not timely completed. (Id.)

     B. RFP Amendments and 1st BAFOs

         On May 3, 2012, the CO sent letters to both offerors requesting that each submit revised
proposals (“1st BAFOs”) to the District on or before May 11, 2012. (AR at Exs. 8(a), 8(b).) Each
letter included a list of deficiencies still present in the recipient’s proposal. (Id.) In the letter to
WWP, the CO noted that although WWP had provided extensive information about the past
performance and capabilities of subcontractor CYIOS, its previous response “did not sufficiently
convey the Worldwide Team’s ability to develop a [PMMS] and have it in place within the 90
days allowed under the contract.” (AR at Ex. 8(a), ¶ 2.) Specifically, the CO expressed concern
that none of the subcontractors had experience related to parking meter assets and, further, that

  On October 15, 2012, Xerox moved to intervene in the instant protest pursuant to Board Rules 100.2(k) and (l).
(See Mot. for Leave to Intervene.) The Board granted Xerox’s motion on October 19, 2012. (Order Granting Mot. to
Intervene.)
5
  In the AR, these documents are described as “deficiency letters.” (AR 6, ¶ 6-7.)
6
  This finding is seemingly consistent with WWP’s initial proposal which stated that WWP “in conjunction with
CYIOS Corporation . . . will develop a Parking Meter Management System (PMMS).” (AR at Ex. 2, § 1.1.)


                                                               4 
                                                                                          World Wide Parking, Inc.
                                                                                                 CAB No. P-0927
 
WWP’s proposal had also failed to establish that WWP itself had experience with the use of a
PMMS. (Id.) The CO requested that WWP provide specific details by addressing a list of
deficiencies including items related to performance, resources, and design. (Id.)

       Concurrent with the May 3, 2012, request for 1st BAFOs, the CO issued Amendment 10
to the RFP. (AR at Ex. 8(e).) Amendment 10 replaced the previous pricing workbooks in the
RFP, updated the parking meter financial data, and eliminated the requirement that proposals
meet certain minimum levels of technical acceptability. (Id.) It also moved the Contract Line
Item Numbers (“CLINs”) for parking space sensors from System Asset Refresh to Dynamic
Pricing with a capability of adjusting the meter pricing in 15 minute increments. (Id.)

        On May 9, 2012, the CO issued Amendment 11 to the RFP. (AR at Ex. 9.) Amendment
11 extended the deadline to submit 1st BAFOs to May 16, 2012, and responded to additional
questions from the offerors concerning the dynamic pricing program.7 (Id.) The CO explained
that the “solicitation requires offerors to determine the appropriate number of sensors for the
installation to enable dynamic pricing.” (Id.) However, “sensors are not the only means of
gathering data for dynamic pricing, but rather one element in the solution.” (Id.)

       On May 11, 2012, the CO issued Amendment 12 to the RFP. (AR at Ex. 10.)8
Amendment 12 clarified that the Solicitation did not call for 100% sensor coverage; however,
even though “existing assets were not required to be retrofitted with sensors,” an offeror could
choose to do so. (Id.) Therefore, offerors were “expected to propose a dynamic pricing solution
that met the District’s requirements and best met their capabilities and proposed technology.”
(Id.)

       WWP and Xerox each submitted timely 1st BAFO responses. (AR at Exs. 11(a), 11(b).)
The TEP then evaluated the offerors’ 1st BAFOs on or about May 25, 2012. (AR 7, ¶ 13; AR at
Ex. 12.)

     C. 2nd BAFOs

         On June 7, 2012, the CO sent letters to the offerors requesting that they submit another
Best and Final Offer (“2nd BAFO”), taking into account RFP Amendments 10-12. (AR at Exs.
13(a), 13(b).) As before, the CO’s letters included a list of deficiencies that had been identified
in the recipient’s 1st BAFO. (Id.) In the case of WWP, in order to correct the noted deficiencies,
the CO required WWP to submit: (1) detailed resumes and letters of commitment for WWP’s
subject matter experts; (2) a plan to implement all elements of dynamic pricing pursuant to the
RFP’s requirements; (3) letters of commitment from proposed vendors; (4) a contingent lease
letter from the proposed facility; and (5) all “Asset Breakdown Sheet” items. (AR at Ex. 13(a).)

       By contrast, the CO’s letter to Xerox identified fewer deficiencies. It required Xerox to
provide additional information such as: (1) an analysis on the purchase of any extended
                                                            
7
  The CO indicated that traffic disincentive and increasing parking turnover were among the stated goals of the
dynamic pricing program. (AR at Ex. 9.)

  The Board notes that in the electronic filing index, AR at Ex. 10 is erroneously labeled as “Amendment 11” instead
of “Amendment 12.”

warranties; (2) letters of commitment from proposed vendors; and (3) a contingent lease letter
from the proposed facility. (AR at Ex. 13(b).)

       On June 11, 2012, the CO issued Amendment 13 to the RFP. (AR at Ex. 14.) This
amendment provided clarification concerning the data entry for the pricing workbooks, and for
the CLINs for electronic locks. (Id.) It did not however, extend the deadline for receipt of the
2nd BAFOs. (Id.) Accordingly, both offerors submitted their 2nd BAFOs by the due date of June
14, 2012. (AR at Exs. 15(a), 15(b).)

         The TEP evaluated the 2nd BAFOs on or about June 19, 2012. (AR 7 ¶ 17; AR at Ex. 16.)
Although following its initial evaluation of WWP’s proposal, the TEP had concluded that WWP
“had extensive on-street expertise,” the TEP found that WWP’s 1st BAFO and 2nd BAFO failed
to mitigate the risks identified by the CO in the WWP deficiency letters. (AR at Ex. 17, at 2.) In
addition, the TEP was not persuaded that WWP “understood the work effort related to either the
parking meter management system (PMMS) or Dynamic Pricing.” (Id.) The TEP further noted
that, in its 2nd BAFO, WWP failed to price any parking sensors as required by the RFP and that
such omission rendered WWP’s pricing proposal “non-compliant” and therefore, in effect, “the
actual price to the District would be higher.” (Id.)

       On June 20, 2012, the TEP chair conveyed via memorandum to the CO, the TEP’s
recommendation that Xerox was the highest-ranked offeror. (AR at Ex. 17.) The final technical
and price score calculations are as follows:

*Worldwide Parking did not price any sensors in its 2nd BAFO.
(AR at Ex. 17, at 2.)

        The CO signed his acknowledgement of the TEP’s recommendation on June 28, 2012.
(AR at Ex. 17, at 4.) He also sent letters to WWP and Xerox notifying them of their ratings. (AR
at Exs. 18, 19.) The CO then began negotiations with Xerox, the highest-rated offeror, pursuant
to D.C. Code § 2-354.03(h).9 (AR at Ex. 25.) The District has not made a contract award under
the Solicitation. (AR 11.)

III.          Debriefing and Protest

        On August 3 and August 31, 2012, WWP requested a debriefing. (AR at Ex. 20.) The
debriefing was held on September 13, 2012. (AR at Ex. 22.) On September 24, 2012, WWP
timely filed the instant protest with the Board.10 (Protest.) WWP’s initial protest grounds are as
follows:

                             (1) WWP conformed to the essential requirements of the RFP.
                             (2) The District did not fairly evaluate WWP’s past performance
                             and technical capability given its experience with the existing
                             contract as a subcontractor.11
                             (3) WWP offered a substantially lower price—approximately $50
                             million—than Xerox, yet the Contracting Officer did articulate
                             [sic] in the debriefing how Xerox was technically superior to
                             justify making the award to Xerox.
                             (4) The Dynamic Pricing issue was constantly changing throughout
                             the procurement process and, therefore, should not have been a
                             basis for evaluation.
                             (5) WWP demonstrated in its proposal superior management
                             capability.
                             Taken together, the DDOT Contracting Officer’s decision was in
                             error, arbitrary and contrary to the facts and law, and not in the
                             best interest of the District.
                             (Protest 5.)

   D.C. Code §2-354.03(h) states, in relevant part, “(1) After ranking the prospective contractors, the contracting
officer may elect to proceed with negotiations in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection. The contracting
officer's decision shall not be subject to review. (2) If the contracting officer elects to proceed with negotiations, the
contracting officer shall negotiate with the highest-ranked prospective contractor on price or matters affecting the
scope of the contract, so long as the terms of the final contract are within the scope of the request for proposals.”
10
   On February 8, 2013, the protester requested that the Board permit it to engage in discovery. During a telephone
status conference with the parties on March 7, 2013, we held that WWP had failed to show that discovery was
necessary to aid the Board in a just resolution of the protest. See Carter Fuel Oil Co., CAB No. P-0208, 39 D.C.
Reg. 4263, 4267 (July 12, 1991) (“[t]he purpose of discovery is to aid the Board in a just resolution of the protest,
not to enable a protestor to conduct a fishing expedition so as to develop the grounds of its protest”). Accordingly,
the Board denied protester’s discovery request.
11
    During its performance as the incumbent asset manager to the District, Xerox has retained WWP as its
subcontractor. (WWP’s Comments 5.)


                                                               7 
                                                                                            World Wide Parking, Inc.
                                                                                                   CAB No. P-0927
 
Following its review of the AR, WWP synthesized its allegations into three main protest
grounds: (1) the agency debriefing was inadequate; (2) the evaluation of protester’s proposal was
not fair and reasonable and did not comply with District law; and (3) DDOT did not act in the
best interest of the District. (Protester’s Comments on the AR (hereinafter “WWP’s
Comments”) 1-2.)

                                                               DISCUSSION

Board Jurisdiction

       We exercise jurisdiction over this protest and its underlying allegations pursuant to D.C.
Code § 2-360.03(a)(1) (2011).

I.            An Inadequate Debriefing is Not a Valid Protest Ground

        WWP argues that DDOT delivered an inadequate debriefing which therefore “raises
questions of the fairness and equitable treatment of WWP during the evaluation process.”
(WWP’s Comments 2.) However, an inadequate debriefing does not, by itself, constitute a valid
protest ground since a debriefing has no bearing on the District’s source selection activity.
Rather, a debriefing is, by definition, a post-source selection activity. The Government
Accountability Office (“GAO”) (which the Board finds to be persuasive authority)12 has
similarly held that, “the adequacy and conduct of a debriefing is a procedural matter that does
not involve the validity of” a contract award. Eggs and Bacon, Inc., B-310066, 2007 CPD ¶ 209,
n.4 (Comp. Gen. Nov. 20, 2007) (citing Healthcare Tech. Solutions Int’l, B-299781, 2007 CPD ¶
132 at 5 (Comp. Gen. July 19, 2007); see also Thermolten Tech, Inc., B-278408, 98-1 CPD ¶ 35
at *4 (Comp. Gen. Jan. 26, 1998) (holding, in part, that “the purpose of a debriefing is not to give
offerors the opportunity to cure deficiencies for the instant procurement, but to furnish the basis
for the selection decision and contract award”). Accordingly, the Board denies WWP’s protest
ground concerning the alleged inadequacy of its debriefing.

II.           WWP’s Protest Ground Concerning the Solicitation Is Untimely

        WWP further contends that the Solicitation contained multiple flaws. These alleged flaws
include improper and/or confusingly-formatted pricing workbook templates, and an inconsistent
and poorly-defined approach to dynamic pricing. (See generally, WWP’s Comments 3-10.)
Specifically, the protester states that “the District did not clearly set forth in Amendment 10 what
elements of the two option workbooks would be combined to produce the final price in each
workbook.” (WWP’s Comments 3.) As such, “WWP asserts that the calculated results in the
workbooks are not trustworthy [in] that they cause confusion.” (Id.) In considering these
allegations, the Board notes that these purported improprieties would have been apparent to
protester as soon as it reviewed the RFP.

                                                            
12
  See Potomac Techs., Inc., 36 D.C. Reg. 4045 at 4052, 1989 WL 508650 (DC CAB Feb. 13, 1989) (“[w]hile the
Board is not bound by the decisions of the Comptroller General, this large body of federal government contracting
law is frequently helpful and persuasive when we are confronted with similar factual situations”). In addition, “[t]he
protest authority and procedures of this Board were patterned on those of the GAO.” In re Prison Health Servs.,
Inc., CAB No. P-0610, 48 D.C. Reg. 1503, 1507 (Mar. 16, 2000).


                                                                   8 
                                                                                        World Wide Parking, Inc.
                                                                                               CAB No. P-0927
 

        However, the Solicitation expressly states that, “[a] protest based on alleged
improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent prior to proposal opening or the time set for
receipt of initial proposals shall be filed with the Board prior to proposal opening or the time set
for receipt of initial proposals.”13 (AR at Ex. 1, § L.7.) Therefore, protest grounds concerning
any alleged improprieties in the RFP needed to be asserted prior to February 13, 2012, the
deadline for receipt of initial proposals. This requirement applies equally to any amendments to
the Solicitation whereby protest grounds concerning improprieties in an amendment need to be
filed prior to the time set for receipt of the corresponding proposals or BAFOs. In Capitol Entm’t
Servs., Inc., CAB No. P-0932, 2013 WL 2453772 (May 22, 2013), we held that two protest
grounds were untimely because they were based on Amendment 2 to the Solicitation yet the
protest was filed more than a month after BAFOs were due. See also, West Group, CAB No. P-
0612, 48 D.C. Reg. 1550 (June 8, 2000) (holding that where a solicitation with a submission
deadline of June 22, 1999, had been cancelled then reissued with a revised deadline of January 7,
2000, the deadline for filing a protest based on an alleged solicitation impropriety was January 7,
2000, the date for submission of revised proposals). The Board finds that WWP’s protest ground
pertaining to the terms of the Solicitation, and any amendments thereto, is untimely.

III.          The District Fairly and Reasonably Evaluated Protester’s Proposal

       WWP alleges that the “evaluation of WWP’s proposal was not fair and reasonable and
did not comply with District law.” (WWP’s Comments 3.) Specifically, WWP argues that the
CO and the TEP erred in their analysis of WWP’s proposed PMMS and that “[i]n proposing to
use CYIOS, WWP offered the District an exceptionally qualified firm that was [experienced in]
implementing complex computer database services. . . .” (Id. at 6.)

       However, as the Board explained in Health Right, Inc., “[i]n determining the propriety of
an evaluation decision, we examine the record to determine whether the judgment was
reasonable and in accord with the evaluation criteria listed in the solicitation and whether there
were any violations of procurement laws or regulations. Health Right, Inc., D.C. Health Coop.,
Inc., & The George Washington Univ., CAB Nos. P-0507, P-0510, P-0511, 45 D.C. Reg. 8612,
8636 (Oct. 15, 1997) (citing Halter Marine, Inc., B-255429, 94-1 CPD ¶ 161 (Mar. 1, 1994); Sw
Marine, Inc., B-265865, 96-1 CPD ¶ 56 (Jan. 23, 1996); Biochemical Genetics, CAB No. P-
0470, 44 D.C. Reg. 6795 (Feb. 25, 1997)).

       Upon reviewing the record in the instant case, the Board finds that there has been a valid
exercise of judgment by the CO14 and, therefore, we will not “substitute our judgment for that of
the [CO].” See Health Right, CAB Nos. P-0507, P-0510, P-0511, 45 D.C. Reg. at 8637.
Although the protester alleges that the CO merely “adopted the evaluation results of the TEP”
without conducting an independent evaluation of the proposals, the record indicates otherwise.
The CO indicated his own review of the offeror proposals in the March 15, 2012, deficiency


                                                            
13
  See D.C. Code § 2-360.08(b)(1); CAB Rule 302.2(a).
14
  The TEP presented its finding to the CO who acknowledged its receipt for his further review and final selection.
(AR at Ex. 17, at 4.)


                                                               9 
                                                                                            World Wide Parking, Inc.
                                                                                                   CAB No. P-0927
 
letters to the offerors.15 (See AR at Exs. 6(a), 6(b).) Furthermore, the offerors had substantial
discussions with the District over the course of many months—including oral presentations—in
addition to extensive correspondence between the CO and the offerors concerning the contents
and deficiencies of the offerors’ proposals. The CO also regularly amended the Solicitation to
address questions and feedback that he received from WWP and Xerox.

        The Board acknowledges that although the CO signed the TEP’s evaluation, there is no
contemporaneous documentation of the CO’s decision to adopt the TEP’s recommendation.16
However, a substantial body of contemporaneous evidence reveals a CO who was engaged
throughout the conduct of this procurement with both the offerors and the TEP. Accordingly, the
facts of the instant protest are readily distinguished from those in Health Right where we found
that the contracting officer merely “adopted” the (poorly-documented) evaluation of a technical
evaluation board (“TEB”).17 Health Right, Inc., CAB Nos. P-0507, P-0510, P-0511, 45 D.C.
Reg. at 8637. In that case, the record did not show any discussion between the District and the
offerors, any discussion between the contracting officer and the TEB, and there was no final
evaluation/selection report by the TEB. (Id.) Therefore, contrary to our findings in the present
case, in Health Right we held that the CO could not have made a valid exercise of judgment
when she “adopted” the evaluation results of the TEB. (Id.)

        Lastly, the CO informed the protester of a number of deficiencies in its proposal. (AR at
Exs. 6(a), 13(a).) Indeed, the CO stated that protester’s PMMS created “a risk to success in the
District’s evaluation.” (AR at Ex. 6(a), at 2.) Yet, WWP failed to correct the identified
deficiencies and failed to comply with the CO’s request to provide a contingency plan in the
event that its proposed PMMS was not timely developed. In its 2nd BAFO, the protester even
failed to list pricing for the sensor installation,18 an item which was central to the District’s
interest in dynamic pricing. Together, these concerns reasonably formed the basis for WWP’s
lower ranking. Finding no evidence that any procurement laws or regulations have been violated
during the evaluation of the offeror proposals, the Board denies this protest ground of WWP.

IV.           A Contracting Officer’s Decision to Begin Negotiations with the Highest-Ranked
              Offeror is Not, by Itself, Reviewable by the Board

       The protester alleges that the CO did not act in the best interest of the District when he
began negotiations with Xerox, the highest-ranked offeror, particularly since WWP’s proposed
price was $50 million lower than Xerox’s. However, the Solicitation makes clear that price
alone would not serve as the basis for contract award. Indeed, the Solicitation indicated that an

                                                            
15
   The CO’s letters state, “[i]n review of your submission for the Asset Management Services . . .” (AR at Exs. 6(a),
6(b).)
16
   In his declaration, the CO simply states that he “took the recommendation of the TEP.” (AR at Ex. 25, ¶ 26.)
17
    The facts of the instant protest serve to distinguish it from other protests sustained by the Board due to a
contracting officer’s abdication of its responsibilities in clear violation of procurement law. See, RideCharge, Inc.,
CAB No. P-0921, 2012 WL8021681 (Nov. 9, 2012) (holding that the single document produced by the contracting
officer during the evaluation process was insufficient to substantiate his decision to exclude all but one offeror from
the competitive range); Citelum DC, LLC, CAB No. P-0922, 2013 WL1952320 (Mar. 1, 2013) (sustaining the
protest because, in part, the District failed to even identify the contracting officer responsible for conducting the
procurement).
18
   See AR at Ex. 15(a)(1), at 7.


                                                               10 
                                                                                            World Wide Parking, Inc.
                                                                                                   CAB No. P-0927
 
offeror’s technical proposal was the most important factor in DDOT’s best value analysis by
allocating a total of 70 points (~63%) for technical capability and 30 points (~27%) for pricing.
Furthermore, WWP did not include pricing for sensors in its 2nd BAFO; therefore, the actual
price to the District would have been higher. (AR at Ex. 17, at 2.)

       Besides, the CO’s decision to enter into negotiations with Xerox is not reviewable by the
Board, pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-354.03(h). In relevant part, § 2-354.03(h)(1) states that a
contracting officer’s decision to enter into negotiations with the highest-ranked offeror on
matters concerning price and the scope of the contract “shall not be subject to review.” The
Board also notes that WWP remains eligible for award should the CO’s negotiations with Xerox
conclude unsatisfactorily.19 Therefore, the Board denies WWP’s protest ground regarding
DDOT’s contract negotiations with Xerox.

                                                               CONCLUSION

        For the reasons set forth herein, we hold that (i) protester’s allegations concerning the
inadequacy of its debriefing do not constitute a valid basis for protest; (ii) protester’s arguments
concerning the terms of the Solicitation are untimely; (iii) the District’s evaluation of protester’s
proposal was fair, reasonable, and in accordance with District law; and (iv) the CO’s decision to
enter into negotiations with the highest-ranked offeror is not reviewable by the Board pursuant to
D.C. Code §2-354.03(h). Accordingly, the present protest is denied.

SO ORDERED.
