    PROTEST OF:
        REMCO BUSINESS SYSTEMS, INC. OF
          WASHINGTON                                               CAB No. P-131
        Under IFB No. 88-0159-AA-4-0-CC

                                               DECISION

        On September 19, 1988, Remco Business Systems,                 Inc. of Washington
    (hereinafter Remco)       filed a protest with this Board alleging that the
    solicitation referenced above, issued by the Department of Public Works,
    was violative     of     the   D.C.   Procurement     Practices Act     of 1985      (PPA)
    because,    in effect,    it was unduly restrictive of competition, thwarted
    competitive bidding and resulted in a sole source procurement.
        The District of Columbia (District) in response has filed a motion to
    dismiss this protest on the ground that Remco lacks standing to protest
    since the company is not an "actual or prospective bidder or offeror" as
    required by the PPA, D.C. Code, sec. 1-1189.3 (1987 Replacement).
        The District points out that the solicitation was expressly limited
    to sheltered market bidders who have been issued a registration certifi-
    cate by the D.C. Minority Business Opportunity Commission, as authorized
    by the Minority contracting Act,             D.C. Code, sec.      1-1148 (1987 Replace-
    ment), and that Remco was not a certified minority business enterprise.
        The District's argument is well taken.            The principle of law
    involved is that a bid on a sheltered market solicitation by an uncer-
    tified     minority    contractor     is    nonresponsive   for   failure    to meet     a
    material term of the solicitation, in accordance with sec. 1-1181.7(41).
    This principle has been adopted in this jurisdiction in Am. Combustion v.
    Minority Business opportunity Commission,              441 A.2d 660,        671-72   (D.C.
                                 - 2 -

1982) .    In accord, see Aceves Construction and Maintenance Co., 1 P.D.
50,53 (D.C. CAB 1987).
    Inasmuch as the solicitation at issue was sheltered and Remco was not
a certified minority firm at the time of bid opening, we conclude that it
cannot be an actual or prospective bidder for this procurement.    Remco,
therefore, lacks standing to protest.
    Remco's alternative argument that it acquired standing because it was
a potential supplier of goods to an actual       or potential bidder is
rejected.     Manufacturers and suppliers who are not actual or potential
bidders lack standing to challenge bid solicitations.   See In the Matter
of: Pacific Allied Products, Ltd., B-220181, 220182, October 18, 1985 85-
2 CPD para. 424); and In the Matter of: ADB-ALNACO, Inc., B-218541, June
3, 1985, 85-1 CPD para. 633.
                                   ORDER

    For the reasons set forth above, the Board grants the District of
Columbia's motion to dismiss.
    This protest is DISMISSED.
