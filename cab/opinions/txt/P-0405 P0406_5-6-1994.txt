                                OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS

                    These consolidated protests of Commando K-9 Detectives, Inc. ("Commando"), and
            Executive Security & Engineering Technologies, Inc. ("Executive"), challenge the awards made
            to Eastern Shield Security Systems Inc. ("Eastern ") and Dow Associates, Inc. ("Dow") in
            Contract Nos. 3185-AA-03-8-DW and 3185-AB-03-8-DW by the District of Columbia's
            Department of Administrative Services ("DAS"). The protesters principally argue that Eastern
            and Dow should not have received award because they did not obtain the required licenses and
            permits until after bid opening or contract award. The District has moved to dismiss on the
            ground that Commando and Executive lack standing to protest the awards because neither
            protester would be next in line for award even if the protests were sustained. We grant the
            District's motion and dismiss the protests.

                                                 BACKGROUND

                   On October 15, 1993, DAS issued Invitation for Bids ("IFB") No. 3185-AA-03-8-DW
           in the small business set-aside market for security guard services. (Agency Report ("AR") Ex.
           1). Bids were opened on November 15, 1993. There were nine bidders: Commando, Eastern,
           Executive, Dow, B&B Security Consultants, Inc. ("B&B"), Atlas International Security, Inc.
           ("Atlas"), Aimats Corporation, Smith Security, and Combat Security Force, Inc. ("Combat").
           (AR Ex. 2).

                  The IFB contained four aggregate award groups for the provision of security guard
           services. Special Condition 11 of the IFB specifies that awards were to be made so that
           generally no more than two aggregate award groups were awarded to anyone bidder. Special

                                                           _2 -    CAB Nos. P-40S &; P-406, Conunando K-9 Detectives, et aI.



            Condition 11 also provides that aggregate groups will be awarded based on the evaluated bid
            price for each aggregate group. (AR Ex. 1, at 37-38).

                   Dow was the low bidder for each of the four aggregate award groups. Eastern was the
            second low bidder for each of the four aggregate award groups. On March 7, 1994, DAS
            awarded Contract No. 3185-AB-03-8-DW to Eastern for aggregate award groups 2 and 4. (AR
            Ex. 3). On March 18, 1994, DAS awarded Contract No. 3185-AA-03-8-DW to Dow for
            aggregate award groups 1 and 3. (AR Ex. 4).

                   On March 17, 1994, Commando filed its protest (CAB No. P-405) with the Board
            challenging the award to Eastern on the basis that Eastern allegedly did not have, at the time of
            bid opening, proper state licenses required by the IFBY Commando was the eighth low bidder
            on aggregate award group 2 and seventh low bidder on aggregate award group 4. (AR Ex. 2).

                    On March 29, 1994, Executive filed its protest (CAB No. P-406) with the Board
            challenging the award to Dow on the basis that Dow was not properly licensed and that Dow
            should not have received an enterprise zone evaluation preference because it allegedly is not
            located in an enterprise zone. Executive was the seventh low bidder on aggregate award groups
            1 and 3. (AR Ex. 2).

                    By order dated April 4, 1994, the Board consolidated the two protests for purposes of
            further proceedings. The District timely filed a motion to dismiss the protests on April 18,
            1994. Neither Commando nor Executive has responded to the District's motion.

                                                     DISCUSSION

                    Only aggrieved persons have standing to protest agency award decisions. In order to
            have staDding, an actual or prospective bidder or offeror must show that it has suffered, or will
            suffer, a direct economic injury as a result of the alleged adverse agency action. District of
            Columbia v. Group Insurance Administration, 633 A.2d 2, 18-19 (D.C. 1993). A protestor
            lacks standing where it would not be in line for award, even if its protest were upheld.
            Unfoldment, Inc., CAB No. P-358, Sept. 17, 1993, 6 P.D. 5399, 5401-02. The record
            demonstrates that neither Commando nor Executive would be in line for award even if their




               11 Section   vn   of the IFB's specifications, entitled "Licenses Permits and Regulations",
            provides:

                            The contractor(s) shall possess all licenses and permits necessary
                            for the performance of this contract, in accordance with all
                            pertinent laws and regulations of the District of Columbia, of the
                            United States and the State of Maryland, if applicable.

             CONCURRING:




                Y Although we do not reach the protesters' arguments on the merits, we note that a provision
            like Section vn of this IFB's specifications, requiring a prospective contractor to obtain a
            specific license or pennit, generally involves the issue of a bidder's responsibility rather than
            the responsiveness of a bid because it relates to the ability of the successful bidder to perform.
