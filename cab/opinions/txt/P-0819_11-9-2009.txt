                                           Filing ID 27962129


       Configuration has protested the contracting officer’s determination that its bid was
nonresponsive and the award made to Maryland Office Interiors, Inc. We conclude that
Configuration’s bid was not responsive as it failed to meet the solicitation’s salient
characteristics. Accordingly, we deny the protest challenge of the nonresponsiveness
determination and dismiss the remaining grounds for lack of standing.

                                         BACKGROUND

        On June 5, 2009, the Office of Contracting and Procurement (“OCP”), on behalf of the
Office of Property Management, renamed the Department of Real Estate Services, issued IFB
No. DCPO-2009-B-0020 for a requirements contract, which included a fixed price component
consisting of an order for furniture for the Waterfront project. (Agency Report (“AR”) Ex. 1).
The IFB sought a contractor to furnish and deliver to District agencies various systems furniture
and case goods ordered from a manufacturer’s price list (Part I) and to furnish and install systems
and case goods at the Waterfront located at 1100 and 1101 4th Street SW (Part II) based in part
on the prices in Part I. IFB Exhibit F set forth a table containing the salient characteristics of the
furniture. (AR Ex. 1).

        By Amendments 0001 through 0004, OCP changed the pre-bid conference date from
June 26, 2009, to June 19, 2009, clarified the closing date, responded to written questions, and
revised IFB Section J.1.1 (Part I) and J.1.2 (Part II). Amendment 0004 also required bidders to
submit unit prices for standardized case goods (Attachment J.1.2 Part I, Case goods and Systems
Furniture Pricing for 48 items). By Amendment 0005, dated June 26, 2009, the District, among
other things, inserted Section J.1.13, Exhibit A, requiring bidders to submit a fixed price for the
Waterfront Project. In addition, Amendment 0005 stated “Evaluation of proposed furniture and
fixtures shall be a comparison of the item bid and its match to the salient characteristics as
specified in Exhibit F.” By Amendments 0006 through 0008, the District responded to questions
and revised Exhibit A, responded to a written question, and extended the closing date to July 27,
                                                -2-              Configuration, Inc., CAB No. P-0819


2009. By Amendment 0009, dated July 8, 2009, the District revised the closing date to July 15,
2009. (AR at 3-4; AR Ex. 1).

        On July 15, 2009, the following eight bidders submitted timely bids: American Office,
Configuration, F.A. O’Toole Office Systems, Inc., Dynamic Business Interiors (“DBI”),
Maryland Office Interiors (“MOI”), Capital Services and Supplies, Inc, Motir Services, and
Standard Business Furniture. (AR Ex. 7). The bid opening officials (a program specialist and
contract specialist) noted on the original “Goods and Services Bid Abstract Form” dated July 16,
2009, that the prices for American Office, MOI, F.A. O’Toole, and Motir Services were “not in
compliance.” (Protest, Attachment 2). There is no precise indication in the record regarding
why the bid opening officials believed MOI’s bid prices to be “not in compliance.” However,
after the contracting officer reviewed all eight bids, the contracting officer determined that
MOI’s prices were in compliance with the solicitation requirements. Configuration fails to
identify any aspect of MOI’s bid that fails to meet the IFB’s requirements. In accordance with
the IFB as amended, the contracting officer evaluated the bids based on the fixed price
component in Part II and the ability of each bidder to meet the technical requirements. The
contracting officer prepared a Bid Tabulation Sheet based on the prices submitted for the
Waterfront Project Part II. (AR Ex. 8 and 9).

        By a Determination and Findings for Award to other than the Lowest Bidder dated July
28, 2009, the contracting officer determined that bids of American Office and Configuration
were not responsive. Configuration had submitted with its bid a six-page list entitled “DC
Waterfront Furniture Deviation List” describing how the Configuration proposed furniture items
deviated from the salient characteristics required by the IFB. (District Response to Comments
on the Agency Report, Ex. A). Specifically, the contracting officer determined that 20 items of
furniture in Configuration’s price schedule failed to meet the salient characteristics set forth in
the Attachment F of the IFB. (AR Ex. 10). We find that the following furniture items proposed
by Configuration materially deviated from the solicitation’s salient characteristics:

   Item (Description)         Salient Characteristics               Deviation

   32 Training Table          frosted opaque modesty panel          fabric modesty panel
   34 Café Table              36” square                            29” x 36” rectangular
   36 Training Table          frosted opaque modesty panel          fabric modesty panel
   37 Conference Table        boat shape, wood legs                 rectangular shape, drum base
   39 Training Table          frosted opaque modesty panel          fabric modesty panel
   42 Conference Table        48” diameter                          36” diameter
   43 Conference Table        54” diameter                          36” diameter
   47 Conference Table        boat shape, wood legs                 rectangular shape, drum base

       Based on his July 28 determination of nonresponsiveness of the two low bidders
(American Office and Configuration), the contracting officer determined that the award must go
to MOI, the next lowest responsive and responsible bidder. On August 10, 2009, the contract to
MOI was deemed approved by the Council. (District Response to Comments on the Agency
Report, Ex. B).

       On August 28, 2009, Configuration filed with the Board its bid protest which was
docketed as CAB No. P-0819. On September 11, 2009, DBI filed with the Board another protest
which was docketed as CAB No. P-0823. Subsequent to the filing of the protests, the
contracting officer prepared a revised bid tabulation sheet, dated September 21, 2009, which
confirmed the following order of bidding and the award to MOI:

(AR Ex. 14). On September 23, 2009, the District filed its motion to dismiss and agency report.
By letter dated October 1, 2009, the District terminated for convenience Part I (Case Goods and
Systems Furniture) of MOI’s Contract No. DCPO-2009-C-0020, as part of a settlement of DBI’s
protest in CAB No. P-0823, and DBI thereafter withdrew its protest. On October 2, 2009,
Standard Business Furniture intervened in CAB No. P-0819. On October 6, 2009, Configuration
filed its comments on the agency report. In its response, Configuration protested the District’s
termination of Part I of the MOI contract which would lead the District to rebid the citywide
requirements requested in the solicitation. Configuration also protested the failure of the District
to timely notify it of the July 28 nonresponsiveness determination and provide Configuration an
opportunity to “address the alleged failures of its bid.” Configuration also contends that
“[t]hough the IFB solicited ‘brand name [Kimball] or equal’, the IFB was written in such a
manner, and the award granted in such an irregular manner, that Kimball dealers were unduly
favored for no legitimate reason.” On October 15, 2009, the District responded to the new
protest grounds raised by Configuration.

                                          DISCUSSION

       We exercise jurisdiction over this protest pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03 (a)(1).

        Configuration raises four principal grounds for protest: (1) whether the District properly
determined Configuration nonresponsive and therefore not in line for award; (2) whether the
District’s award to MOI conformed to law; (3) whether the District conducted a proper public
bid opening; and (4) whether the Council approved the proposed contract to MOI.

        If the District properly determined that Configuration’s bid was nonresponsive, then it is
not in line for award and therefore lacks standing to raise the other challenges with respect to the
award to MOI. C.P.F. Corp., CAB No. P-0521, Jan. 12, 1998, 45 D.C. Reg. 8697, 8699 (the
Board will not consider protests by bidders who are not next in line for award if the protest is
sustained). To be responsive to a brand name or equal solicitation requirement, a bid offering an
equal product must conform to the salient characteristics of the brand name product listed in the
solicitation. Advance Medical Systems, Inc., CAB No. P-0202, April 1, 1992, 39 D.C. Reg.
4516, 4518; Trail Equipment Co., B-241004, Feb., 1, 1991, 91-1 CPD ¶ 102. A bidder must
submit with its bid sufficient descriptive literature to permit the contracting officer to assess
whether the proposed equal product meets all of the salient characteristics specified in the
solicitation. Id. A bid which materially deviates – that is, one which affects in more than a
trivial way, the price, quality, or quantity of goods or services offered – from the salient
characteristics must be rejected as nonresponsive. Id.; Parsons Precision Products, Inc., B-
249940, Dec. 22, 1992, 92-2 CPD ¶ 431.

        Based on our review of the record, it is clear that the District properly determined that
Configuration’s bid was nonresponsive because the bid expressly and materially deviated from a
number of salient characteristics specified in Exhibit F of the solicitation. Configuration’s “DC
Waterfront Furniture Deviations List” submitted with its bid consists of a spreadsheet listing
furniture items being proposed by Configuration and how those items deviate from the furniture
items listed in the bid at Attachments A and F. In determining Configuration’s bid
nonresponsive, the contracting officer focused on a subset of the deviating products by
comparing how Configuration’s proposed items deviated from the Attachment F salient
characteristics of the bid items. Configuration’s bid for furniture items 32, 34, 36, 37, 39, 42, 43,
47, and 57 clearly deviate from the salient characteristics and Configuration admits as much in
its October 6 comments on the agency report. In some cases, Configuration states in its October
6 pleading that it “will provide” a conforming item “at no additional cost to the District” and in
other cases it states that it will provide the precise item specified in Attachment A. But
Configuration’s post-bid opening attempts to cure the deviations in its bid are ineffective
precisely because these attempts come after bid opening. In Advance Medical Systems, Inc.,
CAB No. P-0202, April 1, 1992, 39 D.C. Reg. 4516, 4518, we quoted the following from Trail
Equipment Co., B-241004, Feb. 1, 1991, 91-1 CPD ¶ 102: “Responsiveness must be determined
at the time of bid opening, and, in general, solely from the face of the bid and the material
submitted with the bid. To allow a bidder to make its nonresponsive bid responsive after bid
opening is tantamount to allowing the bidder to submit a new bid.” Parsons Precision Products,
Inc., 92-2 CPD ¶ 431 (“A bid which is nonresponsive on its face may not be converted into a
responsive bid by post opening bid clarifications or corrections.”).

        Accordingly, Configuration’s bid was properly determined nonresponsive and it lacks
standing to raise its other challenges to the award. Even if we were to address the merits of
Configuration’s challenges to the award to MOI, we would not sustain the protest grounds.
Configuration failed to demonstrate that the award to MOI violated law, regulation, or the terms
of the solicitation. The record adequately demonstrates that all bids were publically opened, that
MOI’s bid was responsive, and that the Council approved the proposed award to MOI. To the
extent that Configuration challenges the solicitation as being overly restrictive in designating
Kimball furniture, that challenge is untimely.

                                        CONCLUSION

        For the reasons discussed above, we deny Configuration’s challenge of the contracting
officer’s determination that its bid was nonresponsive, and we dismiss its other challenges to the
award for lack of standing.

       SO ORDERED.
