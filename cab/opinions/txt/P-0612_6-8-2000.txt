                                               OPINION

        West Group filed a protest against the terms of a solicitation for publication of the D.C. Code
asserting that the failure of the District to commit itself to provide a list of current subscribers to the
Code effectively restricts competition and unlawfully establishes a sole source procurement. The
District asserts that the protest concerns contract administration not properly considered in a protest.
Alternatively, the District asserts that the protest was lmtimely filed. The Board previollsly
determined that the essence of the protest does not involve issues of contract administration. (Order,
April 11, 2000) The Protester, however, has failed to show that the protest was timely filed.
Accordingly, we dismiss the protest.


                                           BACKGROUND

         On April 21 , 1999, the Office of Contracting and Procurement issued RFP 9054-AA-NS-1-
DW ("RFP") on behalf of the Office of General Counsel of the Council of the District of Columbia.
The RFP solicited proposals for a firm-fixed-price contract to update the mmotated District of
Columbia Code on an annual basis beginning with the year 2000; to prepare, print and bind pocket
part supplements. replacement indexes and replacement volumes; and to market the "official" D.C.
Code in printed and electronic form. (Agency Report ("AR") Exh. 1, Part 1. §B). Amendment 2 to
the RFP extended the closing date for initial proposals to June 22, 1999. (AR Exh. 3). Under the
solicitation, the contractor is to deliver to the District 510 copies of the printed edition of the revised
code. mdex and supplements, (AR Exh. 1, §F.5.1.), and to license the District to use the annotated
code in electronic form (Jd. at Attachment 1.1). The contractor is further required to make the
revised annotated code available for sale to the public in printed (Id. at §C.18.2) and electronic forms
(Jd. at §C. 9), and to provide an unannotated code to the public free of charge on an internet site. (AR
Exh 3, §C.9.5). Under the subject solicitation, as well as previous contracts for publication of the
                                                                                                                                          (7914)

On its face, the revised Iallguage not only docs not 1lleet the ohjections raised by the Protestcr. but
highlights the impropriety raised by the Protester. It could be argued Ii o III the originallallgllagc thaI.
even though the "successful" offeror would not bc known at the time ofsubll1issioll, no oner could
be successful unless the offer had been accompanied by a subscriber's list. By this interpretation.
if the incumbent contractor were to make a proposal, it would have to submit its subscriber list with
its offer. By the amendment, however, the District made it clear tilatno subscription list would be
required of the incumbent contractor unless the incllmbent won the award. After the amendment
there could be no possible readillg of the solicitation to provide that all unsuccessful ofTeror would
he required to submit its subscription list after award to a competitor.' The alleged defect ill the
solicitation about which protester complains was therefore apparent 110 later than June 9, 1999.
Regardless of whether West had been previously led to believe tilat the previous subscription list
would he availahle to any successful contractor, the for III a I writtcn ;lI1lcndll1ent rcmovcd ,lilY
ambiguity. Thus any protest as to the terms or the solicitation !lot filed prior to the next date ('or
submission of proposals. June 22, 1999, is untimely.

        As noted above, West's proposal submitted without protest on June 22, 1999, \vas acceptcd.
and the contract awarded to West on October 14,1999. That contract was subsequently voided and
negotiations reopened. Even ir the reopened negotiation is considered the equivalent or a 11CW
procurement establishing a new time limit ror filing protests of thc terllls or the solicitation. the
subject protest is still untimely. The Determination ami Finding to canccl the illitial West <mard was
made Novemher 30, J 999. (AR Exh. 9). West had previollsly been directed to cease performance
on NoveJ1Jber 17, 1999. (ld) West must have been I'ully aware thaI. inthc over 4 weeks from award
to the notice to cease performance, no subscription list was provided to it contrary to it previollsly
alleged understanding that the suhscription list would be available two weeks (10111 award.

        III Amendment 3 to the solicitation issued December 28, 1999. the Contracting O/licer
established a deadline of Jalluary (), 2000, for submission of revised proposals. The amendment
made certain changes in evaluation criteri;l hut did not ,1Iler the previous terms ,lS to tile subscription
list. On January 5, 2000, Amendment 4 extended the demllille for proposals ami made a further
change in eV81uation procedures. (AR Exh. 1J). NotiJing in the amendments issued by the
Contracting Onlcer in the reopened negotiations responded to the alleged ddiciency ill the
solicitatioll claimed in the Protest. The alleged deficicncy cOlltinued to he apparent. A timely protest
could he fIled no later than January 7, 2000. the date for submission of revised proposals. W'hile
Protester has alleged actions by Lexis Publishing after January 7, 2000, to publish an independent
code (Opposition to Motion to Dismiss, 10), which West claims may make it uneconomic for it to
perrorm the contract if it is awarded 10 iL Protester cites no f~lctS \vhich would make the alleged
solicitation defects apparent whieh were not present prior to January 7, 2000.




          Even if the amended language were as West staled its understanding ill its letter confIrming
          1

 the pre-proposal conference, it is difficult to conceive of how the District could enl(l)Ce any
 requirement on all unsllccessful of1eror arter a contract has been avvarded.
