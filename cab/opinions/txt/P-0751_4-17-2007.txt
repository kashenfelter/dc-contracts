                                              OPINION
                                            Filing ID 14517956

       System “42” Inc., the protester, has challenged a contract award to Garcete Construction
Company for construction of the Ward One Senior Wellness Center, on the ground that Garcete is not
capable of performing the construction work. The District has filed a combined motion to dismiss and
Agency Report, arguing that System “42” lacks standing to protest because it is not certified as a small
business enterprise (“SBE”) in this SBE set-aside procurement, and that on the merits, Garcete was
properly awarded the contract. We conclude that the solicitation was an SBE set-aside procurement and
that System “42” has not demonstrated that it was properly certified as an SBE under District of
Columbia law. Accordingly, we dismiss the protest because System “42” lacks standing.

                                          BACKGROUND

        On November 29, 2006, the Office of Contracting and Procurement (“OCP”), on behalf of the
Office of Property Management (“OPM”), issued IFB No. DCAM-2007-B-0006, for the construction of
a new Ward One Senior Wellness Center. There is a dispute between the parties concerning whether
the solicitation is an SBE set-aside or open market procurement. Centered at the bottom of the title
page for the specifications, there is text in bold font which reads: “OPEN MARKET.” However, at
page 1 of the IFB, in block 6, the text “SBE Set-Aside” is checked while the text “Open Market with set
aside [f]or LSDBE subcontracting” is not checked. Section B.2, entitled “Designation of Solicitation
for the Small Business Set Aside Market Only”, at page 3, states:

       This Invitation for Bids is designated for certified small business enterprise (SBE)
       bidders only under the provisions of the “Small, Local, and Disadvantaged Business
       Enterprise Development and Assistance Act of 2005” (the Act), Title II, Subtitle N, of
       the “Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Support Act of 2005”, D.C. Law 16-33, effective October
       20, 2005, as amended.

       An SBE must be certified as small in the procurement category of Building
       Construction in order to be eligible to submit a bid in response to this solicitation.
                                             -2-                         System “42” Inc., CAB No. P-0751


(Agency Report (“AR”) Ex. 1). System “42” notes in its protest that OCP’s advertising for the
solicitation in the Washington Times Classified Section and at the OCP website both identify the
procurement “Market Type” as “Small Business Enterprise Set-Aside.” (System “42” Protest, at 1; AR
Ex. 10, BCM ¶ 4.2). System “42” never raised any question of an ambiguity in the solicitation being an
open market or set-aside procurement prior to bid opening. OCP opened five bids on January 5, 2007,
with bid prices as follows:

               Bidder                         Price
               CNA                            $1,707,000
               Monument                       $4,351,000
               System “42”                    $4,995,000
               Garcete                        $5,200,000
               FEI                            $6,057,000

(AR at 4).

       FEI, the highest bidder, filed a protest on January 10, 2007, docketed as CAB No. P-0747,
challenging the four lower bids. On January 23, 2007, Garcete filed a protest of the same procurement,
docketed as CAB No. P-0749. Thereafter, OCP determined the bids of System”42” and CNA to be
nonresponsive because neither provided proof of its certification as an SBE by the District of Columbia
Small and Local Business Opportunity Commission (“SLBOC”) as required by the IFB. The District
awarded the contract to Garcete after determining that it was properly certified and was a responsive
and responsible bidder. On February 20, 2007, we dismissed FEI’s protest because FEI voluntarily
requested dismissal and Garcete’s protest was moot in light of the District’s award to it. On February
23, 2007, System”42” filed the instant protest. The District filed its combined motion to dismiss and
Agency Report on March 15, System “42” filed a one-page response on April 3, and the District filed a
reply on April 13, 2007.

                                            DISCUSSION

        Considering the solicitation in its totality, the only reasonable interpretation is that the
solicitation was an SBE set-aside in the procurement category of building construction. Section B.2
clearly places the solicitation in the SBE set-aside market. Block 6 found on page 1 of the solicitation
confirms the fact of the SBE set-aside, as do the newspaper and website advertisements noted by
System “42” in its protest. The “Open Market” label found on the title page of the specifications must
be seen merely as a typographical error in light of the specific solicitation provisions defining the
solicitation as an SBE set-aside procurement. System “42” also argues that it is a “small business” in
accordance with the United States Small Business Administration’s “Small Business and Size
Guidelines.” This argument misses the mark because federal SBA certification is not determinative of
District of Columbia SBE certification by the SLBOC. These certification systems are governed by
their own legislation and regulations. System “42” has provided no evidence that it was, at the time of
bid opening, certified by the District’s SLBOC as an SBE in the procurement category of building
construction. System “42” also relies on certifications it says it has with the Maryland Department of
Transportation, Prince George’s County Minority Program, and the Metropolitan Washington Airport
Authority. These certifications are not relevant to whether System “42” is an SBE (certified by the
                                            -3-                        System “42” Inc., CAB No. P-0751


District’s SLBOC) in the procurement category of building construction. As there is no indication that
System “42” was so certified as a District SBE in the appropriate procurement category, it was not
eligible to bid on this set-aside procurement, and therefore lacks standing to protest. See M&G
Services, Inc., CAB No. P-0652, May 10, 2002, 50 D.C. Reg. 7419. Accordingly, we dismiss the
protest for lack of standing.

                                              CONCLUSION

       For the reasons discussed above, we dismiss the protest of System “42” for lack of standing.

       SO ORDERED.
