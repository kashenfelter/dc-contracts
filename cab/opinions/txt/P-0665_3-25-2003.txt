                                       OPINION and ORDER
                                       (Courtlink Filing ID: 1569284)




        Protester raised substantial issues as to the fairness of handling its two applications for
funding under the Ryan White Title I Regional Grant Request for Proposals. The District,
without responding on the merits, moved to dismiss the protest on the ground that the Board
lacks jurisdiction to consider protests concerning grant awards. The Board agrees with the
District and dismisses the protest.

        Protester’s applications were submitted pursuant to a Request for Applications (“RFA”)
for subgrants of Federal grant funds administered by the District of Columbia.           Had the
protester’s applications been successful, they would have resulted in grant awards (RFA 3) and
not contracts. The Board’s jurisdiction is established and limited by the coverage of the
Procurement Practices Act. D.C. Code § 2.309.03 (2001 ed.). That Act specifically excludes
from its coverage, and therefore from the Board’s jurisdiction, any “contract or agreement
receiving or making grants-in-aid or for federal financial assistance.” Id. § 2-301.04(c). Since
this matter relates to award of a grant, the Board is without jurisdiction. District of Columbia
Local Development Corporation, CAB No. P-0421, Nov. 14, 1994, 42 D.C. Reg. 4885, holding
affirmed, but vacated on other grounds, Jan. 31, 1995, 42 D.C. Reg. 4914.
                                            -2-            Community Health Ministry, CAB No.P-0665




      The protest is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.


      SO ORDERED.
