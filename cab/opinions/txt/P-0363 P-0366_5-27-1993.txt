                                     OPINION AND ORDER

        These consolidated protests challenge the solicitation and award of the above-
captioned Invitation for Bids (IFB) for the renovation of portions of the South Potomac
Building at 613 G Street, N.W., Washington, DCli. Protestor, Tito Contractors, Inc. (Tito),
asserts that the actions of the Department of Public Works (DPW) in cancelling the
solicitation after meeting with all the bidders is without precedent and impugns the integrity
of the sealed bid system. Tito also asserts:

       a.    Contract award was made despite the pending protest CAB P-363
       acknowledged by the Board on February 2, 1993.

       b.      The Government of the District of Columbia violated its own rules by
       making this award namely: Violated of 1619.3(a). The solicitation that was
       issued subsequent to the cancellation of IFB 93-0030-AA-4-N-CC did not
       notify potential offerors that an award would be made without discussion. The
       Contracting Agency did not conduct any discussions before award. Y


  LlThese protests were consolidated by Board Order dated March 10, 1993.

  YThe cited regulation provides:

   1619.3      If discussions are not held pursuant to § 1619.1(b), the following
               requirements shall be met:

               (a)     All offerors must have been notified of the possibility that an award might
                       be made without discussion.
                                                    - 2-              CAB Nos. P·363 & P·366, Tito Contractors, Inc.


       c.     The Contracting Agency issued a Notice to Proceed to the Contractor
       Diamond Construction, Inc. without receiving payment and performance
       bonds from Diamond Construction, Inc. in violation of 2611.1 of Title 27 of
       the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations, and 2703.9 of Title 27.'Ji

       d.     That the Contracting Agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious
       manner and possibly illegal manner by allowing Diamond Construction, Inc.
       a "second bite of the apple".

Tito requests that the IFB be reinstated and that it be awarded the contract as the lowest
responsive and responsible bidder, or, in the alternative, that it be awarded its bid
preparation costs and costs for payment and performance bonds.

       In its agency report concerning the consolidated protests, the District argues that in


  l IThe cited regulations provide:

   2611.1       Each notice of intent to award shall include the following:

                (a)     The identity of the IFB;

                (b)     The prospective contractor's bid;

                (c)     The award price;

                (d)     A statement notifying the prospective contractor that all required
                        performance and payment bonds must be properly executed by the
                        prospective contractor and sureties and returned to the contracting officer
                        by the prospective contractor within the time period specified in the IFB, or,
                        if no time period is specified in the IFB, within ten (10) days after the bond
                        forms are presented by the District to the prospective contractor for
                        signature;

                (e)     A statement notifying the prospective contractor that the required contract
                        form must be properly executed by the prospective contractor and returned
                        to the contracting officer by the prospective contractor within the time
                        period specified in the IFB, or, if no time period is specified in the IFB,
                        within ten (10) days after the District government contract form is presented
                        by the District to the prospective contractor for signature; and

               (f)      A statement that a notice to proceed will be issued, contingent upon the
                        contracting officer's receipt of executed performance and payment bonds and
                        executed contract form that is in compliance with the requirements of the
                        IFB and this title.

                                                   • ••
   2703.9      In construction contracts, the contractor shall furnish all performance and payment bonds (or
               other securities) by the deadline for submitting bonds (or other securities) as stated in the
               solicitation. The bonds (or other securities) must be submitted before a notice to proceed
               is issued.

P-363, the cancellation of the invitation and subsequent negotiation were proper according
to the regulations. With regard to P-366, the District responds that: (a) there is no
requirement that the District delay awarding a contract because a bid protest is filed; (b) the
District did not violate 27 DCMR § 1619.3(a); (c) the District did not violate 27 DCMR §
2611.1; and in view of the solicitation provisions, the question of whether the contractor
submitted performance and payment bonds is a performance issue not within the Board's
jurisdiction; and (d) protestor's final allegation does not comply with Board rules, in that it
is not a clear and concise statement of the factual and legal basis of a ground for protest.

       The Protestor filed comments in opposition to the agency report. The Protestor
argues in its supplemental comments that the District acted in bad faith in cancelling the
IFB because the bids were in a competitive range of one another and in the competitive
range of the government's estimate.


                                   FINDINGS OF FACT

       F.F.1.    On November 19, 1992, the Contracting Officer for DPW made and certified
findings in a Determination and Findings (D&F) for Emergency Procurement to renovate
part of the 8th and 9th, 10th and 11th floors of 613 G Street, N.W., pursuant to D.C. Code
§ 1-1183.12(a)(1) and 27 DCMR § 1710. (Exhibit 1 to Agency Report) .

      F.F.2.     Bid opening was scheduled for December 18, 1992. (Exhibit 3 to Agency
Report).

        F.F.3.    Included in the bid packages was a single sheet entitled "Important Notes",
consisting of five notes including No. 1. which stated:

       "Bidder must submit 5% bid bond. Upon award of contract to the low
       responsive and responsible bidder, he must submit 100% performance and
       50% payment bonds." (Exhibit 4 to Agency Report) .

       F.F.4.   By Addendum No.1, bid opening was postponed, "until further notice."
(Exhibit 5 to Agency Report).

       F.F.5.   By Addendum No.2, bid opening was re-scheduled for January 12, 1993.
(Exhibit 6 to Agency Report).

       F.F.6.   Timely bids were received from four contractors, Tito Contractors, Inc.
(Exhibit 8 to Agency Report), Diamond Construction, Inc. (Diamond) (Exhibit 9 to Agency
Report), Associated Builders, Inc. (Associated) (Exhibit 10 to Agency Report), and MTI
Construction Co., Inc. (MTI) (Exhibit 11 to Agency Report).

      F.F.7.   The government's estimate for the work was $850,000.00. (Exhibit 16 to
Agency Report).
                                             -4-              CAB Nos. P·363 & P·366, Tito Co ntractor.;, Inc.


       F.F.8.   Bids were opened on January 12, 1993, and were as follows:

                     Tito                   $1,100,815.00
                     MTI                    $1,164,000.00
                     Associated             $1,190,000.00
                     Diamond                $1,113,321.00
                                                                (Exhibit 13 to Agency Report).

      F.F.9.    By memorandum dated January 22, 1993, the Director of the Department
of Administrative Services (DAS) stated as follows (in pertinent part):

       I have determined that the bids received are at unreasonable prices and
       should be cancelled pursuant to Section 1530, 27 DCMR. Further, since the
       services are urgently needed, I am requesting that you negotiate with each
       responsible bidder as per Section 1601, 27 DCMR.

       In order to expedite the procurement of these urgently needed services, I am
       suggesting the following schedule:

                o    Negotiations with Bidders              January 26

                o    Contract Award                         January 29

                o    Completion of Renovation               March 12
                                                              (Exhibit 14 to Agency Report).

       F.F.10. Both Protestor and the District agree that prior to cancellation of the IFB,
DPW met with each bidder on January 26, 1993. Each bidder was advised that its bid was
too high and was asked to reveal its cost breakdown. (Protest in CAB No. P-363, p. 2;
Agency Report, p. 4).

       F.F.11. Thereafter on January 27, 1993, DPW issued a Determination and Findings
for the Cancellation of an Invitation for Bids After Opening (D&F). The D&F stated in
pertinent part:


                                             ***

      An evaluation of the bid prices and their comparison with the revised
      government cost estimate of $850,000.00 has revealed that the bid prices are
      unreasonable.

      The Department of Administrative Services, the requesting agency for the
      subject project, in its letter of January 22, 1993, has also indicated that the bid
      prices are excessively high and has requested that the invitation be canceled
      and that the contract be negotiated with the bidders. (see Attachment No.2).

       In order to obtain a more competitive price, it is recommended that this
       invitation be canceled, and in accordance with 27 DCMR, Section 1601, the
       contract be negotiated with each responsible bidder that submitted a bid.
                                                          (Exhibit 15 to Agency Report).

                                            ***
       F.F.12. On January 28, 1993, DPW notified Tito, Diamond, Associated, and MTI
that the IFB had been canceled, and requested best and final offers (BAFO's) by February
3, 1993. (Exhibit 17 to Agency Report).

       F.F.13.   The BAFOs were as follows:

                     Tito                 $ 998,000.00
                     MTI                  $1,012,000.00
                     Associated           $1,016,685.00
                     Diamond              $ 943,265.00
                                                            (Exhibit 19 to Agency Report).

       F.F.14. On February 3,1992, the Real Property Administration, DAS, recommended
that Diamond, the lowest bidder, be awarded the contract. (Exhibit 20 to Agency Report).

       F.F.15. On February 5, 1993, DPW entered into a letter contract with Diamond.
(Exhibit 21 to Agency Report).

       F.F.16. On February 26, 1993, the contracting officer determined that Diamond was
a responsible contractor. (Exhibit 22 to Agency Report).

        F.F.17. On February 26, 1993, Diamond was given its notice to proceed with work,
effective February 8, 1993. (Exhibit 23 to Agency Report).

      F.F.18. The performance and payment bonds of Diamond do not reflect the dates
on which they were presented. (Exhibits 25 and 26 to Agency Report).

      F.F.19. Work was scheduled to be competed by March 22, 1993. (Exhibit 23 to
Agency Report).


                                        DECISION

        The first issue to be addressed is whether the IFB was properly canceled. Protestor
asserts that the District must show that there was a "compelling reason" to cancel the
solicitation after bid opening and cites as support 40 Compo Gen. 671 (1961). However,
Protestor references a standard which does not apply to the solicitation at issue or to
solicitations of the District of Columbia generally. In the decision cited by Protestor, the
Comptroller General is relying on the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) at Part
                                            -6-             CAB Nos. P-363 & P-366. Tilo Conlraclors. Inc.


14.404-1, Cancellation of invitation after opening. The FAR does indeed state that
preservation of the integrity of the competitive bid system dictates that after bids have been
opened, there must be a compelling reason to cancel the invitation. However, the FAR is
not controlling here.

       The District correctly points out that the proper standard here is whether the
cancellation is in the "best interest" of the District government. In this regard, the
Procurement Practices Act of 1985 (PPA) provides as follows:

              An invitation for bids, a request for proposals, or other solicitations
       may be cancelled, or all bids or proposals may be rejected, only if it is
       determined in writing by the Director that the action is taken in the best
       interest of the District government. This information must be forwarded to
       the Inspector General for review within 72 hours of the action.
                                                 (Emphasis added) D.C. Code § 1-1183.7.

The District of Columbia Municipal Regulations for Contracts and procurements set forth
some of the reasons which could justify cancellation of procurements after bid opening:

       An IFB may be canceled and all bids rejected before award but after opening
       when the Director determines in writing that cancellation is in the best
       interests of the District for any reason, including the following:

       (a)    Inadequate or ambiguous specifications were cited in the IFB;

       (b)    Specifications have been revised;

       (c)    The supplies or services being contracted for are no longer required;

       (d)    The IFB did not provide for consideration of all factors of cost to the
              District;

       (e)    Bids received indicate that the needs of the District can be satisfied by
              a less expensive article differing from that for which the bids were
              invited;

       (f)    All otherwise acceptable bids received are at unreasonable prices, or
              only one (1) bid is received and the contracting officer cannot
              determine the reasonableness of the bid price, or no responsive bid has
              been received from a responsible bidder; or

       (g)    The bids were not independently arrived at in open competition, were
              collusive, or were submitted in bad faith.
                                                   (Emphasis added) 27 DCMR § 1530.4.

Finally, this Board has consistently held that where the District has demonstrated that
cancellation was in the best interest of the District, and where the procedural requirements
are adhered to, the cancellation was proper. Systrol, CAB No. 316, 5 P.D. 3058 (November
17, 1992); General Oil Corporation, CAB No. P-155, 38 DCR 2982 (October 17, 1992);
Battery Place, CAB No. P-98, 38 DCR 2796 (June 15, 1989). Having determined the proper
standard for our review, we now consider whether that standard has been met here.

        The reason for cancellation cited by the District is that all bids received were at
unreasonable prices. (F.F. 9 and F.F.ll.) This justification is certainly contemplated as
sufficient by the District's procurement regulations, 27 DCMR § 1530.4(f), supra, and
recognized in case law. Omega Container, Inc., B-206858.2, 82-2 CPD ~ 475 (1982)
(determination of price unreasonableness based upon a comparison of bid prices with, inter
alia, government's estimate); Building Maintenance Specialist, Inc., B-186441, 76-2 CPD ~
233 (1976) (cancellation proper where low responsive bid was only 7.2% greater than
government estimate).

        The Protestor takes issue with the government's estimate of $850,000.00, and argues
that it is unreasonably low. However, we recognize that contracting officers have broad
discretion to determine whether cancellation of an IFB after bid opening is justified, and our
review of that decision is limited to ensuring that the determination was reasonable. Total
Protech Inc., B-233264, Feb. 28, 1989, 89-1 CPD ~ 211. Further, the government's
determination as to unreasonableness of price must be sustained unless there is a showing
of bad faith or fraud . Penn Landscape & Cement Work, B-196352, 80-1 CPD ~ 126 (1980).
In its comments on the agency report, the Protestor asserts that the District has shown bad
faith because the government estimate of $850,000.00 was erroneous in that it reflected no
cost for 14 items from rough carpentry through electrical. (Exhibit 12 to Agency Report).
Protestor further argues that the proper estimate was $1,098,790.00.

       The Board notes that in its Determination and Findings for Cancellation, the Director
of DPW states that the government's estimate for this project was $850,000.00. (F.F.7)
(Exhibit 16 to Agency Report). However, Exhibit 12 to the Agency Report, which is the
estimate of work prepared by Hunter Miller Associates, does not reflect an estimate of
$850,000.00. A telephone conference was held with the parties on Tuesday, May 25, 1993,
at 2:00 p.m. so that an explanation of the information contained in Exhibit 12 could be
provided to the Board. See Board Rule 310, 36 DCR 2714-2715. During the course of that
conference, the District explained that the estimate relied on was a "Contractor Estimate"
which was based on estimates received from contractors who did not bid on the project but
would perform the work for that amount. The amount of that estimate was $859,000.00.
This explanation is consistent with the information in footnote 3 to Exhibit 12. The
"Contractor Estimate" does include costs for the 14 items referenced by the Protestor. With
this explanation, the Board finds the District's determination that the original bids were
unreasonably high to be a reasonable determination.

        We turn now the question as to whether the government complied with the proper
procedural requirements for the cancellation of the IFB. Clearly it did not. Based on the
District's procurement regulations at 27 DCMR § 1601, Negotiation after Cancellation, and
                                                    -8-               CAB Nos. P-363 & P-366, Tito Contractors, Inc.


the written instructions of the Director of Administrative Services, negotiation with the
bidders was to be held after cancellation of the bid_ (EE9_) However, the procurement
regulations and the Director's memorandum of January 22, 1993, were clearly ignored_ It
is uncontested that DPW negotiated with bidders prior to cancellation of IFE. (EE10_)
The procurement regulations were further violated in that negotiations were not held after
BAFO's were received, and potential offerors were not notified pursuant to 27 DCMR §
1619.3(a) that award would be made without discussion_ (See EE13 and EE14_)

       It is further clear that contract award was improper. The letter contract with
Diamond was entered into on February 5, 1993, and Diamond was not found to be
responsible until 21 days later on February 26, 1993. (F.F. 15 and EE 16)_ Clearly this was
improper in that the PPA provides that contracts shall be awarded to responsive and
responsible bidders_ D_C Code § 1183.3(e); 27 DCMR § 1541.1. The District's
procurement regulations further require that award is not to be made until all required
approvals have been obtained_ 27 DCMR § 1541.3_ Thus the District failed to comply with
the PPA and its own regulations in cancelling the IFB and awarding the contract. Having
found that the District failed to follow proper procedures as well as the instructions of the
Director of DAS, the Board finds that the District acted in an arbitrary and capricious
manner; and therefore the first ground of the protest has merit and is GRANTED_

        The other grounds of the protest are not compelling_ Contract award is not
suspended by the filing of a protest with the Board, D_C Code § 1-1189-8(e)(1); and so that
ground of the protest must faiL See Group Insurance Administration, Inc_, CAB No_ P-309,
39 OCR 4491, 1992)_ It is not clear from the record whether or not the District issued a
notice to proceed before it received a payment and performance bond. (EE17 and EElS.)
However, the District's compliance or non-compliance with 27 DCMR 2703_9, supra, is a
matter of contract administration and cannot serve as proper grounds of a protest.

assertion that Diamond was improperly given a "second bite at the apple," the Board finds
that argument without merit. Anytime that an IFB is canceled after bid opening the bid
prices have become public_ However, competition the second time around puts all bidders
on equal footing with regard to the knowledge of the prior bid prices; and all bidders are
given an opportunity to bid at reasonable prices. See Stewart Thomas Industries, Inc.,
B-196295, 80-1 CPO ~ 175_ Thus, these latter grounds of the protest are DENIED.




   ilFailure of a successful bidder to properly execute a payment or performance bond after contract award
is matter of default. Allgood Elec. Co., B-235171, July 18, 1989, 89-2 CPD 1 58, Fn 2. In this regard the
Federal Acquisition Regulation provide at Part 52.228-1(c):

        If the successful bidder, upon acceptance of its bid by the government within the period
        specified for acceptance fails to execute all contractual documents or give a bond(s) as
        required by the solicitation within the time specified, the Contracting Officer may terminate
        the contract for default.

       WHEREFORE, as set forth above, the protest is GRANTED in part, and DENIED
in part. Tito has requested to be awarded its bid preparation costs and costs for payment
and performance bonds. This Board is authorized pursuant to the PPA to award reasonable
bid preparation costs when requested and when the Board finds that the District's actions
toward the Protestor were arbitrary and capricious. D.C. Code § 1-1189.8(e)(2). However,
that is no statutory authority or precedent for this Board to order reimbursement of a
Protestor's payment or performance bonds. As explained above, we find that the District
acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in cancelling the IFB. Therefore, Tito shall be
awarded its reasonable bid preparation costs. D.C. Code § 1-1189.8(e)(2). Koba Associates,
Inc., CAB Nos. P-344 and P-359, 5 P.O. 5036, 5050. March 3, 1993; Agmilu and Company,
Inc., 36 OCR 3993, November 29, 1988; Pinnacle Corporation, 36 OCR 3695, November 18,
1988. Therefore, pursuant to Board Rules 314.5, 314.7, 36 OCR 2717, Tito shall submit
documentation supporting its costs within 20 days of receipt of the Board's decision, and the
District may respond within 10 days.

       So ORDERED.
