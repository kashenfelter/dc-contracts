                                                                                P-0057

                                                        OPINION

                This    protest 1        filed     by     Potomac        Technologies,    Inc.        (PTI)

          challenges        the     rejection        of    its     bid    extension    offer     by     the

          contracting officer for the Department of Administrative Services

          (DAS) .      PTI also protests the subsequent contract award to Haas

          Hardware, alleging that, but for DAS' wrongful rejection of its

          bid, PTI would have been the low bidder and would therefore have

          been awarded the contract under Invitation for Bids No. 7091-AA-

          45-0-7-CW (IFB).

                The subject IFB was               issued by DAS on December 5,                 1986 and

          solicited       in     the   sheltered market             a    lime shaker scrubber           for

          use    by    the       Water    and     Sewer       utility         Administration     of     the



               1This case originated during a period of time when the
          District of Columbia Contract Appeals Board was functioning
          pursuant to Commissioner's Organization Order No.9, D.C. Code,
          Supplement V (1978), as amended by Mayor's Order 82-224, 30 DCMR
          497 (January 28, 1983).     Pursuant to section 1-1189.1 of the
          District of Columbia Procurement Practices Act of 1985, a new
          independent agency denominated as the Contract Appeals Board was
          created.   This new Board became operational on August 1, 1988,
          and succeeded to jurisdiction of all contract dispute cases
          pending before the previously established Board.

       opening occurred on January 8, 1987.                              There were three responses

       to the IFB and PTI was the apparent low bidder.                                   Id. at 2.

             section 11 of the Instructions to Bidders included in the IFB

       provided that, unless a bidder stated a shorter time period, the

      contracting           officer         would       have       sixty   days     from       the   date    of

       opening to accept a bid.                       Id.,    exh.    C at    2.     Sometime in March

       1987, DAS determined that, due to administrative delays, it would

       not     be    able       to    award       a     contract         within     the    specified        bid

       acceptance period.                   Id.   at 3.        A DAS contract specialist then

       contacted the three bidders to request that they submit letters

      extending           their           respective         bid     acceptance          periods     for     an

       additional thirty days.                    This request was communicated to PTI by

       telephone on March 10, 1987.                          Id. at 3 and exh. D.               In response

       to this request, PTI sent to DAS a letter, dated March 13, 1987,

       stating, in relevant part:

             In response to your calion March 10, 1987, PTI is
             pleased to resubmit our quote ... PTI is pleased to provide
             the services indicated on page 5 of 9 of the Invitation
             at the price of $14,67C.76, a 4.5% increase on the
             original price submitted on January 8, 1987.           This
             increase is necessitated by the price increase of the
             supplier, being that more than 60 days have expired since
             bid opening.  Id., exh. D.

             By     letter        dated      March      19,     1987,      DAS     again       requested     an

       extension of             PTI I s    bid    acceptance         period       and,    in    response     to

       PTI's attempt to extend its bid at a higher price, DAS stated:

             It is requested that time for acceptance of your bid be
             extended to April 8, 1987.        In response to your

            extension.          Id., exh. E.

            Both Haas Hardware and Jo-Na corporation responded in writing

     to DAS      I    request,    in which they agreed to extend the acceptance

     period for their respective bids at the original prices.                                See Id.

     at 4 and exh. G .
            By       letter    dated March          27,    1987,      Carl Jones,     President of

     PTI,     responded          to    DAS'     second       request      for   a   bid   extension.

     Regarding its earlier submission of a bid extension at a higher

     price than its original bid, PTI stated:

            Our letter of March 13, 1987 was not an attempt on our
            part to request subject IFB [sic] but in fact a condition
            of extending our prices.    This extension is necessary
            because of the inordinate amount of time it takes to
            award the contracts.    Our suppliers of this equipment
            quoted us their best prices based on terms and conditions
            of the IFB. He can not be expected and is not willing to
            furnish this equipment under terms and conditions of the
            IFB without consideration.    In view of wage rates and
            material increases that is expected in the upcoming
            month. [sic] Id., exh. F.

            In early May, Haas Hardware again extended the bid acceptance

     period, until July 8, 1987, and stated "all pricing and specifi-

     ications remain extended as quoted on the (original) bid."                                 Id.,

     exh.I.

            On June 8, 1987, the District awarded the contract under the

     subject IFB to Haas Hardware. Id. at 4 and exh. J.                               On that same

     date,       DAS wrote to          PTI     informing         it that a      contract had been

     awarded to Haas.                 Regarding the grounds as to why PTI did not

     receive the award, the letter stated, in relevant part:

            Since you were unable to extend the bid acceptance period
            for the subject solicitation, award has been made to the
            second lowest responsive,      responsible bidder,   Haas
            Hardware. Id., exh.K.

                                                      PTI'S PROTEST

                On June 22, 1987, PTI filed its protest of DAS' actions with

         this Board.              In     its protest letter,                PTI argues that DAS acted

         improperly, arbitrarily and without any authority in rejecting

         its bid,        inasmuch as PTI was the low, responsive and responsible

         bidder.            See        Protest        Letter       at      3.              In    support    of      this

         contention,            PTI      argues       that     its       letter            of    March     13,     1987,

         agreeing to an extension of its bid, but at a slightly increased

         price, was a valid bid extension.

                In the alternative,                   PTI    argues,       that even              if DAS did have

         the authority to reject PTI's bid extension, it is estopped from

         doing so.          PTI contends that DAS had a duty to inform PTI if the

         terms of its extension were not acceptable, arguing,

                [b] ecause the DAS had once responded to                                     PTI's extension
                with a request for clarification, the DAS                                    became bound by
                such prior practice to inform PTI if                                        the agency had
                additional or continuing reservations                                       regarding PTI's
                time extension or if the agency planned                                     to rej ect PTI IS
                bid. Protest Letter at 4.

                  By its silence after receipt of PTI                              I   S    letter of March 27,

         DAS     represented            t.o   PT1 that        its bid extension was acceptable.

          Id.    at    4.         PTI     contends          that    it     reasonably              relied    on     DAS '

          silence and that reliance now will work to PTI's detriment if DAS

          is allowed to claim that PTI did not remain the low bidder.                                                Id.

         at     5.       Thus,          PTI    argues,        under        the     doctrine          of     equitable

          estoppel,         DAS    should        be    prohibited           from           asserting      that     PTI IS

          response       to       the     request       for    a     bid        price           extension    was     not

          responsive or that DAS had not agreed to the time extension at

                                                  DISTRICT'S REPLY

                  In     its      Agency      Report,         the       District      argues       that    it     was

           precluded            from   accepting        PTI' s         bid    extension    at      an    increased

           price as to do so would afford PTI an unfair advantage over other

           bidders.             In order to preserve the integrity of the competitive
           bidding system, the District does not allow material modification

           of bids after bid opening.                    See Agency Report at 5.                   Referring to

           sections of the District's Materiel Management Manual and citing

           decisions of the Comptroller General,                               the District argues that

           allowing         a    bidder to       revise a bid after bid opening would be

           tantamount            to    considering        a       second       bid   after       the     time     for

           submitting bids had concluded, Id. at 7.

                 Regarding PTI' s              argument that DAS                should be estopped               from

           asserting            that    PTI     was    not        responsive         to    the     request        for

           extension of the bid acceptance period, the District argues that

           there is no basis for the invocation of the doctrine of equitable

           estoppel.            The District contends that in its letter of March 19,

           1987, DAS clearly and unequivocally informed PTI that a                                       ne~   quote

           was     not      being      sought     but     that          the    District      was       seeking    an

           extension of the original                    bid at the original price.                         PTI,    in

           apparent del iberate disregard of DAS'                              notice that a             bid at an

           increased price would not be acceptable, once again submitted an

           increased bid price.                   As    DAS had already               informed PTI of the

           unacceptability of such a bid,                           the District contends,                 DAS was

           under       no       further       obligation          to     inform      PTI   of      its    on-going

           objections.              Id. at 10.         The District asserts that it has never

                                                        DECISION

                 This   protest        arose     before       the    promulgation             of   regulations

           implementing the District of Columbia Procurement Practices Act

           (PPA) ,2 at. a time when the Materiel Management Manual governed

           the District's procurement process.                           section 2620.8 of the Manual

           speaks of maintaining the                   integrity of the competitive bidding

           process and states:

                 ... It is equally clear that to allow one bidder, after
                 bid opening, to take some action materially affecting his
                 bid so that it may be accepted would be prejudicial to
                 other competitors not afforded a similar opportunity.
                 Therefore, to get the best initial price the one-shot bid
                 procedure is used and material modification of bids after
                 opening is forbidden.    Materiel Management Manual, sec.

                                       Bid Extensions

                 PTI contends that its modification of the initial bid price

           is not prejudicial to other bidders and does not jeopardize the

           integrity     of     the    District's         competitive bidding                 system as      PTI

           was    already       the    apparent        low     bidder       at   bid      opening      and   the

           increase it sought still would have left its bid lower than all

           others.

                2D.C. Code, sec. 1-1181                        et        seq.    (1987)   I    which     became
           effective on February 21, 1986.

                3 The Materiel Management Manual has been superceded by
           regulations published in 27 DCMR, sec. 600 et. seq. (July 1988).
           Although the policy of one-shot bidding expressed in Sec. 2620.8
           has not been specifically incorporated into Title 27, the
           purposes of the PPA reaffirm the need to maintain the integrity
           of the competitive bidding process. See PPA, sec. 1-1181.1(2).

                The Board is unpersuaded by PTI's contentions.                                  The Materiel

         Management Manual does not speak specifically to the mechanics of

         bid acceptance extensions                      or the       scope of modifications which

         may     be     placed        upon     a     bid      without         affecting        its    validity.

         However, the section of the Manual which refers to the integrity

         of the competitive "one-shot" bidding system, when given a plain

         and reasonable reading, gives notice to bidders that modification

         of an original bid price after bid opening will not be allowed.

                The      Board        finds     that         PTI's       attempted      modification           was

         prejudicial to other bidders and threatens the integrity of the

         competitive bidding system.                          If     such a      practice       as    PTI    urges

         were allowed,               there would be nothing to prevent a bidder from

         initially submitting a very low bid in order to be declared the

         apparent low bidder and then, later, after other bid prices have

         been disclosed,              increasing its bid price while still keeping it

         lower than that of the next low bidder.                                If such alterations were

         allowed,         the entire          purpose of           the    competi ti ve     bidding         system

         would be defeated.

                It     is     fundamental          to    the       integrity       of     the       system    that

         bidders        are      each    given       one      shot       at   bidding     on    a    particular

         contract and that each submits its bid without knowledge of the

         content of the other bids .

                A bidder's extension must be unqualified and unconditional.

         No material modifications, such as increases in bid price, may be

         allowed.            The      submission        of    an     extended      bid,    with       a   revised

         price, amounts to a second bid.                           The original bid is withdrawn or

       cancelled.             Addi tionally,              we note that the                  failure to val idly

       extend      a   bid,        when an            extension          is    requested,          results      in the

       expiration of the                   first bid,              which       is precisely what occurred

       here.

              While      the       Board         is     not       bound       by    decisions       of    the    Comp-

       troller General,               this large body of federal government contract

       law frequently is helpful and persuasive when we are confronted

       with      similar           factual            situations.                  On     many     occasions,         the

       Comptroller General has ruled that to allow modification of bid

       prices      after        opening          is      incompatible               with    the    precepts          of   a

       competitive bidding system.                            See N.W. Packing Co., 50 Compo Gen.

                                                  Equitable Estoppel

              PTI's attempt to invoke the principle of equitable estoppel

       is     ill-founded.                    First           of        all,        DAS     did    not    make        the

       misrepresent.dtions                 PTI        a lIeges.          When       PTI    first    submi t   t(~d    its

       extension         at     an        increased           price,          DAS       informed    PTI    that       the

       extension was not acceptable as a new quote was not being sought.

       Secondly,        we note that there                         is    no legal          requirement that the

       District        notify         a      bidder        that          a     revised      bid     constitutes           a

       withdrawal of an original bid.                               Bidders for government contracts

       are held to a knowledge of basic principles of procurement law.

       They proceed at their own risk when they take actions                                             unprotecte~

       by statute, regulations or standard contracting practice.

     Finally, even assuming arguendo that the DAS did represent,

through     its    silence,          to     PTI       that       its    bid    extension had        been

accepted, the principles of equitable estoppel could not properly

be   invoked.           While       the     purpose          of    equitable        estoppel       is    to

prevent a party from benefitting from its misrepresentations to

another, it is clear that a purpose which can not be accomplished

directly     due    to        lack     of     authority            can        not   be    accomplished

indirectly by an estoppel.                   McCormick v. Market Bank 165 U.S. 538

 (1897) .    Since, as a matter of law, DAS is without authority to

. allow a bidder to materially modify its bid after Â· bid opening,

such a result can not be achieved through estoppel.

                                             CONCWSION

     We will not leave this subject, however, without noting that

delays      in    awarding          contracts              past        the    published      deadline,

necessitating           bid    extensions,                 can    be    unfair      to    bidders       who

strive to establish their lowest competitive bid.                                         Furthermore,

bid extensions can result in increased costs to the taxpayer, as

occurred     here       when    the       contract           ultimately         was      awarded    to    a

contractor whose original bid was higher than PTI's.

     Requests for extensions of bids are sometimes necessary and

 unavoidable       (the District has provided no explanation for this

 request) but should be discouraged.                              The District should conduct

 procurement       so    that       bidders           will       have    confidence        that     their

 lowest competitive bid will                          be    the    basis      for determining the

 award of a contract.

while extending the bid acceptance period did not constitute a

valid bid extension.          Therefore,        DAS'    refusal    to accept PTI' s

extension   was   proper     and     its    award      to   Haas   Hardware   \OTas   in

accordance with the dictates of the Materiel Management Manual

which was in effect at the time.

    Accordingly, the protest is hereby denied.
