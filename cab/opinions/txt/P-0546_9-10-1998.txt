                                                OPINION

             Bryan Chaisone, Project Manager for HR General Maintenance Corporation ("HR" or
     "Protester"), protests the Department of Public Works ("DPW") award ofa contact to any of the
     three bidders listed below who submitted bids in response to the solicitation, IFB No. 98-0109-
     AA-2-0-CC. The Protester contends that, at bid opening on May 6, 1998, three bids should have
     been excluded from consideration for contract award for various irregularities in the bid
     documents.

            On June 12, 1998, the protester filed this protest with the Board.

            The protest is dismissed as untimely.

                                            BACKGROUND

             On April6, 1998, DPW issued IFB No. 98-0109-AA-2-0-CC for the replacement of the
     roof of the D .C. Correctional Facility, South Wing, Building #299, located at 300 19Â°' Street,
     S.E .. Bid opening occurred on May 6, 1998, and seven bids were received. At the time of bid
     opening the bids were ranked as follows :

            1. SJC                 $157,000
            2. A&T                 $188,451
            3. Selective           $254,500
            4. NAPA                $257,594
            5. HR                  $258,740
            6. Gibson              $266, 170
            7. Kobane              $497,614
    "   ,                                                                                                       [7581J

                                                             2


I                  After bid opening, HR, which was awarded the 12% bid preference point reduction,
            became the third lowest bidder at a weighted bid of$227,691.20. SJC also received a 7% bid

I           preference point reduction with a weighted bid of$146,010. On May 8, 1998, DPW found all
            seven bids to be responsive.                     .


I                   On June 12, 1998, the Protester filed this protest with the Board asserting that three of the
            bids should have been excluded from consideration for contract award for the (ollowing reasons:

I                  "I. SLC Company, Inc.'s price is well below market price and as such, we feel that the
                   work cannot be performed properly to specifications and scope for the amount quoted.
I                  This bid price is unrealistic in that the raw cost to provide this work and raw labor cost
                   exceeds there(sic) price.

I                  2. A&T Associates, Inc. did not have their bid bond signed by their secretary.
                   3. NAPA Development Corporation's bid package did not include payments to
                   subcontractors and suppliers."

I                  On July 6, 1998, the Government filed a Motion to Dismiss arguing that the protest should


I
            be dismissed because:
                   I . HR filed its protest late with the Board;
                   2. the issue raised with regard to SJC' s bid is not ripe for review;

I                  3. the issue raised with regard to A&T's bid is without merit; and
                   4. the issue raised with regard to NAP A's bid is moot.


I                                                        DECISION


I                   Board rule 302.2, 45 DCR 1415 (March 13, 1998) provides:

                    (a) A protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent
                    prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed
                    with the Board prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals.
                    In procurements where proposals are requested, alleged improprieties which do
                    not exist in the initial solicitation, but which are subsequently incorporated into this
                    solicitation, must be protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of
                    proposals following the incorporation.

                    (b) Protests other than those covered in paragraph (a) shall be filed with the Board
                    not later than ten (10) business days after the basis of the protest is known or
                    should have been known, whichever is earlier.
"   ,                                                                                                       l7583J

                                                         3

                The Board calculates that the 10 business day period would have run from May 7, the day
        after bid opening, until May 20, 1998. However, the Protester waited until June 12, 1998, long
        after the time limit for filing had elapsed. Therefore, the Board is without jurisdiction to hear and
        decide the merits of this protest. Accordingly, this protest is dismissed with prejudice.


        SO ORDERED.
