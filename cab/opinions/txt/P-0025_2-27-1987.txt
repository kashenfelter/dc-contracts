                 GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
                         CONTRACT APPEALS BOARD


PROTEST OF:

      SOUTHERN INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION

      Under IFB No . 6404-AA-89-0-6 - HT

                                SUMMARY OF DECISION

     1.   A protest filed with the Board more than ten working
days after the protester knew or should have known of the facts
and circumstances upon which the protest is based is untimely
and, therefore, will not be considered.

     2. The Minority Business Opportunity Commission has con-
clusive authority under D. C. law to determine matters of minority
business enterprise certification for District government pro-
curement   purposes.  The    Board , therefore,  does    not have
jurisdiction to consider MBOC certification protests.

                                     DECISION

      Southern      International         Corporation      (SIC)    protests      the

Department of Administrative Services'                 decision not to award it

the contract under IFB No. 6404-AA-89-0-6-HT for milk , cream and

related   items.          SIC   appears     to   argue    that     the   Department

disqualified     its   bid because the Minority            Business Opportunity

Commission (MBOC) improperly determined that it was not certified

as a minority business enterprise to receive a contract award for

the procurement.
      According to SIC's protest letter dated July 24,                   1986, SIC

bases its claim on the MBOC ' s letter dated June 26, 1986.                    SIC's

protest letter was addressed to the Department.                    The Department

forwarded the protest letter to the Board by letter dated August

20,   1986,   and   the    Board    received     the    Department's     letter    on

August 27 , 1986.
       D.C. Law 6-85,         ยง908(b)          (effective February 21,              1986), D.C.

Code 1981, ยง1-1189.8(b)                 (1986 Supp.) states:

             For a protest pursuant to subsection (a) of this
        section, the aggrieved person shall file a protest
        with the Board within 10 working days after the
        aggrieved person knew or should have known of the
        facts and circumstances upon which the protest is
        based.  (Emphasis added.)

The    filing    requirements            of    ยง1-1189.8(b)         are     reflected      in    the

Board's      rules    governing          protest       procedures.         See    CAB    Proposed

Rule    300.4.    In this protest,                  SIC did not transmit            its protest

prior to July 24,        1986 (the date of its protest letter).                                SIC's

protest      letter    indicates          that       it    knew    of     the    basis    for    its

protest as a result of the statements made in the MBOC's letter

of    June   26,1986.             In    this    connection,         it    is    noted    that    the

Board's      records    do        not    reflect       when   SIC       received    the    MBOC's

letter.       In any event,             the Board thinks           it reasonable to allow

seven (7)       calendar days for the receipt of the letter under the

circumstances.         The        Board       did    not   receive SIC's         protest until

August 27, 1986.

       Accordingly,          it     appearing          that       SIC's    protest       was     not

received by the Board until more than ten (10) days after it knew

or should have known of the facts                          and circumstances upon which

the protest is based, the protest is dismissed as untimely.

       Even if the Board were to have concluded that SIC had timely

filed its protest, it appears from the face of the protest letter

that SIC has not raised a protest cognizable by this Board.                                       To

the extent that SIC is challenging the MBOC's determination that

it is not a certified minority business enterprise (MBE)                                  for the




                                                - 2 -
procurement in question, the MBOC has conclusive authority under

D.C. Law 1-95,   as amended,   D.C.   Code 1981,   ยง1-1141,    et   ~   to

determine matters   of MBE certification     for   District government

procurement   purposes.    The   Board,   therefore,    does    not   have

jurisdiction to consider MBOC certification protests.

      For the foregoing reasons, the protest is dismissed.
