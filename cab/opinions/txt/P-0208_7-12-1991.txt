                 For the Protestor: George A. Carter, President. For the Government: Nancy
           Hapeman, Assistant Corporation Counsel, and Anne Cauman, Assistant Corporation
           Counsel.

           Zoe Bush and David H. Marlin concurring.

                                                         OPINION

                  In this protest Carter Fuel Oil Co. (Carter) alleges that as the lowest responsive
           and responsible bidder, it should have been awarded the contract which resulted from
           Request for Proposal No. 9121-AA-NS-0-9-KC (RFP); and that the action of the District
           in awarding the contract to Tri-Continental Industries, Inc. (Tri-Con), whose offered
           price was the highest, was improper. The District contends that there does not exist any
           basis for Carter's protest because Carter has imposed an invalid standard for award of
           a procurement conducted by means of competitive sealed proposals--that of lowest bid
           price. We agree with the District and for the reasons hereinafter discussed, we deny the
           protest.

                  On January 20, 1989, the Department of Administrative                   Services (DAS) issued an
           RFP in the sheltered market for the supply and delivery of                     gasoline and heating oil
           products. The RFP set February 22, 1989 as the closing                          date for submission of
           proposals. Subsequently, four addenda and an amendment to                      the RFP finally extended
           the closing date to June 7, 1989.

                  DAS received six responses to the RFP;Y however, Green Fuel Oil Company
           (Green), General Oil Corporation (General Oil),?' Tri-Con, and Carter were the only
           companies evaluated as technically acceptable and found to be within the competitive
           range. The four proposals were reviewed by a panel of five evaluators.


             YProposals were received from Tri-Continental Industries, Inc., Green Fuel Oil Company, General Oil
           Corporation, and Carter Fuel Oil Company, Inc. A finh olTeror, District Line Fuel Company, Inc.,
           submitted a sub-contractor olTer only; and the sixth olTeror, Collins Electronics, submitted a no-bid.

            YOn May 8, 1989 General Oil Corporation filed a protest with the Board alleging that the RFP
           contained two unduly restricted requirements. fu:!:, General Oil Corporation, P-155 (D.C. CAB April 20,

                   Section E of the RFP contains the following seven evaluation criteria with
            assigned numerical weights which were to be used in rating the proposals:

                    (1)   Cost                                                           0-   25 point.
                    (2)   Subcontract Plan                                               0-   19 points
                    (3)   Location of Terminal and Rack Facilities                       0-    6 points
                    (4)   Demonstrated Satisfactory Performance                          0-   12 points
                    (5)   Location of Bank or Saving & Loan Association                  0-    5 points
                    (6)   General Operating Capability                                   0-   18 points
                    (7)   Source of Supply                                               0-   26 points

           The maximum points obtainable from each evaluator was 100.                              (Exh. 1 to Agency
           Report.)

                  After receipt of the first round of best and final offers, the District evaluated the
           offers and assigned various point scores. Tri-Con received the highest evaluation,
           followed by Green, General Oil, and Carter. Tri-Con's price was also the highest, while
           Carter's was the lowest. (Exh. 8.) The District then conducted discussions with each of
           the four ofTerors and upon completion of the discussions set June 23, 1989, as the date
           for submission of the second round of best and final offers. Each of the four ofTerors
           submitted a second best and final offer, which resulted in the following points scores:

                                            Technical         Cost             Total

                   General Oil                172             111.70           283.70            $13,437,141.57

           Based upon the above point scores, the District awarded the contract to Tri-Con as the
           highest-rated offeror. Tri-Con's price remained the highest.

                  It is readily apparent from Carter's protest letter, and its reliance on a "low bid"
           price theory, that it has confused the competitive sealed "bidding" process with that of
           the competitive sealed "proposal" process.~ Award in a procurement conducted by means
           of competitive sealed proposals is made on the basis of evaluation factors stated in the
           RFP and not on the basis of the "low bidder". Since the procurement involved in this
           case was by means of competitive sealed proposals, which included evaluation criteria, it




            Jln.c. Code § 1-1181.1 !! ~ (1987), requires that the District conduct procurement by means of either
          competitive sealed bidding or competitive sealed proposals, unless there is only one source available.

           is not detenninative of award that the price submitted by Carter was lower than the
           price submitted by Tri-Con.~

                  In a procurement by means of competitive sealed bidding, the District solicits
           bids through the issuance of an Invitation for Bids (IFB), and the award is made to the
           responsive and responsible bidder with the lowest price. See, D.C. Code § 1-1183.3(b)
           and (e). Price is the determinative factor for award in any such procurement pursuant
           to an IFB. Competetive sealed proposals is defined in § 1-1181.7(11) of the D.C. Code
           as: "[a] process which includes the submission of sealed written technical and price
           proposals from 2 or more sources and a written evaluation of each proposal in
           accordance with evaluation criteria which consider price, quality of the items,
           performance and other relevant factor.~

                   Under the evaluation factors stated in the instant RFP, price was an important
           factor, but it was not the determining factor for award. Out of a total 100 maximum
           possible points to be assigned to proposals upon evaluation, the District allowed a
           maximum of 25 points for price. As a result, price accounted only for 25% of the
           possible 100 points an offeror could achieve; while the remaining factors accounted for
           75% of the possible 100 points. Section 1-1183.4(c) requires that each request for

            1ID.C. Code   §   1-1183.2(b) provides that:

              In selecting 1 of the methods authorized by this section for the awarding of contracts, it is the
              policy of the District government that competitive sealed bidding shall be the preferred method for
              awarding contracts.

                Section 1-1183.3. Competitive sealed bidding, provides:

                     (8)     Contracts exceeding the amount provided by § 1-1183.6 shall be awarded by
                competitive sealed bidding unless the Director determines in writing that:

                            (1)    Specifications cannot be prepared that permit an award on the basis of either
               the lowest bid price or lowest evaluated bid price;

                               (2)    There is only 1 available source;

                           (3)        There is an unanticipated emergency which leaves insufficient time to use
               this method; or

                            (4)   There is some other reason in the best interest of the District government
               which is so compelling as to use 1 of the other authorized methods.



          The record reveals that the District complied with the requirements of § 1-1183.3(a) in utilizing
          competitive sealed proposals instead of competitive sealed bidding. ~ Exhs. 5, 6, 7, 8 attached to
          District's Reply to Carter's Response to Agency Report.

            gu the RFP contains no evaluation factors § 1614.1 of 27 DCMR allows the District to select a
          contractor through the use of an RFP that sets forth price competition as a criterion for award so long as
          the offeror is responsible and its offer meets the minimum needs of the District.

           proposals indicate the relative importance of each evaluation factor. This was done in
           this case through the assignment of a numerical weight to each factor.

                   The District conducted its evaluation of each of the four otTerors' proposals in
           accordance with the evaluation factors stated in the RFP. (Exh. 8 to Agency Report.)
           After completion of discussions with the oiTerors, and receipt of two rounds of best and
           final otTers, the District concluded that Tri-Con was the highest-rated otTeror. Based on
           Tri-Con's higher score (which indicated that its otTer represented the greatest value to
           the District in terms of technical merit) its prices, and an affirmative finding of
           responsibility, the District awarded the contract to Tri-Con on October 5, 1989. See,
           Exhs. 1, 10 to Agency Report; D.C. Code § 1-1183.4 (b). This action was in accord with
           the requirements of the solicitation and the D.C. Code.

                    Section B.16 of the RFP pertaining to contract award provides as follows:

                    A.      The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicita-
                            tion to the responsible otTeror whose otTer conforming to the
                            solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, cost
                            or price and other factors, specified elsewhere in this solicitation,
                            considered.

                    Section 1-1183.4(1) of the D.C. Code mandates that:

                   [a]ward of the contract shall be made to the responsible otTeror whose
                   proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the District
                   government, considering price and the evaluation factors set forth in the
                   request for proposals. (Emphasis supplied.)

                 In its response to the agency report Carter raises for the first time the propriety
          of the District using the competitive sealed bidding method of procurement The
          District contends that Carter's belated challenge is untimely and improper because it
          raises issues not raised in its initial protest letter of October 19, 1989. The District
          requests that we strike the response. Since we have determined from the record that the
          District did in fact comply with the requirements of § 1-1183.3 (a) in using the
          competitive sealed proposal process, we need not address the District's request

                 Carter also raises in its response the need for a conference and discovery. Section
          310 of our rules provides that a conference may be held at the discretion of the Board
          upon its own motion or upon the request of the protestor. Our rules also provide for
          discovery if no agency report is tiled in order to provide a sufficient factual basis for the
          fair and just resolution of the protest.

                 In its attempt to justify the need for a conference, Carter raises the specter that
          there may have been procurement deficiencies, ergo, a conference is needed to determine
          what occurred. The alleged procurement deficiencies are in the form of statements by
          Carter of questions it believes existed regarding the procurement Questions about areas
          of concern in the procurement do not rise to the level of clear and concise statements of

            protest grounds. A conference is not the place to look into issues that are not stated
            grounds of the protest. The Board acts as a quasi-judicial body, not as an investigating
            arm of the government. Our role is the development of the record in the context of
            affirmative protest grounds clearly spelled out in the protest.

                   We note also that the District filed a voluminous agency report with numerous
            exhibits attached thereto. Carter failed to demonstrate in its response that the report
            does not provide a sufficient factual basis upon which to decide the stated grounds of its
            protest, nor did Carter set forth any facts which contradict the District's exhibits. The
            purpose of discovery is to aid the Board in a just resolution of the protest, not to enable
            a protestor to conduct a fishing expedition so as to develop the grounds of its protest.
            Therefore, we find a conference and discovery would be inappropriate in this case.

                   Accordingly, the record having revealed that (1) Carter's offer received a fair
            evaluation according to the requirements set forth in the solicitation, (2) the District's
            use of the competitive sealed proposals process was appropriate, and (3) the award to
            Tri-Con was proper, the protest is hereby DENIED.
