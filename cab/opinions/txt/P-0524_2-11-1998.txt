                                        OPINION AND ORDER

        Barcode Technologies, Inc. ("Barcode or Protester") filed the subject protest alleging that
award of a contract to Horton & Barber ("Horton"), the apparent low bidder, would violate the
solicitation terms requiring that bidders be certified as small business enterprises ("SBE") in the
procurement category of "Goods and Equipment" in order to be eligible to submit bids. Barcode also
challenges the eligibility ofNu-Tech Cleaning Management, Inc. ("Nu-Tech"), the apparent second
low bidder, on the same ground. The District seeks to dismiss the protest on the ground that Barcode
has no standing. Horton joins the District in seeking the dismissal of Barcode on the basis of lack of
standing and also raises a challenge to the timeliness of this protest. We find that the protest is timely,
that the Protester does have standing, and that the protest should be sustained on its merits.

                                                   FACTS

        On May 14, 1997, the Department of Administrative Services ("DAS") issued, in the small
business set-aside market, Solicitation No. 7324-AA-03-S-BS for management of vending machines.
(Agency Report ("AR"), Ex. 1). The solicitation limited bidder eligibility to SBEs certified in the
procurement category of "Goods and Equipment." (Jd., ยง I.8.I)!' By Addendum No.1, the SBE


liThe relevant provisions at Section I, "Contract Clauses" of the solicitation provide:

        1.8      Clauses For Procurement Restricted to the SBE Set Aside Market

        1.8.1   Designation of Solicitation for the Small Business Set-Aside Market Only

                                                                                            ( continued ... )

                                                                                                      I~I
                                                                                                   [7484]


                                                      -2-       Barcode Technologies, Inc., CAB No. P-524

certification and eligibility requirements were deleted. (AR. Ex. 1). Addendum No. 3 re-inserted the
SBE certification restricting eligibility to bidders certified in the "Goods and Equipment" procurement
category. (Jd). We are told that bid opening was held on July 2, 1997, but it is unrebutted by the
District that bid opening was not done publicly as required by 27 DCMR ยง 1527. (AR, page 2). DAS
received bids from five bidders?' Horton submitted the apparent low bid at a percentage fee of 16%
of estimated gross commission. (AR, Ex. 2 and 7). Nu-Tech submitted the second low bid and
Barcode was the third low bidder. (AR, Ex. 2). Among the three lowest bidders (Horton, Nu-Tech
and Barcode), only Barcode possessed the MBOC certification in the prescribed SBE category of
Goods and Equipment.

        On September 30, 1997, the Chief Procurement Officer issued a Determination and Finding
of contractor responsibility in favor of Horton. (AR, Ex. 5). On the same date as the
Determination and Finding was issued, a memorandum of approval of award was issued by the Chief
Financial Officer. (AR, Ex. 6).

      By letter dated November 13, 1997, the Office of Contracting and Procurement notified
Barcode of award to Horton. (AR, Ex. 7). Barcode received this letter on November 17, 1997.
(Barcode Comments dated January 20, 1998).

        On November 13, 1997, Barcode filed the subject protest alleging that award of a contract to
Horton would be in violation of the solicitation tenns. On December 16, 1997, the District filed a
motion to dismiss the protest, or in the alternative, Agency Report. As grounds for the motion to
dismiss, the District argues that Barcode is not an aggrieved party because it would not be in line for
award of the contract even if its protest were upheld and that Barcode's bid was nonresponsive
because it added an "aggregate" bid to the schedule that it submitted.

                                                  -3-      Barcode Technologies, Inc., CAB No. P-524

        On December 22, 1997, Barcode filed a response to the District's motion/Agency Report.
Barcode argues that the District's challenge to its standing as an aggrieved party is a moot issue
because both Horton and Nu-Tech lack certification in the prescribed SBE category of Goods and
Equipment and it (Barcode) meets the eligibility category for submission of bids and is the low
responsive bidder. In response to the District's allegation that Barcode's bid was nonresponsive,
Barcode argues that its bid was responsive because it provided a price for each category, i.e., sodas
and other products, and that the addition of the word "aggregate" on the Barcode bid did not have
a negative or material impact on the calculations or the rankings of the bidders.

       On January 15, 1998, in addition to joining the District in its challenge to Barcode's standing,
Horton filed a motion to dismiss the protest as untimely on the ground that Barcode knew or should
have known of the contract award to Horton by October 21, 1997. Barcode filed a response to
Horton's motion on January 20, 1998. The District did not file a response to Horton's motion.

                                           DISCUSSION

         We exercise jurisdiction over the protest pursuant to D.C. Code ยง 1-1189.3(a)(1) (Supp.
1997).

Timeliness

        Horton argues that Barcode knew or should have known of the award to Horton by October
21, 1997. Horton argues that this date would have been one week after the "probable" date of a
conversation between Horton's representative, Mr. Barber, and the contracting official, Mr. Charles
Jackson, wherein Mr. Barber requested Barcode's final accounting and Mr. Jackson promised to
contact Barcode for that information. Horton alleges that Barcode should have filed its protest by
November 4, 1997. In support of this contention, Horton offers the declaration of Mr. Barber which
states that (1) Mr. Barber had contacted vendors advising them that Horton was the new vending
management agent for the District; (2) that on October 30, 1997, Mr. Jackson informed Mr. Barber
that he had already talked with Mr. Williams of Barcode about a final vending report; (3) that Mr.
Barber contacted Mr. Williams regarding the final vending report on November 5, 1997; and (4) that
Horton has been performing the contract since the date of its award.

       It is a well established principle that a protest fIled more than 10 days after the Protester
knew, or should have known, the basis of the protest is untimely. This Board lacks jurisdiction
over protests of awards that are not filed within the 10-working-day requirement. See Budget Lock
and Key, CAB No. P-497, July 30, 1997,44 D.C. Reg. 6856; Good Food Service, Inc. CAB No.
P-457, Aug. 27, 1996, 44 D.C. Reg. 6492; Eastern Shield, CAB No. P-369, Mar. 2, 1993,40
D.C. Reg. 5001; Continental Flooring Co., CAB No. P-402, Apr. 11, 1994, 42 D.C. Reg. 4542.

        It is undisputed that on September 30, 1997, the Chief Procurement Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer approved award of the contract to Horton. (AR, Ex. 5,6). It is also not disputed
that Mr. Barber advised Barcode of contract award to Horton on November 5, 1997. By letter dated
N<?vember 13, 1997, the District advised the unsuccessful bidders, including Barcode, of contract




                                                                                                     "a
                                                                                              [7486]


                                                   -4-      Barcode Technologies, Inc., CAB No. P-524

award to Horton. The November 13 letter did not inform Barcode of its third placed ranking.
(protest; AR, Ex. 7). Barcode alleges that it did not receive the November 13 letter until November
17, 1997, and that it filed its protest based upon Mr. Barber's November 5, 1997 call. (Barcode's
Reply filed January 20, 1998). The key issue is when did Barcode know or when should Barcode
have known the SBE categories in which Horton was certified for purposes of this bid.

         The MBOC letter to Barcode dated November 12, 1997, which states that Horton was not
certified in the SBE category of "Goods and Equipment" and that Horton lacked eligibility to bid
in response to a set aside solicitation in that category provides the only documentation of record
for determining when Barcode was advised of the SBE categories in which Horton was certified.
The District has not offered any evidence of an earlier notification to Barcode of the award or
certification status of Horton. Even if Horton had notified Barcode of its SBE certification defect
on November 5, 1998, Barcode's protest would still be timely, having been filed on November 13,
1997. The record does not reflect the exact date when Barcode became aware of the certification
status of Nu-Tech, but it does reflect that Barcode was notified of its third place ranking upon the
filing of the Agency Report on December 16, 1997. 31 We conclude that Barcode's specific
challenge of Nu-Tech's eligibility was timely raised in its comments to the Agency Report filed on
December 22, 1997.

Standing

        To have standing to protest, a party must be aggrieved. In other words, the protester must
have a direct economic interest in the procurement. See Wayne Mid-Atlantic, CAB No. P-227,
August 12, 1993,41 D.C. Reg. 3594, 3595. Accordingly, this Board has held that a protester lacks
standing where it would not be in line for award, even ifits protest were upheld. Roy's Towing Corp.,
CAB No. P-468, June 13, 1997,44 D.C. Reg. 6832, 6833; CrawfordlEdgewoodManagers, Inc., CAB
No. P-424, Mar. 22, 1995,42 D.C. Reg. 4957; Commando K-9 Detectives, Inc., CAB Nos. P-405
& 406, May 6, 1994,42 D.C. Reg. 4597; Unfoldment, Inc., CAB No. P-358, Sept. 17, 1993,41 D.C.
Reg. 3656.

       Based on the bid tabulation, Barcode was third in line among the bidders. Nevertheless, since
Barcode challenges the eligibility of both the first and second low bidders, Barcode, if successful,
would be next in line for award. Therefore, Barcode has standing to protest.




3/The Agency Report filed on December 16, 1997, provided Barcode notice of its third place ranking. (AR,
p.4). Barcode's timely response to the Agency Report filed on December 22, 1998, references document
attadunents from the Department of Human Rights and Local Business Development (formerly MBOC)
which state that "neither Horton and Barber nor Nu-Tech is certified in Goods and Equipment." However,
only the MBOC attachment concerning Horton was filed at that time. During a telephone conference held
on January 9, 1998, the Board requested a copy ofMBOC documentation of the certification status ofNu-
Tech at the time of bid opening. The District provided this information on January 13, 1998.

Responsiyeness

        The District argues that Barcode's bid is nonresponsive since it added the word "aggregate"
with a corresponding sum of its unit fee items to the schedule submitted with its bid. In pertinent part,
Barcode's bid appeared as follows :

        BASE YEAR
        B.l   DESCRIPTION               UNIT             EST GROSS              PERCENTAGE FEE
        B.l.l   Fee for                                  COMMISSION
                canned sodas            YEAR             $100,000

        B.l.2   Fee for all             YEAR             $100,000
                other products
                and services                             Aggregate               19.96

CAR, Ex. 8).
The District argues that the solicitation did not require bidders to submit "aggregate" bids and that
Barcode submitted an ambiguous bid because Barcode did not clearly demonstrate how the aggregate
bid percentage should be applied to calculate the fee for each item.

        It is well established that a responsive bid must present an unequivocal offer to provide the
exact item called for in the solicitation and that when the District accepts such a bid, it legally binds
the offeror to perfonn in accordance with all the material tenns of the solicitation. Southern Maryland
Restoration, Inc., CAB No. P-241, Aug. 7, 1991,39 D.C. Reg. 4268.

         We do not agree that Barcode's bid is ambiguous. Barcode's bid did not omit any items called
for in the solicitation, but added the tenn "aggregate" to its bid along with a sum of its unit percentage
fees. Barcode did not materially alter its bid in any way simply by those additions. It is also apparent
that contracting officials did not determine Barcode's bid to be ambiguous for the purpose of
evaluating and ranking the bi~ders. CAR, Ex.2). We find that Barcode's bid represents an unequivocal
offer to provide the exact items called for in the solicitation. Barcode's bid is responsive.

EIi&ibility

         Horton, the apparent low bidder was registered as a SBE in the categories of "Business
Services" and "General Services" at the time of bid opening. CAR, Ex. 3). Nu-Tech, the apparent
second low bidder, was registered as a SBE in the category of "Business Services" at the time of bid
opening. (District's supplemental letter, MBOC Certificate of Registration attachment). Neither was
certified in the SBE category of "Goods and Equipment." Barcode was certified as a Small Business
Enterprise in the categories of ' 'Business Services", "General Services", and "Goods and Equipment"
at the time of bid opening. CAR, Ex. 4). Thus, Barcode was the low eligible and responsive bidder.

         A party who is not properly certified under the SBE category required by the solicitation, is
ineligible to bid on the solicitation. J&K Distributors, Inc. of Wash., D. C. and Urban Service Systems
Corp., CAB No. P-432 & 433, June 13, 1995,42 D.C. Reg. 4986. Neither Horton nor Nu-Tech was


                                                                                                     /(,D
                                                                                       [7488]

eligible to bid on the subject solicitation. The award to Horton violates the procurement law and the
terms of the solicitation. Therefore, the District shall cancel the award.

       Accordingly, the protest is SUSTAINED.
