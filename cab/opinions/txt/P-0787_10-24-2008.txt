                                  MOTION TO INTERVENE


       C&D Tree Service, Inc. ("C&D), by its undersigned counsel, and in accordance with
Rule 110.1 of the D.C. Contract Appeals Board ("Board"), hereby respectfully requests that the
Board grant C&D leave to intervene in the above-captioned pre-award protest as an interested
party as defined under Board Rules 100.2(k) and (1). C&D is clearly a prospective awardee as
noted below.
       Excel Tree Expert Co., Inc. ("Excel"), located at 7549 Montevideo Road, Jessup, MD,
20794 (Tel. (410) 799-3266), filed a pre-award protest on October 9, 2008 concerning
Solicitation No. DCKA-2008-B-0050 ("Solicitation") issued by the District Department of
Transportation ("DDoT") for tree pruning services. Under the Solicitation, DDoT was to make
four separate contract awards.
       C&D submitted the overall lowest unit bid price. Attachment A. C&D furnished all the
requisite responsibility information to the District. Attachment B. C&D is also an incumbent
contractor for this type of work and has in place all of the required equipment and personnel to
perform all four awards at a significant savings to the District. Attachment C. On September 22,
2008, DDoT in fact had informed C&D that it would be receiving an award package under the
Solicitation during that week. Attachment D. For these reasons, C&D clearly is a prospective
awardee whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of the resulting contract
or by the failure to award the resulting contract due to Excel's protest, and therefore, C&D is
entitled to intervene in this protest under the Board's rules.     See Protest oJ Fort Myer
Construction Corporation, CAB No. P-261(A), 1992 LEXIS 216 at 3 (D.C.C.A.B. Jan. 28,
1992).
         WHEREFORE, for the reasons set forth above, C&D respectfully requests that the Board
grant its motion to intervene in the above-captioned protest.



                                             Respectfully submitted,

      2008 (Please note C&D is current on all of its District taxes and filings).

   2. List of current contracts relative to this service or commodity:
      For the past 5 years C&D performed like and kind services to the District under
      Contract #02-0014-AA-2-0-KA.

   3. Please find an attached list of current employees who are specifically trained to
      provide pruning services under these contract(s) based on their prior contract

   4. With a highly experienced staff oriented to the UFA's operational processes C&D

Additionally, C&D would like to state for the record that it currently maintains in place,
the required staff, equipment, and expertise to perform all (4) four of the potential awards
for these services at a very significant financial savings to the District based on the bid
tabulations of the other contractors submitting bids of between 140%-400% above the
cost of same services if provided by C&D.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Respectfully,



Scott Nelson

Subject: Re: Award of DCKA-2008-6-0050
Hi Ms. Hatcher,

Thank you for your quick response to this issue as I was not sure why the award had been made per our previous discussion.

In counter of Excel's claims, I wish to again state for the record, that C&D as the previous incumbent District contractor on this
type of contract, (as well as C&D being the low, responsive and responsible bidder on this solicitation), has in place all of the
required equipment and personnel to perform all four awards at a significant savings to the District.

Again, thank you for your prompt response as we await the results of the Excel Tree Experts Protest.

Sincerely,

Scott Nelson

President

 Mr. Nelson - No contracts were awarded. Per District law, no contracts will be awarded until this protest is settled by
 CAB or some other means. The only exception to the law, is if the Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) determines in
 writing that there is some compelling reason why the District needs to award the contracts. We do not anticipate the
 CPO making such a determination.
