PROTEST OF:

     PINNACLE CORPORATION

     Under IFB No. 86-0062-AA-2-0-CC


     For the protester: Jack Rephan, Esquire. For the Government:
Frank E. Barber, Assistant Corporation Counsel, D.C.

     opinion by Administrative Judge     Davis   with   Administrative
Judges Booker and Sharpe 1 concurring.


                        SUMMARY OF OPINION

     STANDARD OF REVIEW--NONRESPONSIBILITY DETERMINATION.     The
D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985 ("PPA"), D.C. Code, secs.
1-1189.3(1) and 1-1189.8 (c) (1987 Replacement) confers on this
Board jurisdiction to hear and decide all protests (including
those challenging a nonresponsibility determination) on a de novo
basis.  Thus, given this standard of review and the PPA's mandate
in sec. 1-1189.8(c) that "the Board shall promptly decide whether
the solicitation or award was in accordance with the applicable
law, regulations, and terms and conditions of the solicitation,"
all that is required for the protester to prevail on the issue of
responsibility is a showing (by a preponderance of the evidence)
that the District materially violated an applicable law, regula-
tion or term or condition of the IFB in making the nonrespon-
sibility determination in question.

     RESPONSIBILITY--SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY CRITERION.   Where the
District failed to clearly state in the IFB the legitimate policy
decision it made that the roofing contractor "itself" must have
five years of relevant roofing experience, the District could not
properly exclude from its consideration the relevant roofing
experience of the protester's officers and employees when
evaluating whether the protester met the five years roofing
experience requirement.   Thus, the mere fact that the protester
had not been previously in existence for five years as a corporate
entity should not have been dispositive of the question of whether
it met the five years roofing experience requirement.




     1Judge Sharpe's participation in this case is pursuant to the
authority contained in the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985,
D.C. Code, sec. 1-1189.2(c) (2) (1987 Replacement).

     RELIEF--BID PREPARATION COSTS. Where there is nothing in the
record which supports the District's reading of the IFB's special
responsibility criterion, the District's misinterpretation of the
criterion and application of the misinterpretation to the
protester is unreasonable and therefore arbitrary and capricious
within the meaning of sec. l-1189.8(e) (2).     Thus, in the cir-
cumstance where the record reflects that the contract at issue has
in all likelihood been completed by another contractor, the
protester's request for reasonable bid preparation costs is
granted.
                                          OPINION

      This      protest 2     by    the        Pinnacle      Corporation      ("pinnacle")
presents a       classic case of a study in contradictions.                           At the
outset, we have no reservation whatsoever in stating that we find
little    to     admire     in     the    manner       in    which   the    responsibility
evaluation involved in this protest was conducted.

      Pinnacle protests the award of a contract under Invitation
for   Bids      No.    86-0062-AA-2-0-CC              ("IFB")   to   anyone    other       than
itself.        In this      connection,         Pinnacle alleges that           it    is    the
lowest, responsive and responsible bidder under the IFB, but that
the District of Columbia ("District")                       incorrectly determined that
the   corporation was nonresponsible                    and therefore       ineligible to
receive the contract award.
      The Department of Public Works ("DPW") on December 18, 1986,
issued    the    IFB    for      roofing work          construction    at     the    Harrison

     2This case originated during a period of time when the
District of Columbia Contract Appeals Board was functioning
pursuant to Commissioner's Organization Order No.9, D.C. Code,
Supplement V (1978), as amended by Mayor's Order No. 82-224, 30
DCR 497 (January 28, 1983) and Mayor's Order 86-65, 33 DCR 3006
(May 16, 1986).    Pursuant to sec. 1-1189.1, a new independent
agency denominated as the Contract Appeals Board was created.
This new Board became operational on August 1, 1988, and succeeded
to jurisdiction of all protest cases pending before the previously
established Board.

Elementary School.         six bids were timely received in response to

the IFB.      Although Pinnacle submitted the apparent low bid,                  it

did not receive the contract.              Instead,      the contract award was
made to H&R General Maintenance corporation                 ("H&R"),     the fourth
low bidder.

        Notification to Pinnacle of its unsuccessful bid was first

communicated by a         letter dated June 29,          1987,    from DPW.    That
letter merely returned Pinnacle's bid package,                   indicated that it

was not the successful low bidder and thanked it for the submis-

sion.     The letter did not contain any reasons as to why Pinnacle
was   not   the   successful   bidder.           Pinnacle states that sometime
between the date of the receipt of the June 29 letter (which was

July 8,     1987, according to Pinnacle) and July 16, 1987 (the date
of the filing of this protest), it was informed that an award had

been made to H&R on May 27,              1987.      Pinnacle further states it

orally received word that the rejection of its bid was based on

the     corporation's     failure   to    meet     the   five    years   experience

requirement set forth in article 10 under the Special Conditions
of the IFB.       That article reads in pertinent part as follows:
        "10. CONTRACTOR'S OUALIFICATION:
         "A. The Contractor shall have had a minimum of
             five (5) years experience in this type and
             size of project."

It is this special condition (hereinafter referred to as "Special
Condition No.      10")   and its interpretation that is at the hub of
this protest.
                                            - 4 -

      Pinnacle       contends        that    the    District's           determination        of
nonresponsibility            was     arbitrary      and     irrational         because      the
experience evaluation of the corporation under Special Condition
No. 10 was restricted to the fact that it had not been previously
incorporated for five years.                 The evaluation, contends Pinnacle,
should have         included       the   experience    of    the        officials     and    key
employees of the corporation.                   In this regard,           Pinnacle points
out that its president and vice president had roofing experience

far in excess of five years and with other projects of the type
and   size    as    the   project here,         and it planned to utilize five
experienced individuals to perform the actual field work.
      The District does not dispute the basis of the nonrespon-
sibility determination as alleged by Pinnacle but contends that
the determination to restrict the five years experience require-
ment solely to Pinnacle as a corporate entity rather than consider

the   experience       of    Pinnacle's        officers     and    employees         was    made

because      that    is     what     Special     Condition        No.     10   specifically
required.      This interpretation, it says, was the result of an in-
house policy determination geared towards improving the quality of
the work obtained and guarding against a contractor going out of
business before the proj ect was completed or the work warranty
having    expired.          Having made this          determination,           the   District

asserts that since it was within the discretion of the DPW to make

it, this Board should not disturb the determination unless there
is a showing that there was no rational and reasonable basis for
the decision or that the contracting officer acted in bad faith.
                                      - 5 -

In support of this position,           the District relies on a                host of

U.S. Comptroller General's opinions.

       A prospective contractor's ability or capacity to satisfac-

torily perform all the requirements of a contract relates to its

responsibility,      and an affirmative demonstration of this ability

or capacity is a precondition for the award of a contract.                            See
D.C.    Procurement    Practices      Act     of   1985,     D.C.     Code    secs.    1-

1181. 7 (40)    and 1-1183.3 (e)    (1987 Replacement).             The Comptroller

General has for a number of years consistently taken the position

that he will not disturb a nonresponsibility determination absent

a showing of possible fraud or bad faith or lack of a reasonable

basis thereof on the part of a contracting officer.                          See,~,

Satellite Services Inc.,       B-219679, Aug.          23,    1985,    85-2 CPD par.
224; Martin Electronics, Inc.,          B-221298, Mar.         13, 1986, 86-1 CPD

par. 252; and Shelf Stable Foods, Inc., B-226112, April 10, 1987,
87-1 CPD par. 400.         The District of Columbia would urge that we

adopt this standard of review.          Our adoption of the standard would

most certainly impose a very heavy burden upon one who chooses to
protest     a   nonresponsibility     determination          and    would    require    a
deference be given to the findings of contracting officers.
       We   emphatically     reject    an      adoption      of     the     Comptroller
General's standard of review because it flies squarely in the face

of our statutory mandate.          Unlike the legislative underpinnings of

the Comptroller General's protest review authority, the PPA, sec.

1-1189.3(1),      confers on this      Board       jurisdiction to          "review and

determine de novo any protest" which has been addressed to us.
                                  -   6 -

This mandate of authority is repeated in sec. 1-1189.8 ("Protest
of solicitations or awards to the Board")              under subsection      (c),
which provides in pertinent as follows:

     "On any direct protest .     . the Board shall promptly
     decide whether the solicitation or award was in accord-
     ance with the applicable law, regulations and terms and
     conditions of the solicitation.   The proceedings shall
     be de novo.   Any prior determination by administrative
     officials shall not be final or conclusive."
In view of these statutory provisions,             all    that we require of
Pinnacle to prevail on the        issue of responsibility           is that it

demonstrate     by   a   preponderance      of   the     evidence   a    material
violation by the District of an applicable law, regulation or term

or condition of the IFB in making the nonresponsibility determina-

tion in question.

     That stated, we turn now to the merits of this protest and
address first the District's position that a business and policy
decision   underlie      the   interpretation      it     placed    on    Special
Condition No.    10. 3    We note here that we do not question the

authority of the District to set special responsibility criterion


     3The District of Columbia has supplied the Board with what we
will   loosely term the "administrative history" of Special
Condition No. 10.  This history is in the form of affidavits from
two employees of the Design,        Engineering and Construction
Administration of the DPW who allegedly were responsible along
with an unnamed outside architectural engineering firm and other
unnamed staff members in developing Special Condition No. 10.
This history concludes that it was the intention of all of those
who worked on the development of Special Condition No. 10 that the
experience requirement had to be satisfied by the track record of
the bidding firm rather than through the individual experience of
its employees.    The justification for this conclusion was the
staff's belief that a firm in business for at least five years
would be more qualified to complete the project in a satisfactory
manner and would more likely be available to meet the warranty
requirements. See Agency Report, Exhibits D and E.
                                              - 7 -

in this procurement.                 That     it had that          right    is    indisputable.

See,   generally Materiel Management Manual                         ("MMM"),      sec.    2620.18.

This therefore is not the issue.                       The relevant issue here concerns

a matter which goes to the very                        heart of the District's procure-

ment system and that is basic fairness in the treatment of those

who seek to do business with it.                          Did the District clearly and

unequivocally         articulate         in   Special          Condition No.       10     its   bona

fide business and policy decision that a roofing firm itself must

have had at          least    five       years    of    roofing experience           similar to

what was       desired       on    the    Harrison       Elementary School           project       in

order to be a responsible bidder?                       We think not.        As indicated by

the    discussion      that        follows,       we    find     the    language     in    Special

Condition No.         10 to be vague and imprecise; we further find an

egregious failure            to communicate to the marketplace DPW' s                           "new"

policy and a contradictory application of the condition.

       The District's primary argument is essentially an attempt to

bootstrap its interpretation of "contractor" as used in Special

Condition      No.    10     to    the    definition       given the word           in sec.        1-

1181. 7 (16)    of the PPA ("any business which enters into a contract

agreement with the            District").              Whatever        linguistic    force      this

argument may initially have had,                        it rapidly deteriorated in the

face of the record.               We carefully scrutinized the Agency Report in

search of a reference for some positive indication either in the

procurement       regulations            or      the     IFB    which     would     compel        the

definitional leap the District urges and found our search wanting.

The absence of any such reference seems to imply that whenever the
                                              - 8 -

word "contractor" is used in a procurement document,                                  it carries
the meaning        specified          in   sec.    1-1181. 7 (16) .        For reasons that
should be all too obvious, an argument along these lines is one-
dimensional at best.
       In   our    quest       to     ascertain       the   true    meaning      of    the    word
"contractor," we note that it is being used in the context of a
bidder's responsibility.                   within the marketplace, we think it is
well-understood          that        in    responsibility         terms    a    determination
regarding     a    contractor's            experience       generally may,           and     indeed
should,     include          the    experience     of     its   officers       and    employees.
This is so because a main concern of the procuring officials is
whether the contractor has available to it the necessary persons
to perform the contract satisfactorily. See MMM, sec. 2620.18.B.2.
       We glean from the deliberations that assertedly went into
DPW's pol icy change               (although it is not expressly stated in the
record)     that it was likely the practice of the District to take
into   account         the    experience      of    a     roofing     firm's    personnel        in
determining the firm's experience until sometime in 1986 or 1987.
This observation raises several questions for which there appears
to be no answers in the record.                     When did the District adopt the
policy change          it says underlies Special Condition No.                          10?      In
this connection, we note that the District calls attention to a
memorandum        of    the        Director   of    the     DPW    dated    April      21,    1987
(approximately four months after the issuance of the IFB at issue
here), discussing the reasons for the change in policy but nowhere
stating when the change was actually made effective.                                   While we
                                                  -   9    -

know that Special Condition No. 10 appeared in the IFB (which, as
we mentioned earlier, was issued on December 16, 1986), the record

is silent as to when Special Condition No. 10 was first employed

in     DPW's    roofing        contracts.                 Did     the        same   text   of    Special
Condi tion No.         10 appear in DPW' s                     roofing contracts prior to the
adoption       of    the   new       policy?              If    not,    how did the         experience
requirement, if one was stated in the invitations, read?

        Irrespective of the answers to these questions,                                     given the

general        understanding          of     the       meaning          of     "contractor"      in   the
context of a bidder's responsibility,                              it was incumbent upon the
District, if it wished to convey a different and more restrictive
meaning,        to     draft     a        special         responsibility            provision      which
clearly eliminated any belief by the prospective bidders that they

could meet the experience requirement through their officers and

employees. 4         This could have readily been done by the District.

That    they     did    not    do     so     is       suspect and made more                 so by     the

District's conduct during the time the                                  instant procurement was
pending for contract award .
        On April 14, 1987, the DPW's Administrator made a nonrespon-
sibility       determination              with    respect         to     pinnacle's        bid   in   the

instant case because                 it    failed to meet the                   five years       roofing
experience requirement set forth in Special Condition No. 10.                                         See

Agency Report,          Exhibit B.               Less than a month earlier, March 18,
1987, Pinnacle, having bid on another solicitation put out by the

determine at the outset whether it would be worth their time and
expense to submit a bid and the likely scope of competition.

District      for     the provision of roofing work at the D.C.                      Police
Training Center, received notification from the District that the

"proposal       for    the     roofing      work     at   the   D.C.     Police    Training
Center, in strict accordance with the terms of said proposal . . .

was       accepted."      See    Protest,      Exhibit      10.        This   solicitation
included the identical Special Condition No.                       10 as contained in
the instant protest and provided for similar roofing work.                              See

Protest, Exhibits 12 and 13.                On May 6, 1987, a contract with

Pinnacle for the Police Training Center work was executed by the

District.       Exhibit 11, Protest.

          Thus, within a span of one month, the District placed itself
in    a    posture     where    it   made    two     diametrically       opposed    respon-
sibility determinations concerning Pinnacle's compliance with the
five      years experience requirement of Special                      Condition No.    10.

If Pinnacle did not meet the five years experience requirement at

the time of the instant procurement, it is inconceivable that it

met the       requirement       in the Police Training Center procurement.

The contradiction presented by these two determinations provides
further reason for us to eschew the interpretation of the term
"contractor" that the District urges upon us.
          Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that Special Condition
No.       10 did not     limit the evaluation of a                contractor's roofing

experience to the contractor itself,                      but rather permitted,         and

indeed required,         the District to include the relevant experience

of    the    contractor's       officers      and    employees     in determining       the

contractor's roofing experience.                   In reaching this conclusion, it
                                             -    11 -

is emphasized that we are not saying that the District's asserted
new policy exceeds permissible boundaries of discretion.                                  What we
do say is that the District failed to adequately state the new
policy in Special Condition No.                     10.         Hence,    the mere fact that
Pinnacle had not been previously in existence for five years as a
corporate entity should not have been dispositive of the question
of whether it met the five years roofing experience requirement.
     Laying aside the inconsistency in its application of Special
Condition       No.   10,       we   find        that     the      District's     statement      in
special      Condition No.            10 of its new policy is so lacking in
expression       as   to    make      its        reading      of    the   condition       and   the
application of its reading to Pinnacle unreasonable and therefore
arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of sec. 1-1189.8(e) (2).
This conduct resulted in Pinnacle not receiving the contract award
when it might have received the award had the District                                     (as it
should     have)      considered           the     relevant         roofing     experience       of
pinnacle's         officers          and    employees            when     it   was     evaluating
pinnacle's responsibility under Special Condition No. 10.
     THE    PROTEST        IS    SUSTAINED.              In   considering       the    matter    of
relief,    we      note     that     Pinnacle           has     requested      numerous    forms,
including    (1)      an order directing the District to terminate the
contract awarded to H&R and recompete the procurement and (2) an
order granting it reasonable bid preparation costs.                                   Termination

of the contract award is an option not available as a                                     form of
relief     because the contract was 75 percent complete a month after

the filing of this protest,                      a year and three months ago.                   We,
                                       - 12 -

therefore, grant Pinnacle's request for reasonable bid preparation
costs.
        Pinnacle may file with the Board, with a copy to be served
on    the    District,    a   bill    of   its    bid   preparation      costs,   not

including legal fees,           within twenty (20) working days after its

receipt of this decision.            The bill of costs shall be accompanied
by sufficient documentation supporting the costs being claimed.

The     District   may,   within     twenty      (20)   working   days    after   its
receipt of the bill of costs, file a written response thereto.
