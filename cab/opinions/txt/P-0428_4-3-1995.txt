                    OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS

Procedural History

      On January 18, 1995, V AIR Corporation ("Protestor" or "V AIR ") filed a protest of: (I)
Aggregate Award Group A -- titled "Replacement Parts," Items I through 40; and (2) Aggregate
Award Group J, Items 138 and 139 of Invitation for Bids No. 5123-95-EI-45-MM ("IFB").

        V AIR is protesting individual portions of the specifications contained in the IFB --
namely, (I) the requirement that bidders supply only Bell & Gosset ("B&G") Pump Parts
without any allowable substitutions for Items I through 40 of Aggregate Award Group A; and
(2) the fact that Aggregate Award Group J, Items 138 and 139 of the specifications "Iump[ ]
together" the Rudd Condensing Units and" A" coils. Also in relation to Award Group J, V AIR
protests the requirement that Rudd parts as opposed to Janitrol parts be utilized.

        Pursuant to Board Rule 306.1,36 D.C. Reg. 2713 (April 21, 1989), the District filed
a Motion to Dismiss on February 17, 1995. The District's Motion was on the ground that the
protest is outside of the Board's jurisdiction . The District contends that, in light of the fact that
the protest is based on defective specifications, the protest should have been filed prior to bid
opening: the protest is, therefore, untimely filed. See District's Motion to Dismiss.

         VAIR did not respond to the Motion to Dismiss. Pursuant to Board Rule 307.4,36 D.C.
Reg. 2714 (1989), when a Protestor fails to file comments on an agency report or dispositive
motion filed in lieu thereof, the factual allegations in the protest that are not admitted by the
District, or otherwise corroborated on the record, may be disregarded. Alternatively, in
accordance with Board Rule 110.5, 36 D.C. Reg. 2692 (1989), in light of Protestor's failure to
file a timely opposition to the District's motion, the Board may, if it so chooses, treat the motion
as conceded. Heller Elecrric Co., Inc., CAB NO . P-244, December 23, 1991,39 D.C. Reg.

4373; Barcode Technolo~ies, Inc., CAB No . P-298, January 16, 1992,39 D.C. Reg. 4387. In
this case, as will be discussed below, since the Board has determined that the protest is not
timely filed, it will not be necessary for the Board to determine whether it should disregard any
or all of the f3r.tual allegations.



       On December 29, 1994, the Department of Public and Assisted Housing ("DPAH")
issued the IFB to provide DPAH heating and air conditioning supplies and parts on an
emergency basis. District's Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit I. The solicitation required that bids
be submitted by and set bid opening for January 9, 1995 at 9:00 a.m. Id.

        On January 9, 1995 , seven bids were received and opened -- including the bid of YAIR.
District's Motion to Dismiss, Exhibits 2 and 3.

        In Aggregate Group "A "--" Replacement Parts," for Items I through 40, YAIR's bid
substituted Armstrong parts for the B&G parts specified on the IFB form. District's Motion to
Dismiss, Exhibit 3.

        On January 18, 1995, YAIR filed the above-captioned protest with the Board .

Decision

        The Board finds the protest to be untimely filed. In keeping with the traditional rule of
law in federal protest tribunals, the Board has held that "in order to timely challenge the terms
of a solicitation, the protest must be tiled prior to the closing date for receipt of proposals or bid
opening. " Unjoldmenf , Inc., CAB No. P-358, September 17, 1993,41 D.C. Reg. 3656, 3659,

39 D.C. Reg. 4447. Bid opening in this matter was held on January 9, 1995. The Protestor
did not file the instant protest until January 18, 1995.

       ACCORDINGLY, based upon the facts, legal precedent and reasoning set forth above,
the protest is hereby DISMISSED, with prejudice.
