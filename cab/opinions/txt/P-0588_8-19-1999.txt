                                               OPINION

         Health Right, Inc., filed a protest challenging the District's decision to enter into a novation
 agreement pursuant to 27 DCMR § 1220, recognizing Amerigroup Corporation as the successor in
 interest to Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., under a Medicaid managed care contract executed by
 the District on July 31, 1997. Health Right argues that the novation agreement violates: (1) a
 District Medicaid regulation, 29 DCMR § 5317.1, which prohibits certain Medicaid providers from
 assigning or transferring contract rights; (2) federal anti-kickback provisions in 42 U .S.C. § 1320a-
 7b(b); (3) D.C. Code § 1-1130(b)(1), which requires Council approval of contracts valued in excess
 of$I,OOO,OOO; and (4) a Board order in a prior protest, Health Right, Inc., CAB NoS. P-507, et al.,
 Oct. 15, 1997, 45 D.C. Reg. 8612. The Dist~ict and the intervenor hive filed motions to dismiss the
,protest for lac,k of jurisdiction. Tlie intervenor has also moved to disqualify the protester's counsel.
 Under the 'circumstances presented here, we conclude that neither the execution of the novation
 agreement nor the transfer of the underlying managed care contract constitutes "an award of a
 contract" for purposes of our protest jurisdiction as defined in D.C. Code § 1-1189.3(a)(1).
 Accordingly, we dismiss the protest. The motion to disqualify counsel is moot.

                                          BACKGROUND

       On July 31, 1997, the District executed contracts with Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., and
other managed care contractors to provide managed care services for the District's Medicaid
program. As a result of earlier protests of those awards, and our decision on those' protests, see
Health Right, Inc., CAB Nos. P-507, et al., Oct. 15, 1997,45 D.C. Reg. 8612, the District executed
contracts with the protesters, including Health Right, on March 10, 1998. (District's Motion to
Dismiss, filed July 22, 199,9, Ex. 2).

                                                                        •
                                                                       Health Right, Inc., CAB No. P-588
                                                                                                           [7771]




        On February 11, 1999, Prudential and Amerigroup entered into an asset purchase agreement
under which Prudential agreed to sell to Amedgroup all of its right, title, and interest in the District
Medicaid business and all assets used in the District Medicaid business. (Id., Ex. 3). In letters of
May 12, 1999, and May 27, 1999, to the District's Chief Procurement Officer ("CPO"), Health Right
requested the District's position with regard to Amerigroup's asset purchase of Prudential Health
Care Plan and whether the assignment or transfer of Prudential's Medicaid managed care contract
was legally valid. (Protest, Attachment 1). By letter of June 17, 1999, a District contracting officer
responded to Health Right, stating that District regulations would not permit Prudential to
unilaterally assign. its Medicaid managed care contract to Amerigrdup but that other District
regulations at 27 DCMR § 1220 "permit dnovation where a District contractor has been transferred
or purchased by another entity." (Protest, Attachment 2). The contracting officer advised Health
Right that the District would contact Prudential "to ascertain whether it is necessary or appropriate
for the District to enter into a novation with Prudential and AmeriGroup .... " (Id.).

        On July 1" 1999, Health Right filed the captioned protest. On July 16 and July 22, 1999,
Prudential and the District filed motions to dismiss the protest. Prudential also moved to disqualify
the law firm representing Health Right on the ground that a partner who recently joined the firm had
previously represented Prudential in the asset purchase transaction with Amerigroup, which,
according to Prudential, creates an irremediable conflict of interest.

        On July 22,1999, the District filed a July 21,1999 determination and findings to proceed
                                                               I

with entering into a novation agreement with Prudential and Amerigroup during the pendency of the
protest. On July 30, 1999, Health Right moved to void the July 21 determination. On July 28, 1999,
the District filed the novation agreement executed by the Prudential, Amerigroup, and the District,
to be effective August 1, 1999.

                                           DISCUSSION

       The Board's protest jurisdiction is defined by D.C. Code § 1-1189.3 (1999) as follows:

       (a) The Board shall be the exclusive hearing tribunal for, and shall have jurisdiction
         , to review and determine de novo:

           (1) Any protest of a solicitation or award of a contract addressed to the Board
       by any actual or prospective bidder or offeror, or a contractor who is aggrieved in
       connection with the solicitation or award of a contract ....

District procurement regulations define a novation agreement as:

       a h~gai instrument executed by a contractor (transferor), the successor in 'interest
       (transferee), and the District by which, among other things, the District recognizes
       the transfer of the contract and related assets.

27 DCMR § 1299.1. The regulations governing novation and change-of-n~me agreements, found

                                                                            .'
                                                                           Health Right, Inc., CAB No. P-588
                                                                                                               [7772]




  at 27 DCMR §§ 1220.1 to 1220.9, address novation in terms of the transfer ofa contract from one
  entity to another with the concurrence of the contracting officer. Section 1220.6 states:

          If recognizing a successor in interest[] to a District contract is consistent with the best
          interest of the District, the responsible contracting officer shall execute a novation
          agreement with the transferor and the transferee.

  As the regulations make clear, a novation agreement is the transfer of preexisting contract rights and
  responsibilities. Although the novation agreement is itself a type of contract, it is not a contract
  "awarded" in the sense covered by D.C. Code § 1-1189.3(a)(1). Under the circumstances here, the
  transfer of the managed care contract from Prudential to Amerigroup effected by the novation also
  does not constitute an "award" ofa contract under section 1-1189.3(a)(1). Two years have passed
  between the District's manage care contract award to Prudential and the novation of the contract to
  Amerigroup. There is no evidence that the DistHct made the 1997 award to Prudential with the
  intention of entering into a novation agreement transferring the contract to Amerigroup. Thus, the
  novation here is a matter of contract administration arid does not relate to a contract award. See, e.g.,
  Bosma Machine & Tool Corp., B-257443.2, Oct. 17, 1994,94-2 CPD ~ 143:

         Health Right responds that a novation agreement for a Medicaid managed care contract is
  prohibited by, 29 DCMR § 5317.1,42 D.C. Reg. 1586 (Mar. 31,1995), which provides:

         No prepaid, capitated provider shall assign or transfer any right gained by qualifying
         as a contractor with the Department.

  We agree with the intervenor that the June 17, 1999 letter from the Department of Health's chief
  contracting, officer reflects an in~erpretatio~ by the agency authorized to interpret the Medicaid
  regulations that section 5317.1 prohibits the transfer of a District Medicaid managed care contract
  from one contractor to another without District approval, but does not prohibit a transfer which is
  approved by the District through a novation agreement. We believe such an interpretation is
  reasonable.

          We need not address whether the novation agreement violates the anti-kickback provisions
  of 42 U .S.C. § 1320a-7b(b). That matter can be addressed in the first instance by the federal officials
  who are vested with authority to apply and enforce those provisions. The record indicates that the
  District's Department of Health has taken or will take appropriate measures to ensure that the
  novated Medicaid managed care contract meets applicable federal requirements and any required
  approvals from the Health Care Finance Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and
  Human Services.




, tNo Board order in the consolida~edprotests of CAB Nos. P-507, 1>-510, and P-511, prohibited the
  District from subsequently entering into a novation agreement relating to a managed care contract.

                                        CONCLUSION

        For the reasons discussed above, we dismiss Health Right's protest and deny its motion to
void the determination to proceed with the novation. The motion to disqualify counsel is moot.
