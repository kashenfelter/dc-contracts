                                               OPINION

        H. R. General Maintenance Corporation ("HR") protests the proposed award of Contract No. 98-
0053-AA-4-0-CC for Masonry and Other Repairs at ten libraries in the District of Columbia to the
apparent low bidder, OMF Contractors, Inc. rOMF"). H.R. claims that OMF is not a responsible
contractor for the performance ofthis work, and that OMF's bid bond is defective, rendering OMF's bid
non-responSIve. The protest is without merit.

                                            BACKGROUND

        The District of Columbia Department ofPublic Works, Division ofFacilities Management Services
("DPW") issued IFB No. 98-0053-AA-4-0-CC ("IFB") on July 31, 1998, seeking bids for masonry and
other repair work at ten public library buildings throughout the District. 1 Addendum No.1, which
provided revised Technical Specifications for the work, was issued on August 21, 1998. Bid opening
occurred on August 31, 1998. DPW n~ceived seven (7) bids with OMF's being the apparent lowest at
$199,000. The second low bidder was HR with a bid 0[$298,440. The other bids ranged from $437,000
to $549,000.

        On September 11, 1998, HR filed a timely protest, challenging OMF' s ability to perform the work,
and the validity of OMF's bid bond. Based on a Dun & Bradstreet Report ("D&B Report") received on
September 8, 1998, HR claimed that OMF is primarily a painting and ceramic tile contractor, not a
masonry contractor and does not possess the requisite experience or responsibility to perform the contract.
The D&B Report contains information, dated March 24, 1998, that OMF specializes in painting, carpentry



       lThe Martin Luther King Li~~ary and the following branch libraries are slated for repair:
Benning, Southeast, Anacostia, Cleveland Park, Tenley-Friendship, Northeast, Woodridge, Takoma
Park and Petworth.                                          "

                                                           H R General Mamtenance Corp., CAB No P-557
                                                                                                                 [7659]




and concrete work. (D&B Report, at 4, Attachment to Protest). As further evidence ofOMF's non-
responsibility, HR claims that OMF' s bid price, which is almost $100,000 lower that HR' sand $157,000
lower than the government cost estimate ($356,100) demonstrates that OMF does not understand the
requirements of the IFB and cannot perform the work as bid. On October 1, 1998, the District filed its
Agency Report ("AR") informing the Board that DPW was investigating OMF's responsibility and
requesting that the Board defer action on the protest, because the issue ofresponsibility was not ripe for
review. On November 3, 1998, the District faxed to the Board a letter, dated September 14, 1998, in
which OMF confirmed that it could perform according to the specifications ofthe contract for the proposed
sum of $199,000. (See Report on Telephone Conference, Nov. 3, 1998).

          The District did not permit HR to see OMF's bid at the bid opening. Thus, HR alleged, upon
information and belief, that OMF' s corporate secretary had not certified the signature ofOMF' s President
on the bid bond form and that OMF had failed to affix its corporate seal to the bid bond, rendering OMF' s
bid non-responsive. HR saw OMF' s bid bond for the first time on October 1, 1998, the date that the
District filed its Agency Report (Agency Report "AR"). OMF's corporate seal is affixed to the bid bond
(although undecipherable on the Board's copy). However, no portion ofthe "Certificate of Corporation"
is filled in. After reviewing a copy ofOMF' s bid bond, HR identified other errors, which HR raised as
additional grounds of protest. 2 OMF listed "MO" (Maryland) as the "State oflncorporation" in its bid
bond, while it states in its Bid Form that it is incorporated in the District. OMF also listed the date of bid
opening as "11/31/98", although the actual bid opening date was August 31, 1998. HR argues that
cumulatively, these defects render OMF' s bid bond non-responsive. With respect to the bid bond issues,
the District argues that the defects in the bid bond are minor defects, which the contracting officer may
properly waive. The District states that it "will receive the full and complete protection it contemplated in
the event 0 MF fails to execute the required contact documents and deliver the required performance and
payment bonds." (AR, at 4).

        On January 5, 1999, the District filed a "Determination and Findingfor Contractor's Responsibility
and Competitive Sealed Bid Award ("Responsibility D&F") which the Contracting Officer signed on
November 16, 1998. The Contracting Officer found that OMF had previously performed satisfactory
work for DPW, was financially sound, and had the requisite financial assets to perform the work and to
acquire the necessary payment and performance bonds. The Responsibility D&F also states that OMF
provided several references who vouched for the quality of its work, workmanship, timeliness of


       2The District never rebutted HR's assertion, or explained why HR, an interested party, was not
permitted to examine OMF's bid at the time of bid opening in accordance with 27 DCMR § 1527.4:
"Examination of bids by interested persons shall be permitted ifit does not interfere unduly with the
conduct of District business .... " Therefore, we find that the new grounds of protest are timely filed
within 10 days ofHR's receipt of the Agency Report, when the basis of the new grounds of protest
were known. (Board Rule 302.2(b), 45 D.C. Reg. 1415 (Mar. 13, 1998)).

performance, resources, including skilled manpower, tools and equipment, responsiveness and contract
compliance. The references also confirmed that OMF had the requisite skills and experience to perform
the contract work. In sum, the Contracting Officer reports:

        The contractor's past and currenfperformance records ofintegrity and business ethics,
        sound financial capability and work experience are indicative of the contractor's
        qualifications and we have found them to be responsible.

          On January 12, 1999, HR challenged the Responsibility D&F arguing that it did not comply with
27 DCMR § 2200.5, which permits the contracting officer to find a prospective bidder nonresponsible if
its bid is so low as to appear unrealistic. HR also argues that the Responsibility D&F did not address the
following regulatory requirements:

        (b) Ability to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule,
        taking into consideration all existing commercial and governmental business commitments;

        (e) The necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, and
        technical skills, or the ability to obtai~ the'm;

        (g) The necessary production, construction and technical equipment and facilities, or the
        ability to obtain them.

27 DCMR § 2200.4. Moreover, HR questions why the District did not provide a statement from 0 MF
regarding the firm's organization, experience and technical skills or the ability to obtain them. (protester's
Comments on the District's Responsibility D&F, at 4). On January 27, 1999, the District responded that
DPW had complied with all necessary procurement regulations. Attached to its response is a copy of
OMF's Financial Statement and an Affidavit of the DPW employee who actually prepared the
Responsibility D&F. (Response to the Protester's Comments on the District's D&F for Contractor's
Responsibility, Exhibits 2 and 3).

                                                DECISION

        We exercise protest jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1189.3 (Supp. 1998).

        We have stated on many occasions that, while there is no presumption of agency correctness under
our de novo standard of review, we accord contracting officers broad discretion in the exercise oftheir
duty to determine whether a prospective contractor is responsible. See e.g. Kidd International Home

Reg. 4528; C.P.F Corp., CAB No. P-413, Nov.18, 1994,42 D.C. Reg. 4902. Since the contracting
officer must bear the brunt ofany difficulties in obtaining the required performance, we will not disturb an
affirmative responsibility determination unless the protester demonstrates fraud or bad faith on the part of
the contracting officials, a failure by a prospective contractor to adhere to definitive responsibility criteria,
or that the responsibility determination lacks any reasonable basis. Id at Central Armature/Fort Nyer.
HR has not alleged that this matter involves definitive responsibility criteria, fraud or bad faith. Instead, HR
appears to challenge the documentation of the District's Responsibility D&F. While the contracting
officer's judgment must be documented in sufficient detail to show that there is a reasonable basis for it,
failure of a determination and findings to discuss every detail ofa contractor's responsibility does not affect
the validity of the determination if the record shows that the decision is reasonable.

        Upon careful review of the record, we find sufficient documentation to support the affirmative
responsibility determination made by DPW's contracting officer. In particular, we find that the information
about OMF' s past timely and satisfaetory performance of significant contract work for the District and
other governmental and private entities, which included masonry work similar to what is required in this
contract, was information upon which the contracting officer could reasonably determine that OMF was
responsible. In particular, it was reasonable for the contracting officer to find that OMF, a company that
has successfully operated for nine years, "had the ability to comply with the required or proposed delivery
or performance schedule ..... " [27 DCMR 2200.4(b)]; "[t]he necessary organization, experience,
accounting and operational controls and technical skills [27 DCMR § 2200.4(e)]; and [t]he necessary
production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities .... " In addition, OMF's financial
statement as well as the D&B Report indicates an adequate financial position supporting the view that OMF
would have the ability to obtain any ofthe technical skills or equipment necessary to successfully complete
this contract.

        HR's allegation that OMF' s bid price is lmrealistically low concerns OMF' s ability to perform the
contract at its proposed price, a matter ofaffirmative responsibility. A responsible bidder for a fixed price
contract may offer below-cost pricing, as the submission of a below cost offer is not illegal. D&L
Construction Co. Inc., B-279132, May 11, 1998, 98-1 CPD ~ 136; Hellenic Technodomiki, SA., B-
265931, Jan. 18, 1996, 96-1 CPD~91. OMF, whose bid was substantially below the District's estimate
and HR's bid, confirmed its bid price on September 14,1998. (Response to Protester's Comments on
the District's D&F for Contractor's Responsibility, Exh.l). OMF has accepted the risk and responsibility
of any potential loss. The contracting officer properly exercised his discretion by not rejecting OMF' s bid
as unrealistically low. Again, these contracting officer emphasizes that OMF understands the scope of
work, has the expertise to perform the work and "the assets required to provide the required performance
and payment bonds which assures that the District will be provided satisfactory completion ofthe work."
(Responsibility D&F).

        We now address the issues raised about OMF's bid bond. A bid bond is a written instrument
executed by a bidder and a surety to guarantee the fulfillment of the contractor's obligation to the
government. The bid bond secure~ the surety's liability to the government to pay the excess costs of
awarding the contract to the next eligIble bidder in the event that the awardee fails to fulfill its obligation to
execute a written contract. Ifa bidder submits a defective bid bond, the bid itselfis rendered defective and
the bid must be rejected. HR. General Maintenance Corp., CAB No. P-545, Oct. 9, 1998, 10 P.O.
7611; Ft. Myer Construction Corp, CAB No. P-452, July 23, 1996,44 D.C. Reg. 6476. (Citations
omitted). When a bid is alleged to be defective, the determinative issue is whether the surety has sufficiently
manifested an intention to be bound so that the bond would be enforceable.Id We think that 0 MF' s bid
bond binds the surety to the bid obligation, notwithstanding the technical deficiencies which may be
corrected after the bid opening or waived. The important facts are that OMF' s bid bond identifies the
correct penal amount, is signed by its President, with a corporate seal affixed, identifies the correct
invitation number, and the surety has expressed its intention to be bound.

         On the first page ofDPW's Bid Bond Form, under the "BID IDENTIFICATION" area, there
are two blocks to fill out: one for the "BID OPENING DATE" under which OMF incorrectly wrote
"11/31/98"; and one for the "INVITATION NO." under which OMF correctly wrote the IFB number.
In addition, at the top of the form, bidders are instructed to fill out a block entitled "DATE BOND
EXECUTED (Must not be Later Than Bid Opening Date). In this area, OMF correctly recorded
the date of bid opening as August 31, 1998. There is clear indicia on the face of the bond to identify the
correct date and the solicitation to which the bond applies, notwithstanding this apparent typographical
error. The incorrect bid opening date does not affect the enforceability of the bond and may be waived
as a minor irregularity. See Kirila Cons tractors, Inc., 67 Compo Gen. 455, 88-1 CPO ~ 554 (holding
that an incorrect solicitation number is merely a technical error). The failure to fill in the "Certificate of
Corporation" in this bond is also a minor deficiency. The signature of the President of 0 MF was attested
to and OMF' s corporate seal affixed. The corporate seal establishes prima facie that an instrument is the
duly authorized act of the corporati.: n and is not easily overcome. See Daley Corporation-California
Commercial Asphalt, B-274203, Dec. 9,1996, 96-2 CPD~217, citingFletcherCyc. Corp., §§ 2470-
2473 (Perm. Ed.); 18A Am. Jur. 2d 214, Corporations Sec. 304. Even though the instructions require
the corporate secretary to fill in and sign the "Certificate of Corporation", we do not regard the signature
or the information as a material requirement with which the bidder must comply in order to be responsive
where, as here, the bond is signed, sealed, and submitted with a signed bid. Finally, the discrepancy
between the Bid Form and the bid bond regarding the place ofincorporation is a technical deficiency which
does not call into question whether the surety was actually bound. Moreover, examination ofthe corporate
seal will reveal the actual state of incorporation. The errors to which HR directs our attention are only
technical deficiencies which do not affect the liability ofthe surety. DPW was not required to reject OMF' s
bid as nonresponsive on these grounds.
