                                              CONTRACT APPEALS BOARD


                 PROTEST OF:

                         A BETTER ALTERNATIVE , INC.

                         Under IFB/CF 012-86


                                                     SUMMARY OF DECISION

                         1.          It is a      basic tenet of government procurement law

                 that bidders are responsible for the timely delivery of their

                 bids    to     the    proper       place    at    the      proper      time,       and    the   late

                 delivery of a bid generally requires its rejection.

                         2.         Bid    opening     off icer' s       declaration           of    bid     opening

                 time    in     the    presence       of    one    other procurement                official and

                 other bidders is determinative of the lateness of protester's

                 bid where the bid was first received after bid opening and the

                 bid opening officer has confirmed the accuracy of the time by

                 a   telephonic            report     in    the    presence        of      other      procurement

                 officials,           in    the     absence       of     evidence        corroborating            the

                 statement of protester as to when the bid was first submitted

                 to the procurement officials.

                         3.         A late hand-carried bid may be considered for award

                 where        the    principal       cause    of       delay   is       wrongful          government

                 action        and     its        consideration          would       not      compromise          the

                 integrity of the District's competitive procurement system.

                         4.         Where         protester        failed          to        arrive         at    the

                 Department's bid opening room with its hand-carried bid before

                 bid    opening        time    and    received         answers       f rom    the     procurement

                 official which were                 responsive        to    the    protester's            questions
and were not inaccurate or misleading, the protester's failure

to arrive timely at the bid opening room and to ask the proper

questions of the procurement officials was the principal cause

for its bid being submitted late.

       5.      Procurement        officials         lacked    authority         to   accept

late    hand-carried        bid    where      protester's         actions        were    the

principal cause of the late submission, and no action by the

procurement officals could negate the rule that a late hand-

carried bid must be rejected.

       6.      Rule    regarding        late        hand-carried         bids     must    be

strictly enforced          in order to be            fair    to   other       bidders who

submitted timely bids and to maintain public confidence in the

integrity of the District's competitive bidding system.

                                       DECISION

       A Better Alternative,           Inc.     (Better Alternative)              protests

the    rejection of        its    hand-carried bid as             late       under   IFB/CF

012-86 (IFB),      issued by the Department of Employment Services

for the procurement of recording and transcription services.

       According      to   the    (IFB),      bid    opening      was    scheduled       for

2:00    p.m.    on     September        22,     1986.        Better          Alternative's

president stated in her protest letter of September 23, 1986,

that because the IFB did not state where the bid opening would

take   place,    or    that      the   bid    opening        would      be    public,    she

called the contact person named in the IFB on the date of bid

opening but prior to the time set for the opening of bids and

was informed by the person she was referred to that the bid

opening was     public and would be held                    in Room 216B.            Better



                              - 2 -
Alternative's           president,           therefore,          hand-carried           Better

Alternative's bid to Room 216B.                     The president states that she

arrived at the Department of Employment Services at 1:54 p.m.

and went di rectly to Room 216B where she attempted to place

her   bid   in    the    basket       with     the       other   bids.       Because       the

president did not have a time-stamped slip for the bid, the

bid opening officials refused to accept the bid and instructed

her to go to Room 417 to obtain one. After a brief conversa-

tion with the bid opening officials and not wanting to delay

further,    the    president proceeded                   to   Room   417,   repeated       her

story    and     obtained       a    slip     time-stamped           at   2:04    p.m.     See

Exhibit A (time-stamped [sic] 2:04 a.m.) to counsel for Better

Alternative's       letter      to     the    Board       dated November          24,    1986.

She then walked back to Room 216B and was informed that Better

Alternatives bid still would not be accepted.

        Better Alternative contends that its bid should have been

accepted because the                IFB did not state where the bid opening

would be held and because the president was given incomplete

information when she called to find out where the bid opening

would be held.          Better Alternative also contends that but for

the   incomplete        information          the    president        says   she    received

from the procurement contact person, Better Alternative's bid

would have been timely stamped.                         Moreover, Better Alternative

asserts that the          bid       opening    officer         had the      discretion to

accept the bid but failed to do so because he was influenced

by    the   unfavorable             remarks        of    another      bidder.           Better

Alternative further argues that the IFB does not state where



                                    - 3 -
hand-carried             bids     are    to    be     delivered.               Finally,         Better
Alternative         contends that the time the president arrived in

Room    216B       was    1 :58    p.m.        See    Better        Alternative's              protest

letter and          letter of           counsel      for    Better Alternative                  to the

Board dated November 21, 1986.

       The     Department           contends          that        it     acted        properly         in

rejecting          Better       Alternative's             bid    and     responds         to    Better

Alternative's contentions by stating that:

       1.          The    bid     opening       officer          confirmed          with       the    C&P

Telephone Co. time service the time on the wall clock in Room

417 and on his watch, and this confirmation was witnessed by

two other contract specialists;

       2.          The    bid     opening       officer,          accompanied          by      another

contract       specialist,          arrived          in     Room       216B    several         minutes

before the scheduled bid opening time;

       3.          The contract specialist in Room 417 advised the bid

opening officer and the contract specialist accompanying him

that he would bring to Room 216B any bids                                     received by 2:00
p.m. in Room 417;

       4.          The     bid    opening       was        announced          and    initiated         at
exactly 2:00 p.m. by the bid opening officer;

       5.          The bid opening off icer had announced the name of

the bidder of the first bid opened, verified the completeness

of     the     bid,        announced          the     bid        prices,            recorded         this

information         on     the     Bid    Tabulation            Sheet     and       had     opened      a

second       bid    after        having       announced          the    bidder's          name       when




                                                                - 4 -
Better Alternative's president arrived and stated she had come

to submit her bid;

      6.     The     bid    opening         officer     and    contract        specialist

informed    Better     Alternative's            president       that      since      it   was

after 2:00 p.m., her bid would not be accepted and that bids

were to have been submitted to and time-stamped in Room 417.

      7.     The      contract         specialist           responsible        for      time-

stamping bids in Room 417 asked the bid opening off icer the

time Better Alternative's president arrived in Room 216B and

was told she had first arrived there after 2:00 p.m.;

      8.     The     location        for      receiving       bids     (Room     417)     was

never changed;

      9.     The     location         for      bid     delivery/receipt           and     bid

opening were       in two separate rooms,               Room 417 and Room 216B,

respectively;

      10.    The delivery/receipt of                   bids and      bid    opening are

not synonymous; and

      11.    The president of Better Alternative arrived in Room

417 at approximately 2:04 p.m.                   on the date         of    bid opening.

See   Department's         Report     of       Facts,       memorandum      of    Franklin

Austin,     Contract        Specialist          to     Melford       G.    Brown        dated

September     22,     1986,     Memorandum             of     Sharon       Ogunfiditimi,

and   memorandum      of     James          Jenkins,     Contract         Specialist       to

Melford Brown dated September 22, 1986.

      It is a       basic tenet of government procurement law that

bidders are responsible for the timely delivery of their bids




                                    - 5 -
to the proper place at the proper time, and the late delivery

of a bid generally requires its rejection.                    Nanco Labs Inc.,

B-220663; B-220664, November 27,             1985, 85-2 C.P.D. ,613 at 2.

See    also   Material   Management     Manual       (MMM),      §§2620. 8A. 1 and

2620.9E.

       The    record   indicates     that    Better       Alternative     and   the

Department      disagree   as   to    the     time     Better      Alternative's

president arrived at Room 216B (the bid opening room).                       Under

the MMM, §2620.11B, the official designated as the bid opening

officer decides when the time set for bid opening has arrived

and shall so declare to those present.                    The MMM also states
that:

       "[t]he official clock which determines when the time
       for opening bids has arrived shall be that which is
       located and so identified in the room containing the
       bid deposit safe.    The official designated as bid
       opening officer shall be responsible for determining
       the accuracy of the clock not less often than once
       per week by utilizing the 'time' service provided by
       the telephone company."

MMM, §2620.11B.2. Here, the bid opening officer, before going

to the bid opening room, states that he confirmed the time of

the wall clock in the room where bids were to be received and
kept and the time on his watch by a telephonic time report and

that   this    confirmation was      witnessed       by    two    other   contract

specialists.      The bid opening officer also states that at 2:00

p.m.   (the time set for bid opening), he announced bid opening

in the accompaniment of one other contract specialist and two

venders in the bid opening room and commenced the bid opening

procedure.      The bid opening officer further states that the

Better Alternative's president              first arrived with her bid in



                                             - 6 -
the bid opening room while he was opening the second bid after

having announced the name of the bidder.
        There       is     nothing        in      the     record          contradicting             these

statements           other        than           the      representation                 of     Better

Alternative's president and its argument that logic dictates

that    the     alleged      arrival            time    of     the       president       at    the    bid

opening room (1:58 p.m.)                   must be accurate in view of (1)                            the

fact    that        the    bid    was      stamped           at    2:04     p.m.     in       Room    417

following       a    short verbal exchange between the president and

the    bid     opening      officials            in     Room       216B    and     (2)    the       short

distance        between          Room      216B        and        Room     417.          See    Better

Alternative's             protest          letter            and         counsel     for        Better

Alternative's letter dated November                                21,    1986,    to the       Board.

        In view of the statements of the bid opening officer and

the    other     two      contract specialists and                        the     undisputed         time

Better Alternative's bid was stamped, the Board concludes that

the preponderance of the evidence in the record indicates that

Better Alternative's bid was first submitted to the Department

after the time for bid opening.                          Stated differently, the Board
finds that the             record does not corroborate the statement of
Better Alternative's president that she arrived at Room 216B a

few     minutes          before     2:00         p.m.     Therefore,             although       Better
Alternative          contends      that         its     president arrived                at the       bid

opening       room       prior    to     the      scheduled          bid    opening       time,       the

Board     is        constrained           to      accept          the      statements          of     the

Department's two contract specialists that the president first

arrived at the bid opening room after the time for bid opening



                                        - 7 -
had    been     declared          and    the     commencement       of   the     bid    opening

procedure.            The    Board,         therefore,         concludes       that     the    bid

opening       off icer' s     declaration          of     bid    opening       time,    in    this

case, is determinative of the lateness of Better Alternative's

bid.      Even assuming             that the        preponderance         of    the evidence

does    not    favor        the    District       on     the    issue    of    lateness,       the

Board concludes             that when the           only evidence on an                issue of

fact consists of conflicting statements between the protester

and the procuring agency, the protester has not satisfied its

burden of proof.

        The Board recognizes that there may be situations where a

protester's        late           hand-carried          bid     should        nonetheless       be

considered for award,                   for example,       where the principal cause

of delay is wrongful government action and                               consideration of

the bid would not compromise the integrity of the District's

competitive procurement                   system.         Under    these       circumstances,

"wrongful government action" would be some affirmative action

on the Department's part,                   such as improper or conflicting bid

delivery instructions,                  which would have made timely delivery

of Better Alternative's hand-carried bid impossible. See Nanco

Labs Inc., supra at 2 and 3.

        Better Alternative argues                   that       "[i]nformation regarding

hand-carried bids             in     response       to    IFB/CF    012-86       [the    IFB    in

question] is not addressed anywhere in Instructions to Bidders

in said       IFB."         See    counsel        for    Better Alternative's            letter

dated    November           21,     1986.         See     also     Better       Alternative's

protest letter where the president states:



                                         - 8 -
        I agree that the instructions for mailing in
        proposals was printed on the first page of the IFB,
        however, the IFB did not at all address the issue of
        where bid opening would be held, so I had no
        recourse but to call and find out. (Underlining
        original. )

The Board also was unable to find any expressed provisions in

the IFB stating where hand-carried bids could be delivered or

where bid opening would be and feels                       that the       inclusion of

such information in IFBs would be beneficial to the bidders.

The Board,         however,    is of the view that Better Alternative's
concern about the lack of information in the IFB is untimely.

The IFB was issued on August 20,                   1986, and clearly indicates

where    bids      were   to    be   mailed,       and,    if   Better     Alternative

objected to the absence of other information,                       it should have

protested much earlier than it did.                       See D. C. Code 1981, § 1-

1189.8(b)      (1986 Supp.), which requires a protest to be filed
with the Board within ten working days after the person knew

or should have known of the facts and circumstances upon which
the protest is based.            See also CAB Proposed Rule 300.4.

        In   any    event,     the   Board will       examine      the    question    of
whether      any    District         government      personnel     engaged     in    any

wrongful action which principally caused Better Alternative's
bid     to   be     delivered        late     as   the     Board    has     previously
determined.         The president states in her protest letter:

              The bid opening information printed on the
        face of the IFB did not include the location in
        which the bid opening would take place, nor did it
        indicate whether or not the bid opening was public.
        I, consequently, called Mr. Melford Brown's office
        (the contact indicated on the face of the IFB) for
        the purpose of finding these things out and was
        referred to a Mr. Austin who informed me that the
        bid opening was public and would be held in room
        216B.

See     also    letter        of    counsel          for    Better       Alternative       dated
November 24,1986.                  The president also stated in her protest

letter that, "[b]ut for the incomplete information I received

from Mr.       Austin,        our    proposal           [bid]    would have       been timely

stamped."         Counsel           for        Better      Alternative      argues        in   his

correspondence           to     the       Board         that         "Mr.        Austin    acted

improperly in incorrectly advising Bidder to proceed to room

216B and as a           result of his misfeasance, Bidder has suffered

adversely . "         The Board disagrees.

        Irrespective of the efficacy of the instructions given by

Mr.    Austin to Better Alternative's president,                                 the president

states she understood his instructions to mean that she should

come to room 216B to deliver or submit her bid.                                     Proceeding

with this understanding, the president nevertheless arrived at

room 216B after the bid opening time as previously determined

by the Board.            So by any construction given to the instruc-

tions    of     Mr.     Austin,       he       did   not       principally       cause    Better

Alternative's bid to be late.                           Moreover,    the Board does not

find     that     Mr.     Austin           gave      the       president     misleading          or
incorrect instructions.                   The president simply asked Mr. Austin

where bid opening would                    be and whether           it would        be public.

She did not ask where a hand-carried bid could be submitted or
whether her hand-carried bid could be submitted at the place

where bid opening would occur.                       Mr. Austin accurately answered

the questions presented to him.                            The Board finds nothing in

the    record     that     leads          it    to   believe      that     Mr.    Austin       said

anything which would cause the president to reasonably think




                                      - 10 -
that    hand-carried            bids       should      be    submitted        in    Room       216B.

Under    the    circumstances,               Mr.     Austin     would      have      had       to    be

clairvoyant          to   perceive           that     the    president        may       have    been

unfamiliar          (as   she     apparently          was)    with     the    fact       that       bid

opening       and     bid       submission          normally        occurred       at     separate

locations, and, therefore, she really may have been intending

to ask, among other things, where a hand-carried bid could be

submitted.          In other words, Better Alternative bears the risk

and the attendant consequences for failing to form and present

the proper question to the Department's procurement officials.

For    these    reasons          the    Board       cannot     conclude        that       improper

government or department action was the principal reason that

Better       Alternative         was     unable       to     submit    its     bid       on    time.

Rather, the Board concludes that Better Alternative's failure

to arrive timely at the Department's facilities and to ask the

proper questions            was      the     principal cause           for    its       bid being

submitted late.             The Board thinks it would have been prudent

for    the    president,          who      was      apparently       unfamiliar          with       the

usual procedure for the submission and opening of bids, either

to have called the appropriate procurement official and asked

more pointed questions or to have arrived in sufficient time

to allow for unpredicted situations she might encounter.                                             If

the    president          had     followed          either     of     these    alternatives,

Better Alternative's bid may not have been submitted late.

        Finally, Better Alternative asserts in its protest letter

that "[Mr. Austin's] decision not to accept the proposal [bid]

was    discretionary            on     its    face,     based       upon     what       ultimately



                                                    - 11 -
transpired,          and      influenced        by      the   remarks      of     the     other

bidder."      (Underlining original.)                   There is no evidence in the

record        that     Mr.           Austin's     decision           to    reject       Better

Alternative's bid was influenced by the comments of the other

bidders'       representatives.                  In     any   event,      the     Board     has

previously concluded that Better Alternative's bid was late.

Thus,    none of the officials of the Department had authority,

discretionary or             otherwise,         to accept         Better Alternative's

bid     for   the     Department,         and     no     action      by   the   procurement

officials       involved        could negate           the    rule    that a    late hand-

carried bid must be                  rejected.         See MMM,      §2620. 9E.     In this

connection,         the Board notes that nine firms submitted timely

bids under the requirements and circumstances presented by the

IFB.     See the Department's Report of Facts.                            The Board is of

the view that the              rule regarding           late bids must be strictly

enforced in order to be fair to other bidders who submitted

their    bids    timely and            to maintain public             confidence        in the

integrity of the competitive bidding                          system.       See D.C.       Code

1981, §1-1181.1(b)             (1986 Supp.).

        The protest is denied.
