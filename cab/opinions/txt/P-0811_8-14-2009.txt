                                             OPINION
                                          Filing ID 26603720

        On June 18, 2009, AAA Termite Pest Control (“AAA”) protested the cancellation of IFB
DCAM-2009-B-0004, for pest control services. The District filed a motion to dismiss the protest
as moot after the contracting officer found that the specifications were ambiguous and failed to
state the needs of the District. After review of the protest and the motion to dismiss, the Board
denies the protest.

                                                FACTS

       On January 16, 2009, the Office of Contracting and Procurement (“OCP”) on behalf of
the Office of Property Management (recently renamed the Department of Real Estate Services),
issued IFB No. DCAM-2009-B-0004, in the small business set-aside market. (Motion to
Dismiss, Ex. 1). The IFB described a firm fixed price contract for a comprehensive pest control
program for District Government facilities. (Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 1). Bids were submitted on
February 24, 2009. (Motion to Dismiss, Exs. 1, 6). The protester’s bid was the lowest of five
bids. (Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 6). The IFB was the subject of a prior protest, P-0798, which was
dismissed on April 10, 2009. The present protest was filed on June 18, 2009.

                                            DISCUSSION

        In its July 8, 2009 motion to dismiss, the District asserts that the Board should dismiss the
protest because the District cancelled the solicitation after determining that the specifications
were ambiguous and that the specifications failed to set forth the needs of the District. In support
of that determination, the contracting officer submitted a declaration dated July 7, 2009 (Motion
to Dismiss, Ex. 11), setting forth the District’s reasons for cancelling the solicitation. There is no
dispute that the District has properly supported the cancellation which resolves the basis for the
protest. AAA has not objected to the motion. Accordingly, we deny the protest as the motion is
conceded.
