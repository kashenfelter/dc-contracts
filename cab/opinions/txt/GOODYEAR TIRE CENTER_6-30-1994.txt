                               OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS


                 On April 15, 1994, Goodyear Tire Center (hereinafter "Goodyear" or "protestor")! filed
         a protest against award of a contract for fleet tire service to Truck Tire, Inc. (hereinafter "Truck
         Tire") under IFB No. OMS-3250-AA-CC. Protestor alleged that at the January 24, 1994, bid
         opening, Truck Tire's bid was nonresponsive to the solicitation because: (1) the bid did not
         contain the required attachments, specifically Addendum 1 and Addendum 2; (2) the bid showed
         "no bid" for Items 1, 6, 19, 20 and 21 through 25 of the schedule; and (3) the bidder failed to
         sign the "First Source Employment Agreement" and the "Assurance of CompHance." With
         respect to Truck Tire's "no bid," protestor challenged an "assumption" made that "no bid" on
         an item means "zero."

                 Protestor also alleged that after receipt of notice of award on April 2, 1994, it reviewed
         the total bid package and discovered that with reference to the bid tabulations, the procuring
         agency did not evaluate Addendum 1 and Addendum 2. Finally, protestor alleged that it was
         improperly denied a five percent preference as a minority bidder.

                 On May 23, 1994, the District of Columbia (hereinafter "District") filed a pleading
         entitled "Motion of the District of Columbia to Dismiss Part of the Protest and Agency Report
         Concerning the Remainder of the Protest," with accompanying exhibits. 2 The District argued


            'Goodyear Tire Center is owned and operated by Henderson Tire & Auto, Inc. (Protest, Letterhead).

             2Hereinafter, the pleading shall be referred to as "MOlAR, Ex(s). _." The exhibits include supplemental
         exhibits submitted by the District at the Board's request on May 27, 1994.
                                                                                                                  [5884]



                                                        - 2 -            Goodyear Tire Cellfer, CAB No. P-407



that with respect to the allegations concerning the responsiveness of Truck Tire's bid and denial
of the minority preference, the allegations are untimely and should be dismissed because
protestor knew, or should have known, at the time of bid opening the bases for its challenges
to responsiveness. Further, the District asserts that because Goodyear would not be in line for
award if the protest were sustained, it lacks standing to bring the protest. Finally, the District
states that while it is true that the original bid tabulation was in error, the error was de minimus
and had no effect on the relative standing of the bidders. The District asked the Board to deny
this ground of the protest.

       After review of all of the evidence, we agree with the District that the allegations
concerning the responsiveness of Truck Tire's bid are untimely and should be dismissed.
Additionally, we believe that Goodyear's allegation concerning the erroneous bid tabulation is
untimely and should be dismissed. 3

        The facts show that on January 24, 1994, the date scheduled for bid opening,4 four bids
were received and opened. Protestor was present at the bid opening; and at that time, according
to the protest letter, the bids were read. Protestor learned the following:

          H & H - 'no aggregate totals.'


          TRUCK TIRE, INC[.] - 'no attachments. [N]o bids on item numbers I, 6, 19,20,
                               and 21 through 25, with the aggregate total being $192,325.00'

          FRIENDS TIRE AND FLEET SERVICE - 'no bids on item numbers 12, 18, and
                                       27, with no total.'


          HENDERSON TIRE & AUTO, INC. - 'no charge on item numbers 1, 12, 18,
                                     and 27, with total of $230,725.00.'

(Protest, page 1). 5

          Section 908(b) of the Procurement Practices Act of 1985, D.C. Code § l-1189.8(b),
states:




    ' Consequently, we need not reach the issues of protestor's standing, or the challenge to the alleged failure to
give protestor a five percent minority preference, or the issue of Truck Tire's failure to execute certain attachments.

                                                                 -3-             Goodyear Tire Center, CAB No. P-407

                 For a protest pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the aggrieved person shall
                 file a protest with the Board within 10 workin!: days after the aggrieved person
                 knew or should have known of the facts and circumstances upon which the protest
                 is based. (emphasis added).

         See Rule 301.1 of the Board's Rules of Practice. 6 We have held on innumerable occasions that
         the IO-working-day filing requirement is jurisdictional and cannot be waived. See, e.g.,
         Continental Flooring Co., CAB No. P-402, April 11 , 1994, 7 P.D. 5803; Interior Systems, Inc.,
         CAB No. P-398, January 10, 1994, 6 P.D. 5544; Bio-Analytical Laboratories, Inc., CAB No.
         P-373, June 17,1993,6 P.D. 5215; Macton Construction, Inc., CAB No. P-203, December 19,
         1991, 39 DCR 4368 (1992). Nonetheless, we have recently held that where there is a dispute
         over timeliness, we will generally resolve it in the protestor's favor if there is at least a
         reasonable degree of evidence to support the protestor's version of the facts. Potomac Capital
         Investment Corporation, CAB No. P-383, January 4, 1994, 6 P.D. 5515 (and cases cited
         therein). See Howard Management Group, B-221889, July 3, 1986, 86-2 CPD 128; Conine
         Rentals, Inc. , B-194143, June 26, 1979,79-1 CPD 1456.

                Here, Goodyear argued that it did not know definitively at the time of bid opening that
         Truck Tire's bid was nonresponsive or assume that the award would be made to a nonresponsive
         bidder. (protestor's Response, page 3).7 Protestor claims that at the time of bid opening, the
         only information it had was that Truck Tire did not submit the addenda, did not have all of the
         attachments and did not bid on certain items. (Id., pages 3-4).

                 In our opinion, the information that protestor states that it had on January 24, 1994,
         obviously forms the bases for the protest filed on April 15, 1994. In fact, it is clear from the
         statements made in the protest itself that Goodyear knew or should have known of the bases for
         its protest at the time of bid opening. The protest was filed almost three months later, far
         beyond the jurisdictional 10-working-day filing requirement. As a result, the allegations are
         untimely.

                With respect to the errors in bid tabulation, the evidence shows that protestor knew or
         should have known of the errors at the time of bid opening. According to protestor, its own bid
         was announced as $230,725.00. Its bid, however, was $232,705.00. 8 At that point, Goodyear
         knew or should have known that at least one error in bid tabulation had occurred. Again,
         however, protestor waited almost three months to challenge any error. See Mounts Engineering,
         B-218102, February 21, 1985,85-1 CPD 1223.
