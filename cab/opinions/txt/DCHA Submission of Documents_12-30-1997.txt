     For the Protester: Ardelia Davis, Esq. For the District of Columbia Housing Authority:
Awo Sarpong, Esq., Acting Deputy General Counsel.

       Opinion by Administrative Judge Jonathan D. Zischkau, with Chief Administrative Judge
Lorilyn E. Simkins and Administrative Judge Phyllis W. Jackson, concurring.

                                            OPINION
        The protester, First Impression Construction Co., challenges the District of Columbia
Housing Authority's (DCHA) award of a contract M.C. Services, Inc., and the failure of DCHA
to act on another unsolicited proposal. DCHA moved to dismiss the protest on the ground that
the Board lacks jurisdiction over protests of DCHA procurements. We conclude that through the
Procurement Reform Amendment Act of 1996, the Council intended to and effected the uniform
application of the Procurement Practices Act to all District agencies, dep~tments, and
instrumentalities except for certain agencies expressly exempted by tl:te Procurement Reform
Amendment Act. On the merits, the protest cannot be sustained. As the record demonstrates,
there was neither an official solicitation nor an award with regard to First Impression's unsolicited
proposal and therefore we dismiss that protest ground. We deny the protest with regard to the
award of Purchase Order No. 11476 because the record shows that the protester's bid was not the
lowest responsive bid.

                                         BACKGROUND
       On June 18, 1997, DCHA issued Invitation No. 11476 for the cleaning of exterior brick
and the repair and replacement of gutters at the Syphax Gardens housing complex. (DCHA
response, dated Nov. 21, 1997, Bid Tabulation Sheet). Through contacts with a DCHA project
manager and unsolicited proposals during the period March through May 1997, First Impression
had developed a scope of work that was reflected at least partially in Invitation No. 11476. 1 For
example, in an unsolicited proposal dated May 15, 1997, First Impression set forth a statement
of work needed for repairing and replacing downspouts and gutters at Syphax Gardens. The
various copies of the May 15 proposal in the protest record do not include a price quote. (See
Agency Report, Ex. 5, at 3; Protester's response, dated Nov. 21, 1997, Attachment A, at 1). The



1 10 its November 21, 1997 response, First Impression alleges that its March 12, 1997 unsolicited
proposal ("Ref. No. 1091 "), see Agency RePort, Ex. 5, at 5-7, provided some of the specifications
which were used in Invitation No. 11476. The point is legally irrelevant.

                                                                  •
                                                         First Impression Constr. Co., CAB No. P-513

May 15 proposal 'as contained in the record does not indicate that First Impression included
cleaning of exterior brick at Syphax Gardens. DCHA did not award a contract to First Impression
in response to the May 15 proposal. Invitation No. 11476, as issued by DCHA on June 18
included not only the gutter and downspout work but also cleaning of exterior brick surfaces of
the Syphax Garden buildings. Invitation No. 11476 set forth a bid opening date of June 24, 1997.
DCHA's bid tabulation sheet indicates that three entities picked up a copy of the Invitation. The
awardee, M.C. Services, Inc., submitted a bid in the amount of $96,770 on June 19, Southern
Renovation submitted a bid of $107,020 on June 20, and EDWILL Management Inc. submitted
a bid of $109,270 on June 24. (protester's response, dated Nov. 21, -1997, Attachment C, at 2-5).
It appears from the record that First Impression did not learn of the issuance of Invitation No.
11476 until late July 1997, from the same DCHA' project manager. with whom First Impression
had dealt regarding the May 15 unsolicited proposal. (Id., Attachment A, at 4-6). On July 28,
First Impressions submitted a bid of $122,706. (Id., Attachment A, at 2-3). On August 13,
1997, Ms. Lisa Blacknall, DCHA contracting officer, executed Purchase Orde~ No. 11476, to
M.C. Services for the work set forth in Invitation No. 11476.

        First Impression also challenges the failure of DCHA to act upon its unsolicited proposal
entitled "Contract for Enclosing Fifty-Eight Door Openings Approximately 36 x 80" under "Ref.
No. 1092." The DCHA contracting officer states that DCHA never requested proposals for the
work proposed., by First Impression and DCHA. never issued a contract ~or such work.
(Declaration of Lisa Blacknall, filed Nov. 21, 1997).

                                        DISCUSSION

        In a submission dated October 31, 1997, and supplemented on November 12, 1997,
DCHA has moved to dismiss the captioned protest on the grounds that DCHA is specifically
exempted from the Procurement Practices Act by virtue of D.C. Code § 5-129'(b), codifying
section 11 of the District of Columbia Housing Authority Act of 1994, D.C. Law 10-243, which
was enacted on March 21, 1995. Section 5-129(b) provides:

          The Board [of Commissioners] shall develop standards for purchases of , and
       contract for, supplies and services consistent with applicable laws. Emergency
       purchases shall be allowed subject to the approval of persons delegated to do so by
       the Board, and a full written determination and finding of the circumstances of
       such emergency purchase, along with the purchase, documents, shall be
       immediately open to public inspection. The Authority shall be exempt from
       Chapter llA of Title 1.                                                        '

By virtue of the consent order entered in Pearson, et al. v. Kelly, 92-CA-14030, the Board of
Commissioners never came into existence. Instead, a receiver was appointed who assumed all
powers of the former Department of Public and Assisted Housing (DPAH) and its statutory
successor, DCHA. See Padula Constr. Co., CAB No. D-997, Sept. 17, 1996, ~44 D.C. Reg.
6497, 6500. DCHA correctly states that based on section 5-129(b) we had held that we lacked
jurisdiction over protests of DCHA procurements. See, e.g., MTI Construction Co., CAB No.
P-445, Jan. 24, 1996, 44 D.C. Reg. 6411, Wells Fargo Guard Services, CAB No. 'P-442, Jan.

24, 1996,44 D.C. 'Reg. 6408. Those decisions, however, were based on an analysis of section
5-129(b) and the Procurement Practices Act prior to enactment of the Procurement Reform>
Amendment Act of 1996, D.C. Laiv 11-259, effective Apr. 12, 1997. The Procurement Reform
Amendment Act and the legislative history clearly show that the Council of the Pistrict of
Columbia intended to make the Procurement Practices Act apply to nearly all departments,
agencies, and instrumentalities of the -District government.
                                                                           ,
       Prior to the Procurement Reform Amendment Act, the 1992 amended version of D.C.
Code § 1-1181.4 (derived from section 104 of the Procurement Practices Act of 1985, D.C. Law
6-85) provided in relevant part:                                                '
                                                \

      (a) Nothing in this chapter shall abrogate the authority of a separate branch of
      government or an independent agency, as defined in subchapter I of Chapter 15 of
      this title, to enter into contracts or to issue rules and regulations for the awarding
      of contracts pursuant to existing law.

      (b) Any existing provisions of District law regarding the conformity to District
      procurement law of rules and regulations issued or promulgated by independent
      agencies shall remain in effect.

      (c) This chapter shall apply to all agencies and employees of the District
      government which are subordinate to the Mayor.



       (e) Any branch or agency of government exempted from the provisions of this
       chapter by subsection (a) of this section may formally agree to be bound by any
       provisions of this chapter, or by the final rules and procedures adopted pursuant
       to this chapter.                    '

Thus, the PPA (codified in Chapter 11A of the D.C. Code) prior to the Procurement Reform
Amendment Act of 1996 covered only departments, agencies, and employees subordinate to the
Mayor, and those independent agencies which elected by formal agreement to be bound by
provisions of the PPA. The Procurement Reform Amendment Act substantially expanded the
applicability of the PPA. As amended, D.C. Code § 1-1181.4(a) (Supp. 1997) now provides:

             Except as provided in § 1-1183.20, this chapter shall apply to all
      departments, agencies, instrumentalities, and employees of the District
      government, including agencies which are subordinate to the Mayor, independent
      agencies, boards, and commissions, but excluding the Council of the District of
      Columbia, District of Columbia courts, and the District of Columbia Financial
      Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority.

D.C. Law 11-259, § 101(b), 44 D.C. Reg. 1423, 1425 (emphasis added). DCHA is statutorily
defined as an instrumentality of the District government. D.C. Code § 5-122(a) (Supp. 1997).
                          •                    -4-
                                                                    •
                                                          First Impression Constr. Co., CAB No. P-513

Section 1-1183.20 expressly exeDlPts certain agencies, departments, and instrumeritalities from
all or portions of the PPA. DCHA is 'not included in the list of .exempt entities in section 1-
1183.20.

        The legislative history for the Procurement Reform Amendment Act demonstrates that
section 1-1181.4(a)'s nearly universal coverage of District procurement was one of the principal
features of the Procurement Reform Amendment Act. The Council's purpose was to achieve
uniform procurement law throughout the District government. The Council intended to cover all
departments, agencies, and instrumentalities except for those expressly exempted in the
Procurement Reform Amendment Act. Because the Council intended the language of section 1-
1181.4(a) to be quite broad, and the Council intended to make only narrow exceptions to the Act's
coverage, we believe our statutory construction is proper here. Accordingly, we exercise
jurisdiction over the protest pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1189.3 (Supp. 1997).

         On the merits, we see no basis for sustaining First Impression's protest with regard to the
solicitation and award of Purchase Order No. 11476 to M.C. Services. It is not clear from the
record why First Impressiop was not advised of Invitation No. 11476 until over one month after
its issuance. Even accepting that First Impression assisted DCHA in developing its statement of
work through its submission of unsolicited proposals and discussions with DCHA's project
manager, it appears that DCHA did consider First Impression's July 28 bid. It did not receive the
award because its bid was the highest of the four bids received. First Impression's contention that
the low bid was not responsive because it was too low is not supported by the record. Moreover,
First Impression has not shown that the second and third low bidders were nonresponsible or that
their bids were not responsive to the solicitation.

       First Impression's challenge of DCHA's failure to act on its unsolicited proposal (Ref. No.
1092) is not a valid ground for protest and must be dismissed.

       Accordingly, First Impression '·s protest is denied in part and dismissed in part.
