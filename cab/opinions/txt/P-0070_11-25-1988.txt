                                                   CAB No. P-70

     For the protester:  Andrew Schlosser, President.   For the
Government: Warren J. Nash, Assistant Corporation counsel, D.C.
     Opinion by Administrative Judge Sharpe 1 with Administrative
Judges Booker and Marlin concurring.


                        SUMMARY OF OPINION

     RESPONSIVENESS--FAILURE TO FURNISH IFB REQUESTED
INFORMATION.   Protest by second low bidder that the low bidder's
failure to furnish a pay item breakdown of its bid price by bid
opening as requested by the IFB renders the bid nonresponsive is
without legal merit since (1) the low bidder entered a total bid
price on the IFB Bid Form,   (2) the breakdown of the bid price by
pay items was not needed to properly evaluate the bid prices
submitted and (3) the failure to submit a pay item breakdown of
the bid price did not to any extent qualify the low bidder's
promise or commitment to complete the entire construction project
as specified at the quoted bid price.

     RESPONSIVENESS--MATERIALITY OF IFB PROVISION--PRICE
EVALUATION.    In order for a bid to be responsive, the PPA
provides that it must conform in all "material" respects to the
IFB.   At the time the procurement at issue was being solicited,
the term "material" meant that which affected the price,
quantity, quality or delivery of the terms offered.         Thus,
inasmuch as the IFB by its own terms contemplated an evaluation
of bids based on a single firm, fixed price covering all of the
specified work without an evaluation of the pay item amounts and
the award of one contract, it was the bid price provision of the
Bid Form which called for the bidders to submit a total bid price
that reflected the material term of the IFB and not the pay item
schedule which only called for the entry of the same bid price
entered on the Bid Form preceded by a pay item breakdown showing
how the bid price was calculated.   Further, because the pay item
amounts would only be used for contract payments and adjustments,
the IFB provision requesting a breakdown of the total bid price

       IJudge Sharpe's participation in this case is pursuant to
  the authority contained in the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of
  1985, D.C. Code, sec. 1-1189.2(c) (2) (1987 Replacement).
                                            - 2 -

by pay items concerned matters relating to contract administra-
tion and not bid responsiveness.
     RESPONSIVENESS--MATERIALITY OF IFB PROVISION--AGENCY CHARAC-
TERIZATION.   Protester's contention that certain IFB provisions
and the District's long standing policy that all IFB requested
items are to be submitted by bid opening established that a
failure to submit the IFB requested pay item breakdown of the bid
price rendered the bid nonresponsive lacks substance because
these considerations, even if proven, could not override the PPA
requirement that the rationale underlying the responsiveness
characterization must in all cases est.ablish a material term to
the IFB.
                             OPINION
     This case 2 concerns IFB No. 87-0152-AA-2-0-CC ("IFB") which

sought bids for the construction project--occoquan Complex Code

Compliance,       Occoquan,    Virginia.            The protester,       W.M.    Schlosser
Co., Inc.    ("Schlosser"), protests the Department of Public Works'
determination that the bid of the apparent low bidder, Len Parker
Mechanical        and   General     Contractors,        Inc.    (IILen    Parker"),     was
responsive to the IFB.             See Schlosser's letter to the Board dated
October     16,     1987,    and    filed      on    October    20,      1987    ("protest

letter") .          Schlosser       is   the        apparent,    second-low        bidder.
Schlosser alleges that Len Parker's bid is nonresponsive because

it did    not      include    the   Itemized        Construction Cost           form   ("ICC




       2This case originated during a period of time when the
  District of Columbia Contract Appeals Board was functioning
  pursuant to Commissioner's Organization Order No.9, D.C. Code,
  Supplement V (1978), as amended by Mayor's Order No. 82-224, 30
  DCR 497 (January 28, 1983) and Mayor's Order 86-65, 33 DCR 3006
  (May 16, 1986).    Pursuant to sec. 1-1189.1, a new independent
  agency denominated as the Contract Appeals Board was created.
  This new Board became operational on August 1, 1988, and
  succeeded to jurisdiction of all protest cases pending before the
  previously established Board.

form") contained in the IFB.3        Schlosser requests that we declare
Len Parker's bid to be nonresponsive and order the award of the

contract to it as the lowest responsive bidder.

     The ICC form lists 19 pay items (work categories comprising

the construction project)     with a       corresponding column for the
bidders to state a separate cost for each pay item.                  At the end
of the ICC form is a line for the bidders to state their total
itemized   construction   cost.      Even       though   Len    Parker    did   not
submit the ICC form or the information requested by the form with

its bid or by bid opening, it did include in its bid a bid price
set forth in the provision provided for this purpose on the IFB

document, Bid form (Construction Contract).              See unmarked exhibit
attached to the Agency Report of the District of Columbia dated
December 17, 1987, and filed December 21, 1987 ("Agency Report"),
document Q2-1.

     In support of its allegation, Schlosser contends that "[i]t

has long been a policy of the [District] that all documents in
the Bid Form and Proposal must be submitted to render the bid

responsive to the Invitation."        See protest letter at 1.            It also

contends that several provisions in the IFB made it mandatory
that the   ICC   form be submitted with 'the             IFB or prior to bid
opening.
     contrarily,   the    District    argues      that    the   failure    of   Len
Parker to submit the ICC form with its bid or before bid opening


       3The ICC form is document 08-1 of the IFB (for the IFB,
  see unmarked exhibit attached to the Agency Report).
                                             -   4 -

constitutes a minor informality (and therefore can be waived as
such) because the lack of information requested by the form meant
no more than the District could not compare the bid submitted on

a pay item-by-pay item basis.                See Agency Report at 1.            In this

connection,      the   District       notes      that    bids    could,    however,     be

compared on the basis of the total                      contract prices that were

quoted. Id.
        The   D.C.   Procurement          Practice     Act    of 1985     ("PPA"),    D.C.
Code,    sec.   1-1183.3(e)    (1987 Replacement)              states that contracts
solicited by competitive sealed bidding,                       as is the case here,

" s hall be awarded .     . . to the responsive and responsible bidder
whose bid will be most advantageous to the District, considering

price and other factors."             (Emphasis added.)           As the parties are
apparently well aware,         II   [aJ    bid that is not responsive is not
curable after the bid is opened. II                     Am.   Combustion v. Minority
Business opportunity,         441 A.2d 660,             671   (D.C.   1982)   (citations
omitted) .      The criterion for determining a bid's responsiveness

is stated in the PPA,         sec. 1-1181.7(41), which defines " r espon-

siveness" in the context of a                 "responsive bidder".            section 1-

1181.7(41) reads:
        II 'Responsive bidder'  means a person who has submitted a
        bid which conforms in all material respects to the
        invitation for bids. II
Emphasis added.)4        This provision makes clear that in deciding a
protest alleging that a certain bid omission renders the bid

  one that conforms to the material elements of an invitation to
  bid").

nonresponsive,      a   determination must be made as to whether the
solicitation provision            at    the    bottom of          the controversy is a
material term of the solicitation.                       Although the PPA does not go
so far as to define "material",                    the procurement regulations in

force at the time the IFB was issued, in effect, defined the word

to mean that which affects price, quantity, quality or delivery
of the     items offered. 5            See Materiel Management Manual,                secs.
2620.13.B.2.e       and    2620.14.A           (for       the   effectivity     of    these
sections,    see    Notice of Emergency and Proposed Rulemaking,                         33
DCR 2698     and   2700    (May    2,    1986).           Given this definition,        the
question    presented      by     this    protest          is   whether   the   ICC    form
consti tutes a material term of the IFB.                          For the reasons that
follow, we conclude that it does not.

     The    IFB    document,      BID FORM          (CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT)           ("Bid
Form")     among   other    things,           includes      the    following    provision

(hereinafter referred to as the "bid price provision") :


     5Compare with the D.C. Procurement Regulations which became
effective February 26, 1988, 35 DCR sec. 1599.1, 27 DCMR sec.
1599.1 (July, 1988):

     "Minor informality or irregularity - some immaterial defect
     in a bid or variation of a bid from the exact requirements
     of the IFB that can be corrected or waived without being
     prejudicial to other bidders.   The defect or variation is
     immaterial when the effect on price, quantity, quality, or
     delivery is negligible when contrasted with the total cost
     or scope of the requirement."
Also compare with minor informalities or irregularities in bids,
Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR sec. 14.405 (1987):
     "The defect or variation is immaterial when the effect on
     price, quantity, quality, or delivery is negligible when
     contrasted with the total cost or scope of the supplies or
     services being acquired."

     "TO: CONTRACTING OFFICER, GOVERNMENT OF THE DISTRICT OF
     COLUMBIA
     "In compliance with above invitation, the undersigned
     proposes to furnish all plant, labor and materials and
     perform required work per provisions as set forth in
     the Standard Contract Provisions, as amended, specific-
     ations, addenda, drawings, for the consideration of:
     $            "
See unmarked exhibit attached to the Agency Report.                       The language

of   this     provision      evidences     that    'the   IFB      contemplated     an
evaluation of bids based on a single firm,                  fixed price covering

all of the specified work without an Ewaluation of the separate
pay items and the award of one contract.                     In this regard,       the
record reveals that Len Parker offered with its bid a firm, fixed

price to perform the construction services that were specified
in the      IFB.      This was done by Len Parker's             insertion of the
figure "2,466,000" on the blank line in the bid price provision.
All that the ICC form called for was the entry                          (on the line,

"Itemized Construction Cost                       TOTAL")     of    the    exact   same
contract price entered in the bid price provision preceded by a
breakdown by the listed pay items of how this price was derived.
     As mentioned earlier, the District: points out that although

the lack of a breakdown of Len Parker's bid price meant that the
District could not compare the pay item prices composing its bid

with the pay item prices of any other bid,                    the District could

compare the total contract price bid by Len Parker with the total
contract      price    bid   by   the    other    bidders.         We    agree.     The
significance of this is that where,                as here,        an evaluation of
bids based on total prices is contemplat:ed, all that is necessary
                                                -    7 -

is that the District receives from the bidders a total contract

price which is firm and fixed.                      Moreover, we find that the bid

price provision language            ("in compliance with above invitation,

the    undersigned      proposes          to        furnish       all   plant,     labor      and

materials and perform required work .                        .     for consideration of")
is clear in that when a              bidder inserted an amount in the bid

price provision and affixed its signa'ture to the Bid Form, the

bidder was committing itself to complete the contract work for

the    amount   inserted,      if   it were determined to be the                         lowest,

responsive and responsible bidder. 6                       Having done this, Len Parker

was without question bound to complete the entire construction

project at the price stated in the bid price provision when the

District awarded it the contract.

       While the District may have wanted the bidders to provide

with    their   bids    a    price breakdown               by    pay    items    for    contract

payment,    contract        adjustment         or     other      contract       administration

purposes, the plain and simple matter is that the request in this

regard was not a material requirement of the IFB.                                  This is so

because the price breakdown amounts were not needed to properly

evaluate the bids, and the failure to provide them would not in

and of itself qualify a bidder's promise or commitment to perform

the    specified      work    at    the        price       inserted     in   the       bid   price

provision.       In    other words,            the     pay       item   amounts    related      to


        6S ee sec. 1-1183.3{e) which provides that in competitive
  sealed bidding procurements, "[tJhe contract shall be awarded
       . to the responsive and responsible bidder whose bid will be
  most advantageous to the District, considering price and other
  factors."
                                                 -   8 -

matters concerning contract administra'tion and not bid respon-

siveness.
       with respect to Schlosser's allegation that "[i]t has long

been a policy of the [District]                        that all documents in the Bid

Form and proposal must be submitted to render the bid responsive
       .", we first note that the allegation has been made without
any    evidence      to    support      it,      and    the   District      challenges     its
accuracy      (see Agency Report at unnumbered page 4).                           Second, we
note that if such a policy did exist,                         it would be inconsistent
with    the   PPA.        As we pointed out                earlier,   the    PPA   (sec.    1-

1181.7 (41))      articulates         the     criterion       for   determining     a   bid's
responsiveness.           Thus, we think it obvious that a responsiveness
determination cannot turn on a policy which is inconsistent with
the criterion enunciated in sec. 1-1181.7(41).
       Lastly, Schlosser argues that certain provisions of the IFB

make the omission of the ICC form a material deficiency.                                These
provisions       are      the   Title      Page--Bid Forms          and   Proposals     which

states     all    forms         are   to    be       submitted;       Standard      Contract

Provisions, Article 10 Price Schedule Interpretation which states
"Price Schedule is prepared for the comparison of bids .                                   . " ,.
and Instructions to Bidders, Article 18 Award or Rejection which
states     proposals        will      be    considered        irregular      if    they    are

submitted on a form not furnished by the District or an altered
or partially detached form.                   We think we can best address this

argument by taking it one step further.                         Even assuming that the

IFB provisions Schlosser references went so far as to explicitly
                                          -   9 -

state that the ICC form was a material requirement of the IFB and
a bidder's failure to submit the document in a completed form or

to provide the information called for by bid opening would result

in    a    nonresponsive       determination,       the   instruction   or   warning

would not have been of any consequence.                   It would not have been

of any consequence for the reason that "merely stating that a
requirement is a responsive matter will not suffice to make it
so.        In   all   cases,    the   rationale      underlying   the   responsive
characterization must establish a material term to the invitation
for bid."        Forrester Constructors, Inc., 1 P.D. 74, 83 n.6.

(D.C. CAB 1987).
          In sum, we conclude that the bid price provision by calling

for the bidders to quote a single firm,                   fixed price and thereby

commit themselves to complete all of the specified construction
work at the quoted price, insofar as is relevant here, reflects
the material term of the IFB and not the ICC form which only

requested that the bidders reiterate their bid price and provide
a pay item breakdown of it.            It therefore follows that since Len

Parker's bid was not at variance with the bid price provision, it

would have been improper for the District to have determined Len
Parker's        bid to be      nonresponsive merely because it           failed   to
submit by the time of bid opening the information requested by
the ICC form.         Because the pay item amounts were not relevant to
bid evaluation and their omission did not qualify to any extent

Len Parker's bid price as stated in the bid price provision, the
omission of the pay item amounts could be properly waived by the
                               - 10 -

District as a minor informality.   Accordingly, there is no legal

merit to Schlosser's protest that Len Parker's bid was nonrespon-

sive for the reason alleged.

     THE PROTEST IS DENIED.
