                                           ISSUE PRESENTED

                 The central issue in this protest is whether the District properly cancelled a
         solicitation.

                                             BACKGROUND

               On February 4, 1988, the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) issued
         IFB No. 8226-AA·25·0·8-AC (IFB) in the sheltered market to invite competitive bids for
         the supply· of tire chains- in -snow emergencies for vehicles of the Metropolitan Police
         Department (MPD). See Agency Report filed on June 8, 1988 at 2 and em. A thereto.

               DAS issued the IFB to eight potential bidders; the bids were scheduled to be
         opened on March 10, 1988. Id. at 2 and em. B.

                However, by written memorandum from MPD to DAS, dated March 4, 1988, MPD
         requested the solicitation be cancelled as "no longer a requirement." Id. at 2 and em. C.



           1IIbis case originated during the period when the District of Columbia Contract Ap-
         peals Board was functioning pursuant to Commissioner's Order No.9, D.C. Code, Sup-
        plement V (1987), as amended by Mayor's Order 86-65, 33 DCR 3006 (May 16, 1986).
        Pursuant to the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985 (PPA), D.C. Code, § 1·1189.1
         (1987), a new independent agency denominated as the Contract Appeals Board was
        created. This new Board became operational on August 1, 1988, and succeeded to the
        Jurisdiction of all cases pending before the previously established Board.

            On March 9, 1988, one day before bids were to be opened, DAS received the MPD
     memorandum and Immediately telephoned all eiaht ftrms on the bid list to Inform them
     that the solicitation was cancelled. All the potential bidders were contacted, except for
     Battery Place, the protester, which did not "answer the telephone" despite several at·
     tempts. Ida at 2, 3 and exh. D. Battery Place submitted a bid to DAS on March 10, the
     only bid received In response to the IFB. DAS retained the bid unopened. lsi: at J.

           On March 9, followina the telephone        calls to potential bidders, DAS forwarded
    MPD's cancellation request to the Director        of DAS throuah the Procurement Review
    Committee (PRC). On March 14, 1988, the           PRC advised DAS that additional detailed
    Justlncatlon for the cancellation was needed.     Id. at J and exb. E.

           By memorandum dated March 25, 1988, MPD advised DAS that cancellation of
    the IFB was required because MPD recently had located sumcient tire chains for its
    vehicles. IsL at J and exh. F. The PRC found this justification to be adequate and,
    accordingly, the DAS director on April 4, 1988 approved the cancellation of the IFB
    pursuant to legal requirements and "in the best interest of the District ...." Id. at J
    and exh. G.

           On April 25, 1988, DAS notified Battery Place and all of the potential bidders
    that the IFB had been cancelled on April 4, 1988 and returned Battery Place's bid un·
    opened. Id. at J and exh. H. Battery Place filed this protest with tbe Board on March
    29, 1988.

            Battery Place's protest, in essence, alleges that DAS' cancellation of the IFB was
    derective because originally it was not in writing but by telephone, and tbe necessary
    internal paperwork was not formally completed in advance of the bid opening date. See
    protest letter received by the Board on March 29, 1988.

           Although not specifically expressed in the protest letter, Battery Place undoubtedly
    believes that the District government had a legal obligation to cancel tbe IFB sumciently
    early so that Battery Place would have had notice not to prepare and submit a bid.

          The District's response asserts that its actions in cancelling tbe IFB were proper
    and in accordance with District law and regulations.


                                            OPINION

            The District of Columbia Procurement Practices Act of 1985, D.C. Code, § 1·
    1183.7 (1987) (hereinafter PPA) authorizes the cancellation of Invitations for bids "only
    if it is determined in writing by the Director [of DAS] that the action is taken in the
    best interest of the District government"

                                                        -3-
                  Corresponding District regulations also autborize cancellation or an IFB. If the
          cancellation occurs before bid opening, which was intended here, the action must be "in
          writing" and after the DAS Director determines that tbe action "is in the best interest of
          the District." 27 DCMR § 1518.1 (July 1988). After cancellation, bids must be returued
          to bidders unopened, Id. § 1518.3, and all prospective bidders must be notified. Id. I
          1518.4.

                 If the cancellation occurs after bid opening, or the time for bid opening, which
          formally occurred here, the standard remains that there must be a detennination by the
          Director of DAS that "the action taken is in the best interest of the District." 27 DCMR
          § 1530.1.11 Among the justifications provided for such a cancellation is if the "supplies
          ... being contracted for are no longer required." Id. § 1530.4(c).

                 An additional regulation relevant to this case states "Every effort shall be made to
          anticipate changes in a requirement before the date of opening and to notify all prospec-
          tive bidders of any resulting modification or cancellation." Id. § 1530.2.

                 There can be no doubt that the District's actions were in compliance with the
          legal obligations outlined above.

                The April 4, 1988 memorandum, and attached Detennination and Findings (exh.
          G) openly disclosed that the acquisition of tire chains sought to equip police vehicles for
          snow conditions became unnecessary when an adequate supply was discovered in storage.

                 A prospective bidder might well complain justifiedly tbat better inventory control     f
         would have aborted the entire solicitation but a mistake or inefficiency does not amount       \
                                                                                                        ;


         to legal culpability. Neither the District goverument nor any large entity operates Daw-
         lessly. Furthermore, DAS must be credited with good faith efforts to prevent the sub-
         mission of unwanted bids, as indicated by the telephone calls to each prospective bidder
         on March 9, as well as ensuring that legally sufficient cancellation documents were
         ultimately developed.

                As we have stated, under District law and regulations bid solicitations may be
         cancelled whenever the District detennines it is in the best interest or the goverument.
         This is a judgment call, a decision within the discretion of the District, but a decision
         that may be challenged, as Battery Place has.




           YBest interest of the District government is defined as .•• "courses or action that
         result in the most favorable position within the market for goods and services. • .•"
         PPA, § 1-1181.7(4).

                           To overturn the District's decision, a protester must prove, by a preponderance of
                    the evidence, that there has been an abuse of discretion. Generally speaking, the
                    protester must be able to show fraud or bad faith, neither of which is in evidence in this
                    case.

                          This protest is DENIED.
