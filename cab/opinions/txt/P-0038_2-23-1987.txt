PROTEST OF:

          PERDOMO AND ASSOCIATES

          Under IFB No. 86-0077-AA-2-0-CC-U08(H-S)


                              MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

          The protester has failed to perfect a protest in that there

is no indication of what the protest is about.             Additionally,

the protester has failed to communicate with the Board within

the   last     two   years.    Accordingly,   the   Board considers this

matter as having been abandoned.
