                                      Filing ID 44476514

        AMI Risk Consultants, Inc. (“AMI” or “protester”) has filed a protest challenging the
District’s decision to award a contract to PRM Consulting (“PRM”) under solicitation number
DCRK-2011-R-0219. The protester challenges the award on the grounds that (a) the District
improperly disqualified AMI’s proposal due to AMI’s failure to obtain a District of Columbia
business license; and (b) PRM is not qualified to perform the work under the contract. The
District contends that (a) the protester was correctly determined by the Contracting Officer
(“CO”) to be nonresponsible, and (b) as a nonresponsible offeror, the protester lacks standing to
challenge the validity of the award.

        Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the CO did not violate procurement law,
regulation, or the terms of the solicitation in determining AMI to be nonresponsible. We deny
the protester’s challenge to the CO’s determination of nonresponsibility and, furthermore,
dismiss the remaining grounds for lack of standing.

                                       BACKGROUND

        On September 1, 2011, the District’s Office of Contracting and Procurement (“OCP”)
issued a small purchase Request for Proposals for Solicitation No. DCRK-2011-R-0219 (“RFP”)
on behalf of the Office of Risk Management (“ORM”). (See AR at Exs. 1, 2, 6.) The RFP
sought the “services of qualified actuary [sic] to develop and compile . . . data . . . and . . .
produce an actuarial study valuation of the [District’s] workers’ compensation and tort liability”
under a labor hour contract. (AR at Ex. 2, §§ B.1, B.2.) The RFP was amended twice prior to the
deadline for receipt of proposals on September 15, 2011. (AR at Ex. 1.) The amendments were
as follows: (i) on September 12, 2011, (Amendment No. 0001), potential offerors’ questions
were responded to and the responses were incorporated into the RFP; and (ii) on September 15,
                                                                             AMI Risk Consultants, Inc.
                                                                                      CAB No. P-0900

2011, (Amendment 0002), additional questions were responded to and amendments were made
to certain sections of the RFP. (AR at Ex. 3.)

Terms of the RFP

        The terms of the RFP set out ORM’s requirements for contract performance including the
expectation that “the period of performance for each contract term (base year and each action
year if exercised) will begin October 1st and end March 31st,” giving an awardee only 6 months
to complete all performance requirements of the anticipated contract. (AR at Ex. 2, § F.1.2.)
Deliverables under the contract included three drafts of reports, the first due by mid-November,
and bi-weekly status calls. (AR at Ex. 2, § F.3.) The District was required to award the contract
to “the responsible offeror whose offer is most advantageous to the District, based upon the
evaluation criteria specified.” (AR at Ex. 2a, § M.1.)

        The District reserved its right to “reject as non-responsive any bid that fails to conform in
any material respect to the RFP.” (AR at Ex. 2a, § L.2.4.) Furthermore, the RFP clearly stated
that bidders were “expected to read and understand fully all information and requirements
contained in the solicitation; failure to do so will be at bidders risk,” (AR at Ex. 2a, § L.5) and
“thoroughly familiarize themselves with the terms and conditions of this solicitation, acquainting
themselves with all available information regarding difficulties which may be encountered,” (AR
at Ex. 2a, § L.3).

        Under Section L.13 entitled “General Standards of Responsibility,” the RFP further
detailed that:

       The prospective contractor must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
       District its capability in all respects to perform fully the contract
       requirements; therefore, the prospective contractor must submit the
       documentation listed below, within five (5) days of the request by the
       District.

                                            ***

       § L.13.4        Evidence of compliance with the applicable District
                       licensing and tax laws and regulations.

                                            ***

       § L.13.8        If the prospective contractor fails to supply the information
                       requested, the CO shall make the determination of
                       responsibility or nonresponsibility based upon available
                       information. If the available information is insufficient to
                       make a determination of responsibility, the CO shall
                       determine the prospective contractor to be nonresponsible.

       (AR at Ex. 2a (emphasis added).)


                                                  2
                                                                             AMI Risk Consultants, Inc.
                                                                                      CAB No. P-0900



        The solicitation included additional requirements regarding an offeror’s license to do
business with the District of Columbia. The RFP stated that compliant proposals would include
in Section 4 of their respective proposals certain “Additional Documents,” including a “[c]opy of
valid business license [sic] if currently conducting business in the District of Columbia.” (AR at
Ex. 2a, § L.2.1.5(d); see also id. at § L.2.1.1.) Under Section L.12, entitled “Legal Status of
Bidder,” the RFP stated that offerors were required to provide in their bids the following:

       § L.12.2       A copy of each District of Columbia license, registration,
                      or certification that the bidder is required by law to obtain. .
                      . . If the bidder is a corporation or partnership and does not
                      provide a copy of its license, registration or certification to
                      transact business in the District of Columbia, the bid shall
                      certify its intent to obtain the necessary license, registration
                      or certification prior to contract award or its exemption
                      from such requirements.

       (AR at Ex. 2a.)

Evaluation of Proposals & Contract Award Decision

        The RFP closed on September 15, 2011. (AR at Ex. 1.) Two offerors, AMI and PRM
timely submitted proposals. (Id.) An evaluation panel “met to evaluate the technical proposals”
of both offerors and submitted its report “including consensus scores, as well as a listing of
strengths and weaknesses for each offeror.” (AR at Ex. 5.) On October 3, 2011, the CO
requested Best and Final Offers (“BAFOs”) from AMI and PRM. (AR at Exs. 1, 7.)

       On the same day, the Contract Specialist, Anthony Berry, sent a separate email to AMI
which stated:

               Due to operational needs, the District anticipates the subject
               solicitation no later than close of business, October 5, 2011. In
               order for your firm to be eligible for award, you are required to
               provide the necessary District license for business activities by
               12:00 noon, October 5, 2011.

               It is imperative that you contact Ms. Donise Peace, of the DC
               Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, to work
               responsively and expeditiously to resolve this licensure matter.

               (AR at Ex. 4, at 5.)

        On October 4, 2011, AMI responded to the Contract Specialist’s email stating that it had
“learned that the only way to expedite the application for a business license is to do a walk-in
application. Inasmuch as we are based in Miami, Florida, it would be improbable for us to
obtain a District Business License by 12:00 noon tomorrow.” (Id.)

                                                                              AMI Risk Consultants, Inc.
                                                                                       CAB No. P-0900



        Through a series of emails, the District attempted to work with the DC Department of
Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (“DCRA”) and AMI to resolve the licensure issue. (See AR at
Ex. 4.) At 7:36 p.m. on October 5, 2011, AMI sent an email to the Contract Specialist stating:

               Upon reading more thoroughly the requirements for District
               Business License, I have concluded that since our principals hold
               professional licenses as a [sic] Fellows of the Casualty Actuarial
               Society and the American Academy of Actuaries, our company
               does not have to register for a business license.

               ‘The General Business License applies to all businesses doing
               business in the District of Columbia who do not fall under an
               already specified category or are not professional [sic] licensed’

               ‘If a business entity is comprised of principals who are required to
               maintain licenses granted or regulated by local, state, or national
               certification board or body, the entity and its principals shall not be
               required to obtain a General Business License.’

                                               ***

               We have also mailed the application for Certificate of Authority
               with DC.

               (AR at Ex. 4, at 3-4.)

        The Contract Specialist then worked with DCRA and AMI to clarify whether AMI’s
“specific business activity . . . require[d] a business license.” (AR at Ex. 4, at 1-3.) Concurrent
to this series of email exchanges, which spanned from October 3, 2011, to October 7, 2011, the
District continued to evaluate the offeror proposals. On October 5, 2011, BAFOs were
submitted by both AMI and PRM. (AR at Ex. 1.) On October 7, 2011, Donise Peace clarified
with both the Contract Specialist and AMI that AMI was required to have a General Business
License to do business in the District of Columbia. (See AR at Ex. 4, at 1.)

     On October 13, 2011, the CO prepared and issued the Small Purchase Procurement
Summary in which he stated:

               AMI Risk Consultant is deemed non-responsible due to its failure
               to obtain a license to conduct business in the District as required in
               Sections L.2.1.5(d) and L.12.2 prior to contract award.

               (AR at Ex. 6.)

       On October 13, 2011, the District awarded the contract to PRM (AR at Ex. 1) and
submitted to the Board a Determination and Findings to Proceed with Contract Award While a

                                                                            AMI Risk Consultants, Inc.
                                                                                     CAB No. P-0900

Protest is Pending (AR at Ex. 5). The District forwarded the notice of contract award to AMI on
October 20, 2011. (AR at Ex. 1.) On November 2, 2011, AMI filed its protest of award with the
Board.

                                         DISCUSSION

        The protester has argued that the District improperly determined AMI to be
nonresponsible and, furthermore, that “the District demonstrated bad faith when dealing with
AMI Risk Consultants, Inc.” (AMI Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss 1, Dec. 2, 2011.) At issue is
whether the District properly determined that AMI was a nonresponsible bidder. If the Board
finds that the determination was proper, then AMI lacks standing to raise other challenges with
respect to the award. See Heller Elec. Co., CAB No. P-0444, 44 D.C. Reg. 6784, 6787 (Jan. 22,
1997).

I.   CO’S DETERMINATION OF AMI NONRESPONSIBILTY

        Bidder responsibility is a prerequisite to contract award. D.C. Code § 2-353.01(a)
(2011). Procurement regulations require that the contracting officer make awards only to
responsible contractors, and that the contracting officer make a written determination of whether
a prospective contractor is responsible prior to any award. D.C. Mun. Reg. tit. 27, § 2200.1-.2
(2002); see also Kidd Int’l Home Care Servs., CAB No. P-0547, 45 D.C. Reg. 8835, 8839 (Sept.
15, 1998). Furthermore, “[t]he regulations place the burden on the prospective contractor to
demonstrate its responsibility.” Grp. Ins. Admin., Inc., CAB No. P-0309-B, 40 D.C. Reg. 4485,
4517 (Sept. 2, 1992). The general standards of responsibility are set forth in D.C. Mun. Reg. tit.
27, § 2200.4 (2002) and in Section L.13 of the solicitation. (AR at Ex. 2.)

         Before making a responsibility determination, “the contracting officer shall possess or
obtain information sufficient to satisfy the contracting officer that a prospective contractor
currently meets the applicable standards and requirements for responsibility.” D.C. Mun. Reg.
tit. 27, § 2204.1 (2002). “Besides obtaining information from the prospective contractor, the
contracting officer should also obtain information on responsibility from other sources as
appropriate under the circumstances.” Children, Children, Children, Inc., CAB No. P-0858,
2011 WL 489700 (Jan. 7, 2011). “[I]n the absence of information clearly indicating that the
contractor is responsible, the contracting officer shall determine the contractor to be
nonresponsible.” Id.; see also D.C. Mun. Reg. tit. 27, § 2200.3 (2002).

        This Board has consistently held that a contracting officer has a duty to determine the
prospective contractor’s responsibility and, as such, the contracting officer is vested with wide
discretion and business judgment. See, Goel Servs., Inc., CAB No. P-0862, 2011 WL 7402962
(June 16, 2011); see also, e.g., Children, Children, Children, Inc., 2011 WL 489700; Cent.
Armature/Fort Meyer Joint Venture, CAB No. P-0478, 44 D.C. Reg. 6823, 6828 (June 6, 1997).
Therefore, “the Board will not overturn a finding of responsibility or nonresponsibility unless the
protester shows bad faith on the part of the contracting agency or that the contracting officer’s
determination lacks any reasonable basis.” Lorenz Lawn & Landscape, Inc., CAB No. P-0869,
2011 WL 7402964 (Sept. 29, 2011).



                                                5
                                                                                         AMI Risk Consultants, Inc.
                                                                                                  CAB No. P-0900

Bad Faith

        The protester has alleged bad faith on the part of the District regarding the CO’s
determination of nonresponsibility. However, “[a]ny discussion of bad faith by government
officials must begin with an analysis of the conduct that constitutes bad faith.” Goel Servs., Inc.,
2011 WL 7402962 (citing Kalvar Corp., Inc. v. United States, 211 Ct. Cl. 192 (1976)). “It is
well-established that procurement officials are presumed to act in good faith; and in order for this
Board to conclude otherwise, the record must show that the procuring official had a specific,
malicious intent to harm the protestor.” Grp. Ins. Admin., Inc., CAB No. P-0309, 40 D.C. Reg.
at 4518. Evidence sufficient to sustain a claim of bad faith must rise to the level of ‘irrefragable
proof’ showing bad faith “actuated by animus toward the plaintiff.” Librach v. United States,
147 Ct. Cl. 605, 614 (1959), adopted in Goel Servs., Inc., 2011 WL 7402962.

        In this case, protester’s bad faith allegation stems from the terms of the RFP. The
protester claims:

                 [I]t is in bad faith for the District to suggest that intent to get a
                 license is sufficient to satisfy the RFP and then to disqualify the
                 proposer for not having a business license at the time of award –
                 knowing full well that the District cannot process the license
                 application by the time of award.

                 (AMI Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss 1.)

        However, the protester has not proffered the evidence necessary to demonstrate a specific
malicious intent on the part of the CO in order to establish bad faith. To the contrary, a review of
the record shows that OCP took many actions to aid the protester in resolving its licensing issues.
The Contract Specialist spoke with DCRA on many occasions on behalf of protester.1 (See AR
at Ex. 4.) Furthermore, the record evidences that OCP seriously considered the protester’s claim
that it was exempt from the requirement of having a business license. Specifically, the Contract
Specialist contacted DCRA and asked a representative to analyze whether the protester needed a
business license. (See AR at Ex. 4, at 1.) Therefore, the record does not support an allegation
that the terms of the RFP were written by OCP with the specific intent of injuring protester.
Accordingly, there is no evidence that the determination of nonresponsibility with respect to the
protester was made in bad faith.

Reasonable Basis



1
  The District provides for expedited license processing with a walk-in application. (See AR at Ex. 4, at 5.) Since
protester is based in the state of Florida (AR at Ex. 4, at 12), that process may have been inconvenient. However,
under the terms of the solicitation, it was incumbent on potential offerors to “read and understand fully all
information and requirements contained in the solicitation,” (AR at Ex. 2a, § L.5) and “thoroughly familiarize
themselves with the terms and conditions of this solicitation, acquainting themselves with all available information
regarding difficulties which may be encountered,” (AR at Ex. 2a, § L.3). Therefore, it was solely protester’s
responsibility to research and comply with the business licensing requirements in the District of Columbia.


                                                         6
                                                                                           AMI Risk Consultants, Inc.
                                                                                                    CAB No. P-0900

        Additionally, it was reasonable for the CO to determine that AMI was a nonresponsible
offeror. The General Standards of Responsibility clearly stated that it was incumbent upon the
prospective contractor to “demonstrate to the satisfaction of the District its capability in all
respects to perform fully the contract requirements,” including “[e]vidence of compliance with
the applicable District licensing and tax laws and regulations.[2]” (AR at Ex. 2a, §§ L.13,
L.13.4.) Notably, by the time that the contracting officer was required to make the determination
of responsibility:

         (1) AMI had claimed that it was exempt from the requirement of Business License; (AR
             at Ex. 4, at 3-4)
         (2) DCRA determined that AMI was required to have a General Business License in
             order to do business in the District of Columbia; (AR at Ex. 4, at 1)
         (3) AMI was unable or unwilling to take advantage of the District’s expedited application
             process; (AR at Ex. 4, at 5)
         (4) The term of the contract was relatively short, all performance was to be completed in
             six months, and required the awardee to start performing immediately; (See AR at Ex.
             2, § F.1.2) and
         (5) The General Standards of Responsibility required prospective contractors to be in
             compliance with applicable District licensing laws, (AR at Ex. 2a, § L.13.4).

        In light of this record, the Board has no reason to overturn the CO’s determination that
the protester was a nonresponsible bidder. Given the expedited nature of the contract, requiring
performance to be completed within a short period of time, the CO was justifiably concerned
about the status of protester’s business license. Furthermore, procurement regulations state that
if there is an absence of information “clearly indicating that the prospective contractor is
responsible, the contracting officer shall make a determination of nonresponsibility.” D.C. Mun.
Regs. tit. 27, § 2200.3 (2002).

II. PRM’s QUALIFICATION

         The Board finds that the protester was properly determined to be nonresponsible and,
therefore, lacks standing to challenge PRM’s qualification to perform the contract. As a result of
its status as a nonresponsible bidder, protester would not be next in line for award even if this
Board were to determine that PRM was not qualified to perform the contract. “A protester lacks
standing where it would not be in line for award even if its protest were upheld.” C.P.F. Corp.,
CAB No. P-0521, 45 D.C. Reg. 8697, 8699 (Jan. 12, 1998) (citing Am. Combustion Indus., CAB
No. P-0499, 44 D.C. Reg. 6896 (Aug. 14, 1997); see also Unfoldment, Inc., CAB No. P-0358, 41
D.C. Reg. 3666 (Sept. 17, 1993). Accordingly, the CO is legally barred from awarding the

  This Board has held that “these very types of registrations, licenses and certification requirements . . . may be met
by a bidder after bid opening and even after contract award.” Lorenz Lawn & Landscape, Inc., CAB No. P-0869,
2011 WL 7402964 (citing C & D Tree Servs., Inc., D.C. CAB No. P-0440, 44 D.C. Reg. 6426, 6433-6439 (Mar. 11,
1996) (discussing solicitation requirements concerning the “District of Columbia license, registration or certification
that the bidder is required by law to obtain” and other language that closely parallels the requirements of the present
solicitation)). However, there was a short timeframe for contract performance and we have also established that
these registrations are “matters of responsibility.” Id.

CONCLUSION

      For the reasons discussed herein, we sustain the CO’s nonresponsibility determination,
deny AMI’s protest in part and dismiss the protest in part.
