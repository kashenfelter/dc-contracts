                                   OPINION

       This protest was filed by Byrd's Paint & Decorating Center (Byrd) on
November 4, 1987. 2     See Byrd's protest letter dated November 2, 1987.
Byrd protests the District's award of a contract to General Merchandise,
Inc.   (GMI) under Invitation for Bids No. 8006-AA-80-0-8-KC (IFB) on two
grounds. 3    The first ground of the protest in effect alleges that the bid
GMI submitted in connection with the IFB is nonresponsive because it is
materially unbalanced.      The second ground alleges that GMI and another

     1Judge Sharpe's participation in this case is pursuant to the
authority contained in the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985, D.C.
Code, sec. 1-1189.2(c) (2) (1987).
     2This case originated during the period when the District of
Columbia Contract Appeals Board was functioning pursuant to
Commissioner's Order No.9, D.C. Code, Supplement V (1978), as amended by
Mayor's Order 86-65, 33 DCR 3006 (May 16, 1986). Pursuant to the D.C.
Procurement Practices Act of 1985 (PPA), D.C. Code, sec. 1-1189.1(1987),
a new independent agency denominated as the Contract Appeals Board was
created.   This new Board became operational on August 1, 1988, and
succeeded to the jurisdiction of all cases pending before the previously
established Board.
     3Byrd made a number of new allegations in its comments on the agency
report and during a telephone conference between the Board and the
parties which we do not concern ourselves with for the reason that they
1re either untimely or not a proper subject of protest.

bidder     (Jo-Na Corporation)   failed to submit with their bid a sworn
affidavit as instructed by the IFB provision entitled, Business Interest
in the Republic of South Africa or Namibia (see IFB at 38 and 39).          Byrd
closes its protest with the following:
        In conclusion we feel that General Merchandise, being a newly
        formed corporation (12-24-86) overreacted in bidding this bid.
        We feel that they are not being responsible to the District and
        should be rejected as a bidder from this bid.

                                  I. Bl\.CKGROUND

A.      Solicitation and Award
        The IFB was issued on August 28,       1987,    and solicited bids from
certified minority firms for various paints and painting supplies.           See
IFB 1 - 24.     For award purposes, these items were set forth in aggregate
groups and as individual items.        Id. and IFB at 34, para. 4.       The IFB
provided for the award of an estimated quantities contract for a one-year
base period with an option to extend the contract for one additional
year.     See IFB General Conditions, para. 25, Estimated Quantities; and
IFB at 40, para.      12, Term of Contract.         Most significantly, the IFB
contains an Evaluation of options provision (EO provision or provision)
which advises all prospective bidders that a bid could be rejected as
nonresponsive "if it is materially unbalanced as to prices for the basic
requirement and the option requirement."            See IFB at 40, Evaluation of
Options, subpara. b.      The    prospective bidders were also informed that
the contract would be awarded on the basis of the lowest combined price
after "adding the total price for all options to the total price for the
basic requirement."     See IFB at 40, Evaluation of Options, subpara. a.
                                            - 3 -

       A number of minority firms responded to the IFB with a bid.                       None of
the bidders, however, submitted a bid on all of the items specified in
the IFB.        See Agency Report of the District of Columbia                         (District's
Agency Report) at 3 and 4.              with respect to the aggregate groups Byrd
calls attention to in its protest (the aggregate groups covering items 1-
23, 55-62 and 63-71), GMI submitted the lowest price for each group.                          See
District's Agency Report at 4.

B.     Position of the Parties
       1.   Materially Unbalanced Bid
       In an apparent effort to demonstrate that GMI' s bid is materially
unbalanced, Byrd lays out in its protest letter three charts, each of
which includes columns setting forth GMI' s bid price for certain IFB
items, the price offered by three other bidders (Duron distributors) for
the same items and the 1987 and 1986 contract award price for each item.
Byrd    notes    after    each chart        the considerable percentage difference
between some of GMI's bid prices and the bid prices of the three Duron
distributors. 4          In     addition,     Byrd    comments     that   the        considerable
disparity between GMI's bid prices                    and the Duron distributor's bid
prices,     coupled      with    the   fact    that    the   bid    prices      of    the   Duron
distributors are all within a very small range of one another, indicates
that GMI's prices are significantly less than cost.                          Aside from the
points just discussed, Byrd does not present in its protest letter any




     4The percentage differences between GMI' s prices and all of the
other Duron distributors varied somewhat between a low of 15% and a high
of 38% ..
                                       - 4 -

other analyses or arguments in support of its position that GMI's bid is
materially unbalanced.
     Because Byrd's protest is void of an allegation that GMI' s bid
prices are unbalanced as to prices for the basic year items and the
options year items, the District argues that under the terms of the EO
provision, Byrd has not stated a materially unbalanced bid case.                   The
District asserts that indeed such a case cannot be made in view of the
fact that GMI' s bid does not include nominal prices for the basic year
items and enhanced prices for the same items for the option year.                  The
District    cites   several    U.S.     Comptroller   General   decisions   for    the
proposition that a bid cannot be materially unbalanced unless it is
mathematically unbalanced.            It urges that we give great deference to
these decisions in deciding the instant case as they reflect a thorough
consideration of the circumstances under which a bid should be considered
materially unbalanced and nonresponsive.
     The District argues that even if GMI' s             bid were mathematically
unbalanced, the District would not have been required to reject it as
nonresponsive because an award to GMI for the items at issue will result
in the lowest cost to the District.            In this regard, the District makes
the observation that Byrd has not alleged that the acceptance of GMI' s
bid will not result in the lowest cost to the District, but rather only
argues that GMI's bid is unbalanced simply because some of its bid prices
are allegedly below cost.       In the situation where a firm submits a below-
cost bid,     the   District argues the        Board should hold,      as   the U.S.
Comptroller    General   has    consistently     held,   that   the   bid   does   not
necessarily have to be rejected as nonresponsive but that the low cost
                                            - 5 -

aspect of the bid should be considered in a determination of the bidder's

responsibility.


      2.    Failure to Submit Affidavit with Bid

      Byrd contends that because GMI did not submit with its bid the

affidavit requested by the Business Interest in the Republic of South

Africa and Namibia provision, the 6% evaluation differential specified in

paragraph     D of      the provision should be applied to GMI' s             bid.      The

District concedes that GMI failed to submit the affidavit, but argues

that under the Materiel Management Manual, sec. 2620.14, the failure is

curable as a minor informality.               See District's Agency Report at 13 and

14.         Moreover,    the   District argues,      there were      no   regulations    in

existence     at   the    time   of   the     procurement   "which   would   permit     the

application of a penalty to the bid price of a bidder with business

interest in South Africa or Namibia."               See District's Agency Report at

14.     (The District does not give any indication of the status of the

regulations. )

                                      II.     DISCUSSION

A.    Materially Unbalanced Bid

       Byrd's materially unbalanced bid allegation, without question, rests

on the EO provision.             Since we have not previously considered this

provision,     it is necessary that we examine it in some detail.                       The

provision reads in full as follows:

       EVALUATION OF OPTIONS

       a.     The Government will evaluate proposal (sic) bids for
              award purposes by adding the total price for all
              options to the total price for the basic requirement.
              Evaluation of options will not obligate the
              Government to exercise the options(s) [sic].
                                           - 6 -

        b.    The Government may reject an offer as nonresponsive
              if it is materially unbalanced as to prices for the
              basic requirement and the option requirement.      An
              offer is unbalanced when it is based on prices
              significantly less than cost for some work and prices
              which are significantly overstated for other work.
        c.    A prospective contractor may be determined non-
              responsive if he or she fails to bid on the option
              items.
        This provision warns that a bid which is materially unbalanced as to
the prices for the basic year items and option year items may be rejected
by the District as nonresponsive to the invitation for bids. 5                   It is most
significant that the provision apprises the bidders of the risk of
submitting a materially unbalanced bid and gives no warning respecting a
bid which is merely unbalanced (a bid which is merely unbalanced is also
commonly referred to as a mathematically unbalanced bid).                     Insofar as it
is relevant to the issue we are now addressing, the operative words in
the     EO provision are        "materially unbalanced".             While the provision
explains when a bid is unbalanced it does not go on to expressly state
when a bid is "materially" unbalanced.                 We therefore look to the reason
behind the provision to discern when a bid is "materially" unbalanced.
        The   procurement      regulations         (Material     Management   Manual,     sec.
2620.16 A.) which were in effect at the time the IFB was issued, provided

that     "           award    shall   be    made               to the lowest responsive
responsible bidder whose bid .                     will be most advantageous to            the
D. c.    Government. "       Setting other considerations aside,              this language
requires      that   the     District      award    what   was    formerly    called    formal


    5It is noted that the EO provlslon does not speak to a bid which is
materially unbalanced as between the prices for basic year items alone.
                                      - 7 -

advertised contracts and now is called sealed bidding contracts to the
lowest bidder.     This requirement has been carried forward in the PPA
(sec.1-1183.3(e)) and the District's current procurement regulations (27
DCMR sec. 1541.1).    Given the mandate that contracts are to be awarded to
the low bidder, we think it apparent that the purpose of the EO provision
is to inform bidders that if there is an imbalance between their base
year prices and option year prices, their bids are at risk in terms of
not being accepted for award, if an evaluation of the imbalanced prices
reveals that the prices do not constitute the low bid. 6            We, therefore,
consider a bid to be materially unbalanced               (for purposes of the EO
provision)    if it is mathematically unbalanced and it can be reasonably
said that it will not likely result in a contract award representing the
lowest ultimate price to the District.
     Before    closing   out   this   discussion,   we    note   that the   Federal
government utilizes a clause substantially similar to the EO provision. 7
See the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR),             48 C.F.R. sec. 52.217-5
(1986), entitled Evaluation of Options.         We further note that the U. S .
Comptroller General, the General Services Board of Contract Appeals and
at least one federal court have defined materially unbalanced similarly
as we have in this opinion.      Se~, ~.,     Professional Waste Systems, Inc.;

     6We note that subparagraph B. of the EO provision states that the
District "may" reject a materially unbalanced bid.        The provision,
however, does not state any guidelines for the exercise of the District's
discretion.   It is therefore questionable under what circumstances the
District would or would not reject a materially unbalanced bid.       The
District may therefore wish to consider whether a revision to the EO
provision in this regard is in order.
    7This is not to say, however, that we necessarily agree with the
authorities' application of the stated definition in all respects.

affect the integrity of the competitive bidding system. ")                          (Citing ABC
Siding;   TWI    Inc.,    61 Compo     Gen.       99,   103    (1981».      See also Severn

Automated Services. Inc.       V.    united States, 658 F. Supp. 28 (D. D.C. 1987).
     with the above principles in mind, we now turn to the question of
whether GMI submitted a materially unbalanced bid as alleged by Byrd.                        We
pointed out earlier, a materially unbalanced bid under the EO provision
presupposes that the bid is unbalanced mathematically.                       We too observed
(as we noted the District so observed in its agency report) that Byrd
does not allege that the pricing structure or GMI' s bid is such that
there exists a significant differential between the prices for the basic
year and option year items.           Rather, Byrd only alleges that GMI's prices
were below cost and, ergo, GMI's bid is materially unbalanced.
     The EO provision defines an unbalanced bid as one "based on prices
significantly      less    than     cost    for     some      work   and   prices    which   are
significantly overstated for other work."                     In light of this definition
                                    - 9 -

and the fact that a mathematically unbalanced bid is an indispensable
requirement to a materially unbalanced bid finding, it is clear Byrd's
contention alone that GMI's bid is based on below cost prices              is
insufficient to state a materially unbalanced bid case.          Despite the
shortcoming in Byrd's statement of its protest ground, we compared GMI's
prices for the basic year items and the option year items.             Before
stating our finding in this regard, we note that the IFB' s schedule of
items for the basic year consists of 93 individual items.      These 93 items
are repeated in the IFB's schedule of items for the option year.        GMI's
item prices for the option year are the same as its item prices for the
basic year.      We therefore find that the price structure of GMI's bid does
not fit the EO provision's definition of an unbalanced bid.       Because the
first test for finding a bid to be materially unbalanced has not been
met, we need not proceed to what would otherwise be the second test for
determining if a bid is materially unbalanced, i.e., to determine whether
acceptance of the mathematically unbalanced bid will likely result in the
lowest ultimate cost to the District.
     Assuming that GMI 's bid consists of below-cost prices,         as Byrd
alleges, we cannot glean from the record GMI' s reason for quoting the
below-cost prices.      We can only presume that GMI purposely did this for a
reason that would be advantageous to it.       In any event, as the District
asserts,   the    submission of a    bid which includes below-cost prices,
without more, is a matter which goes to the responsibility of the bidder
and not whether the bid is materially unbalanced.       Byrd does not allege
in its protest letter that GMI is a nonresponsible bidder.         The first
time Byrd does this is in its comments on the District's agency report.
                                    - 10 -
Because the allegation at that time does not satisfy the ten-working day
requirement for filing a protest ground, we do not address it.
       Based on the foregoing discussion, we conclude that there is no
merit to Byrd's allegation that GMI's bid is materially unbalanced.

B.     Requirement to SUbmit Affidavit
       We now turn to Byrd's allegation that GMI failed to submit with its
bid the    affidavit     requested by the     IFB's   Business   Interest in The
Republic of South Africa or Namibia provision (South African provision).8
       The South African provision apparently relates to the PPA,             as
amended May 23,        1986,   by the   "South Africa and Namibia Contracting
Sanction Amendment Act of 1986," D.C. Law 6-116, sec. 2, 33 DCR 2432,
D.C.   Code,   secs.   1-1192.1 to 1-1192.6     (Act).    The Act,   among other
things, states that the rules necessary to implement its provision were
to be issued as a part of the District's procurement regulations within
60 days of May 23, 1986.         See sec. 1-1192.6(a).    The Act also provided
for the Council of the District of Columbia's approval or disapproval of
the rules.     In this connection, we note that paragraph D of the South
African provision states that after the promulgation of regulations by
the District, a bidder doing business in South Africa or Namibia shall be
subject to a price penalty (not to exceed 6%)            for the purpose of bid
evaluations only.
       Since there were no regulations in effect at the time the IFB was
iSSUed, we are at a loss to understand why the District incorporated the


     8As the District found Jo-Na Corporation to be nonresponsible and
did not award a contract to it, we do not include in our discussion
Byrd's allegation that Jo-Na Corporation also did not submit an affidavit.
                                                                        - 11 -

South African provision into the IFB.                                              Whatever the reason, we observe
that        the       Act        makes            clear             that    the    completion    of   the   statutorily
prescribed rulemaking procedure was necessary before the District could
implement its provisions.                                        Thus, inasmuch as the prerequisite for the
implementation of the South African provision had not been satisfied at
the time of procurement, we view the inclusion of South African provision
in the IFB as premature and therefore a nullity.                                                For this reason, we do
not discuss further the question raised by Byrd's allegation.
          Finally, we note that Byrd submitted with its comments on the agency
report certain materials                                        (marked Exhibit 7)       to be withheld from the
District's examination.                                 We reviewed, in camera, the information in the
exhibit and determined it to be irrelevant to the issues in this protest.
For this and other reasons, the exhibit was not considered by us in
reaching our conclusions.
                                                                           ORDER
