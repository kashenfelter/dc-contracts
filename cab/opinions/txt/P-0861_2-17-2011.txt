                                            OPINION
                                        Filing ID 36021303

        On July 10, 2010, Certified Learning Centers (“CLC”) protested the District’s Child and
Family Services Agency’s (“CFSA”) decision to award contracts under this solicitation to bidders
other than CLC. The protester alleged that CFSA discriminated against CLC during the selection
process. CLC alleges that CFSA did not visit CLC’s work site, and therefore, did not evaluate CLC
in the same manner that CFSA evaluated other bidders. The District responded in its Motion to
Dismiss that CLC is not next in line for award even if CLC succeeds in its protest, and that CLC
lacks standing to bring the protest.

                                        BACKGROUND

        On December 9, 2009, CFSA issued IFB CFSA-09-I-0004 for an indefinite delivery
indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contract to provide home based and community based supplemental
educational services, tutoring, and remediation services in individual sessions or group settings to
wards (students) of the District of Columbia in the care, custody and control of CFSA. The IFB
contemplated award of an IDIQ contract with fixed unit hourly prices. (AR Ex. 2). CFSA received
20 bids by December 29, 2009. (AR Ex. 1 and 3). CFSA prepared a bid tabulation sheet that set
forth the rankings of the 20 bidders. (AR Ex. 3). CLC’s offer was the seventeenth lowest priced
bid, out of the 20 bids received.

       Between June 2 and June 9, 2010, CFSA awarded four contracts to bidders with higher
rankings and lower prices than CLC. CLC filed this protest on July 16, 2010.


                                          DISCUSSION

       We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03(a)(1).

       CLC Asserts that the District did not visit CLC’s work site, and that CLC was not given the
                                                    -2-               Certified Learning Centers. CAB No. P-0861



opportunity to show its capabilities to the District. The District replies that even if CLC’s assertion
were true, CLC could not be awarded the contract because CLC, at rank number 17, is not next in
line for award. The District asserts that there are six bidders between CLC and the lowest priced
bidder that did not get a contract. Accordingly, CLC is not next in line for award unless CLC can
somehow remove six bidders whose bids are lower priced than CLC’s.

         This Board has granted District motions to dismiss protests when the bidder is not next in
line for award. In Commando K-9 Detectives and Executive Security & Engineering Technologies,
Inc., CAB Nos. P-405, P-406 (Consolidated), 42 DCR 4597 (Aug 18, 1995), this Board sustained a
District Motion to Dismiss the Protest because the protester was seventh in line for award and would
not be next in line for award even if the Board sustained the protest. The Board stated:

                   Only aggrieved persons have standing to protest agency award decisions. In order to
           have standing, an actual or prospective bidder or offeror must show that it has suffered, or
           will suffer, a direct economic injury as a result of the alleged adverse agency action. District
           of Columbia v. Group Insurance Administration, 633 A.2d 2, 18-19 (D.C. 1993). A protestor
           lacks standing where it would not be in line for award, even if its protest were upheld.
           Unfoldment, Inc., CAB No. P-358, (Sept. 17, 1993), 6 P.D. 5399, 5401-02. The record
           demonstrates that neither Commando nor Executive would be in line for award even if their
           protests were sustained.

See also American Combustion Industries, Inc., CAB No. P-499, (August 14, 1997).

           Accordingly, we dismiss the protest.

                                                 CONCLUSION
           For the reasons discussed above, we grant the District’s motion and dismiss CLC’s
protest.
