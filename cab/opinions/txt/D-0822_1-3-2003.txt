        Appellants A.A. Beiro Construction Company and Fidelity and Deposit Company of
Maryland seek termination for convenience costs arising from the District’s converted termination
for default of Appellant Beiro’s contract to construct a prevocational/vocational school building.
We find Appellants and their subcontractors entitled to unpaid costs of performance of $1,682,337,
settlement costs of $131,004, and interest on those amounts pursuant to former section 806 of D.C.
Law 6-85 (formerly D.C. Code § 1-1188.6, recodified at § 2-308.06).

                                             FINDINGS

        This case arises out of a 1984 contract for the construction of the former Prevocational
Vocational/Education Facility for the Handicapped at First Street, N.W. The District issued its
notice to proceed for the project on July 9, 1984, and work was to be complete by June 9, 1986, a
700-day performance period. There is no dispute that there were significant design defects and
dimensional errors in the District’s plans and specifications which had been prepared for the District
under a separate contract by an architect-engineering firm. In February 1985, an elevated concrete
slab evidenced deflection and cracking. Certain concrete columns also contained cracking. The
District issued a stop work order on all construction in February 1986, alleging that Beiro had not
complied with concrete strength requirements. (DEX 227). Beiro took the position that “the
deflection and ultimate cracking of the beams and slabs clearly is a design problem, not a material
installation problem.” On April 23, 1986, the District converted the stop work into a suspension of
work, noting that the architect took the position that the design was adequate and that the problems
were caused by faulty construction, and that an independent consultant blamed the problems on both
construction and design deficiencies. (DEX 228). The suspension notice stated that the District
would have to “re-evaluate the entire situation,” that “in view of the scope of the problems and the
complexity of the liability issues involved, we estimate that a complete evaluation will take about six
                                                 -2-                  A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



months,” and that Beiro should mitigate costs for the duration of the suspension (Id.).

        In February 1987, Beiro and DPW began discussing resumption of work on the project and
negotiating costs of outstanding Beiro proposed change orders (“PCOs”), which numbered well over
100 at the time. For reasons including a change in the District’s need for such an educational facility
as well as the economic infeasibility of taking corrective action in order to complete construction,
the District decided to end the project without completing construction and eventually demolished
the incomplete structure. (AEX 133; AEX 429, at 9). The District terminated Beiro’s contract for
default on July 31, 1987, alleging defective concrete placement, and filed a separate claim against
the architect. The District and the architect ultimately settled that claim. See Fry & Welch
Associates, CAB No. D-821, July 31, 1997, 44 D.C. Reg. 6859, 6860-61; Board Order, CAB No. D-
821, dated February 27, 1998. Appellants filed an administrative appeal with the then-Director of
the Department of Administrative Services who denied Beiro’s appeal on June 15, 1989. Beiro then
appealed the default termination to the Board on July 14, 1989. In a March 30, 1992 decision, the
Board defaulted the District on the issue of the propriety of the District=s termination action as a
sanction for failing to proceed to hearing. After converting the default to a convenience termination,
the Board conducted a hearing on Beiro=s termination costs in April 1992 and thereafter issued a
decision awarding Appellants their termination costs. In a June 27, 1996 decision, the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals reversed the Board=s order holding the District in default and remanded
the case to the Board for a hearing on the merits.

        Following remand to the Board, the District determined that it no longer wished to defend the
propriety of the default termination, and on May 1, 1997, it issued a notice to Beiro converting the
default termination to one for the convenience of the District. The Board directed the parties after
remand to begin negotiating a convenience termination settlement and supplemental auditing as
necessary.1 Appellants advised that the owner of Beiro had disposed of the trailer containing most
of the bankrupt company’s original records at some point during the pendency of the court appeal,
probably in 1995.2 Ultimately, the parties were unsuccessful in negotiating a termination settlement.
In 1998, the Board held a hearing on quantum to supplement the hearing that had been held in 1992.

1
  The District moved to remand the quantum determination to the contracting officer but the Board
decided to retain jurisdiction while encouraging the District to make such a determination. In its
posthearing brief, the District again challenges the Board’s jurisdiction but we reject its arguments
for the reasons expressed in our prior decisions on these matters. (E.g., Board Order, dated May 5,
1997; Board Order, dated September 5, 1997).
2
  Based on the loss of these records, the District argues that it did not have meaningful access to
Beiro’s financial records. We find that the District had ample opportunity to review, audit, and
discover Beiro’s financial records from the time of termination through the February 1992 discovery
cutoff for the original hearing in 1992. The District chose to wait to the end of the discovery period
to review and copy Beiro records. At no time did the Board prohibit the District from exercising its
audit rights. Thus, the request for a blanket sanction against Appellants must be rejected. As
described in our determinations on each element of Appellants’ termination costs, infra, the Board
has carefully reviewed the entire record and has sustained costs only where adequate support exists.

       Appellants’ Termination Claims

        Appellants initially engaged Ernst & Young in 1990 to prepare their termination settlement
proposal. (Tr. 28-29). Ernst & Young analyzed Beiro’s accounting records and prepared a report in
1991-1992 setting forth the termination for convenience costs for the Prevocational Facility project.
(Tr. 28-30; AEX 236). Just prior to the 1992 quantum hearing, Ernst & Young issued an update of
the original cost report. (AEX 362). In May 1998, prior to the supplemental 1998 quantum hearing,
Ernst & Young issued a new report that updated and adjusted the earlier cost report. (Tr. 32-33;
AEX 458). Ernst & Young used Beiro’s October 8, 1987 detailed job cost report as the starting
point for the cost analysis because it was the latest available detailed job cost report. (Tr. 310; AEX
236, at 3). Vendor and subcontractor payments were copied from Beiro’s detailed job cost report
into Ernst & Young databases to facilitate the analysis and presentation of the information. (Tr. 51-
52; AEX 236, at 20-45, 49-53). Using invoices, check carbons, ledgers, transaction reports, and
other supporting documents, Ernst & Young confirmed the vast majority of the vendor and
subcontractor costs reported in Beiro’s detailed job cost report and found no basis for questioning
the accuracy of Beiro's cost report. (Tr. 310-312, 50-54, 56, 59-63, 498). Beiro’s cost accounting
system was instituted with the assistance of a certified public accounting firm. (Tr. 211). During the
contract period, Arthur Young and then Ernst & Whinney served as outside accountants for Beiro.
(Tr. 201). Based on the documentary record and the testimony, we find that Beiro’s cost accounting
system properly tracked and recorded job costs and expenditures. (Tr. 176-81).

A.     Unpaid Costs of Performance

       As adjusted through the supplemental quantum hearing and briefing, Appellants seek
$7,323,439 in termination costs as follows:

                       Total Revised Termination Claim               $7,323,439

               1. Labor Costs

        Ernst & Young compiled a database of direct labor costs from Beiro’s weekly job time
reports and payroll data sheets. (Tr. 40-41). This database, the “Labor Supplement” to Ernst &
Young’s 1992 termination claim report (AEX 236) lists for the entire job every Beiro worker who
charged labor to the job, by week, wage rate, and total wages paid. (Tr. 41, 305-06). Using this
data, Ernst & Young determined that Beiro’s direct labor costs on the project were $790,285. (AEX
458, at 14; AEX 236, at 4-5, 17, Labor Supplement; AEX 449; AEX 208).

        Ernst & Young determined that Beiro incurred $238,020 for labor burden, comprising
indirect labor costs for FICA, FUTA, SUTA, workmen’s compensation insurance, and a cost item
called “Union Burden” for additional fringe benefits required by the Davis Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. §
276a. The labor burden costs were determined by calculating the ratio of direct labor costs to labor
burden from Beiro’s October 8,1987 job cost report, which yielded a burden rate of 30.12 percent,
and multiplying that rate by the supported labor costs of $790,285. (Tr. 42-43). Ernst & Young
believe that the labor burden rate of 30.12 percent was reasonable. (Tr. 43; Tr. 1410).

        The District claims that Ernst & Young did not use generally accepted accounting standards
to verify labor costs and labor burden. The District also points to a discrepancy of approximately
$80,000 between Beiro’s direct labor costs as reported on its job time reports, amounting to
$790,285, and its direct labor costs identified on the job cost report, dated October 8, 1987,
amounting to $870,497. Beiro explains that an amount of $60,400 of “Union Burden” was included
in the job cost report’s labor account but was not included in the payroll records supporting the
$790,285 in labor costs. (Tr. 42-43, 217; AEX 458, at 14; AEX 464; AEX 408). Beiro states that
the remaining differences are attributable to minor additional labor costs and end of the year
accounting adjustments related to the taxes and workmen’s compensation accounts. (AEX 408;
AEX 458).

        We find adequate support in the record for direct labor costs of $790,285, the labor burden
rate of 30.12, and labor burden costs of $238,020.



               2. Materials, Equipment Rental & Direct General Costs

       Appellants originally claimed costs of $1,062,332 for materials, equipment rental, and direct
                                                 -5-                  A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



general costs. (AEX 236, at 4, 6-7, 19). In its revised report, it excluded an amount of $41,642 for
an F&D bond premium, yielding claimed costs of $1,020,690. (AEX 458, at 6, 16). During the
hearing, Appellants withdrew an additional $5,922.50 paid to Sadur & Pelland, thus reducing its
claim for materials, equipment rental, and direct general costs to $1,014,767. (Tr. 13-14). The cost
amounts were obtained directly from Beiro’s detailed job cost report, dated October 8, 1987, and
from F&D’s bond payment records (arising from F&D’s takeover of the job). (Tr. 44-45). To
support the materials, equipment rental, and direct general costs, Ernst & Young also used the
“Prevocational” invoices and check carbons, the “General” invoices and check carbons, and the
F&D Approval Sheets. (Tr. 44; AEX 465). A summary job cost report dated January 13, 1988,
shows total costs of $1,086,103. (AEX 408; Tr. 54-55). Although the original detailed job cost
report no longer exists, Ernst & Young prepared a database which is found in Schedule 3 of Ernst &
Young’s original cost report (AEX 236, at 20-45) replicating the data from the Beiro detailed job
cost report. The database captures the detail of the cost report to the invoice level and contains over
1,150 invoices identified by cost type, cost code, date of invoice, vender name, invoice amount, and
description. After preparing the database, Ernst & Young reviewed actual invoices totaling
$824,741 against the invoice information in the database, determined whether the type of costs were
appropriate for the job, and examined check carbons to verify that Beiro paid the amounts. (AEX
236, at 6, 19; Tr. 48-55, 308-311). Ernst & Young did not discover any invoice amounts that were
improperly coded to the Prevocational Facility job. (Tr. 50-51, 311). Based on its testing
procedures, Ernst & Young believes that the $1,014,767 amount accurately reflects the actual costs
for materials, equipment rental, and direct general costs. (Tr. 50-54).

        The District argues first that there is a discrepancy of approximately $100,000 between the
material and rental equipment costs developed from the October 8, 1987 detailed job cost report
($1,020,541.55) and the costs reported on the January 16, 1988 job cost report, which, according to
the District, identifies only $853,699.15 in material and equipment rental costs and $45,067.62 for
small tools and equipment. However, the District has neglected to consider the 1988 job cost report
amounts for other direct general costs under cost codes 151-152 and 155-161 which total an
additional $165,145.10. (AEX 408; Tr. 54-55).

        The District also argues that Ernst and Young did not properly verify that the listed amounts
were actually paid to vendors because Beiro had a practice of holding checks after they were signed
and after an invoice was marked “paid.” The record shows that although Beiro sometimes held a
written check for a subcontractor or supplier until Beiro received funds from the project owner, it
happened infrequently on the Prevocational job. The practice was ended by Beiro’s outside
accounting firm, Ernst & Whinney, in approximately October 1986, F&D advanced Beiro money to
pay subcontractors and suppliers, and by November 30, 1986, there were no withheld checks relating
to the Prevocational job. (Tr. 219-223, 249-250, 839-843, 847; AEX 418). The District has not
identified any instance in the record where Beiro’s cost records indicate that a payment was made to
a subcontractor or supplier but the subcontractor or supplier was in fact never paid.

         Next the District argues that certain costs for tools and rental equipment are duplicated in
Appellants’ owned equipment cost schedule. (District Br. 103). One piece of rental equipment at
issue is a Kohler generator listed in Schedule 3 at a cost of $1,157.56 and a payment date of October
                                                -6-                  A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



31, 1984. On Schedule 5 of Ernst & Young’s original cost report (AEX 236, at 54, 60), equipment
item G49 described as a “Generator – Lowcycle” is listed with an arrival date of August 1984.
Beiro’s equipment listing by location report (AEX 447, at 401445) shows that this generator was
purchased on August 28, 1984. Based on a comparison of the record documentation, we find it
unlikely that the entries in Schedule 3 and Schedule 5 refer to the same piece of equipment. The
District also claims that a “transit, tripod” acquired from Thorpe-SMI at a cost of $1,768 (Schedule
3, at 41) duplicates the transit listed at equipment item T286 in Appellants’ owned equipment listing
(Schedule 5, at 64). We have removed item T286 from Appellants’ owned equipment Schedule 5.
The District appears to challenge three entries totaling $5,230 in Schedule 3 (at 32) for equipment
rental from Lago Limit, a Beiro-related equipment company, for the months of February, April, and
July 1985. We are unable to find corresponding entries in Schedule 5 for owned equipment and the
District does not point us to any. We see no basis for excluding the $5,230 in Schedule 3. Finally,
we do not find support in the record for the District’s assertion that Ernst & Young did not
adequately determine whether Beiro’s material and rental equipment costs were reasonable and
appropriate. The example of the telephone charges raised by the District is not persuasive.

        The District also claims that costs in Schedule 3 for material, equipment rental, and direct
general costs include costs for equipment repair parts, equipment repair services, and maintenance
services which are duplicated in Beiro’s general and administrative expenses summarized in
Schedule 7. The District notes that in a Beiro financial statement called “Summary of Other
Contracts Costs” for 1984 and 1985, there is a category of indirect costs for “Repairs, maintenance
and operations of automotive and construction equipment, including indirect labor.” Because we
have removed those costs from the G&A costs in Schedule 7 (see infra), the Schedule 3 costs for
repair and maintenance will not be duplicated in Schedule 7.

       In sum, we find adequate support in the record for material, equipment rental, and direct
general costs totaling $1,014,767.

               3. Subcontractor Costs

        Appellants originally claimed subcontractor costs of $3,925,685, consisting of $3,314,972
paid by Beiro and $610,713 paid by F&D. (AEX 236, at 4, 7, 48). In its revised report, Ernst &
Young included an additional amount of $170,000, representing a payment by F&D to R.R.A. in
settlement of a subcontractor claim, yielding total subcontractor costs of $4,095,685. (AEX 458, at
4, 6, 18). During the hearing, Appellants withdrew claims in the amount of $13,472, thereby
reducing subcontractor costs to $4,082,213. (Tr. 811-812). The cost amounts were obtained from
Beiro’s October 1987 detailed job cost report, the supporting subcontractor invoices, cancelled
checks, and F&D claim and payment records. (Tr. 58-64, 311-312, 849-854). The database captures
the detail of the cost report to the invoice level and contains data for approximately 205 invoices
identified by cost type, cost code, date of invoice, vender name, invoice amount, and description.
Ernst & Young found invoices and check carbons for all but approximately $5,700 detailed in
Beiro’s cost report as subcontractor costs. (Tr. 58-59). A number of Beiro’s subcontractors
submitted backup for their post-termination certified claims that independently admitted payments of
$2,316,628. (Tr. 790-805; AEX 450; AEX 470; AEX 471). The payments admitted by these
                                                 -7-                   A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



subcontractors matched the amounts recorded in the cost database and claimed by Appellants to
have been paid as subcontract payments. (AEX 470; AEX 471). We find that this corroboration
between payments admitted by subcontractors and payments identified in the Ernst & Young
database lends significant credibility to Ernst & Young’s cost databases and the underlying Beiro
cost records. (Cf. Tr. 1385). The record separately supports F&D’s payments to subcontractors.
(Tr. 849-854; AEX 450).

        The District argues that $15,216 in payments to American Steel, G.M. Ketcham, Hope’s
Architectural, and Montgomery Elevator were part of Beiro’s payment requisitions 18 and 19, and
because the District never paid those requisitions, Beiro must not have actually paid these amounts.
We are not persuaded by the District’s argument. American Steel and G.M. Ketcham filed no claims
against Beiro, Hope’s Architectural confirmed all Beiro payments, and Montgomery Elevator made
a claim for only $434. (AEX 408, at 52; AEX 450; AEX 471). The subcontractor confirmations of
payment lead us to find that Ernst & Young’s database schedules derived from the October 1987
detailed job cost report accurately reflect actual costs incurred by Beiro. Accordingly, we find that it
is more likely than not that these challenged payments were indeed made.

       The District also argues that of 29 invoices from Maurice Electrical Supply Company, only 7
were stamped “paid” and only 15 were marked with the initials of the Beiro project manager. (AEX
443). The District further claims that 3 amounts on the database listing are not supported by
invoices. Having reviewed the invoices in AEX 443 and those attached to the original requisitions
submitted by Beiro to the District, as well as the cost schedule, and the testimony, we find that the
record adequately supports Beiro direct payments to Maurice Electrical amounting to $187,469.

       The District also challenges the support for payments made by Beiro to LeBow and to
Hallmark Iron Works. We find that the payments are adequately supported by the record. (AEX
442; Beiro’s original payment requisitions; AEX 236, at 50; AEX 440; AEX 450; AEX 471).

        Finally, the District argues that F&D’s payments to subcontractors BPI, Beautyguard, Able
Equipment, Colorado Security Agency, and RRA, in settlement of claims, was done without the
approval of the contracting officer as required by contract. We find that the District has not shown
that the payments were in excess of a reasonable amount for the subcontracted services provided to
Beiro on the project. (Tr. 849-54; AEX 236, at 35; AEX 450). The District suffered no prejudice
from these settlements.

       We find that the record adequately supports subcontractor costs paid by Beiro of $4,082,213.

               4. Subcontractor Claims

       Appellants seek subcontractor claims totaling $1,488,560. (AEX 458, at.35; AEX 450; Tr.
141). The subcontractors variously claim unpaid progress payments, unpaid change order work,
withheld retention, and indirect costs as part of their termination for convenience claims. (Tr. 760-
61; AEX 450; DEX 270). As described in more detail below, we find entitlement for these
subcontractor claims in the total amount of $168,954, plus interest as described in Section C. infra.
                                               -8-                  A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822




               A.G. Mauro Company

        Appellants presented a proof of claim form and a Beiro audit sheet in support of a $3,700
claim by A.G. Mauro Company apparently for unpaid invoices for furnishing builders’ hardware.
(Tr. 763; AEX 450 (A.G. Mauro tab)). Because the record documentation is inadequate to support
the claim, we deny the claim.

               Beautyguard Exterior Systems, Inc.

        Beautyguard filed a claim for $32,025 (excluding interest), for furnishing and installing
exterior metal siding as part of its subcontract with Beiro. (Tr. 264-286). F&D paid Beautyguard
$5,000 pursuant to a pass-through agreement, leaving the unpaid claim amount at $27,025. (Tr. 277-
78; AEX 458, at 35; AEX 450 (Beautyguard tab)). The $32,025 claim was composed of $14,979 for
unpaid contract work, $1,581 for extra engineering work, and $15,465 for extended overhead costs.
(Tr. 269-78; AEX 450). Based on our review of the testimony from Mr. Speiden, president of
Beautyguard, we find entitlement to the $14,979 for unpaid contract work and $250 for extra
redesign and engineering work, a total of $15,229. Beautyguard did not demonstrate that the District
was responsible for critical path delays to its performance. Moreover, the schedule information did
not clearly identify Beautyguard’s planned performance period and we are not convinced that any
alleged delays prevented Beautyguard from taking on other work. Therefore, we deny
Beautyguard’s claim for extended overhead costs. Because F&D previously paid Beautyguard
$5,000 on its claim, we sustain the claim in the amount $10,229 plus interest on that amount as
indicated in Section C. infra.

               Beta Construction Company

        Beta Construction submitted a termination for convenience claim in the amount of $9,061 for
its basement waterproofing work on the project. (Tr. 764; AEX 450 (Beta Construction tab)). The
claim amount consists of $699 for unpaid labor and materials and $8,362 for home office overhead.
The overhead claim is unsupported. We sustain Beta Construction’s claim in the amount of $699
plus interest on that amount as indicated in Section C. infra.

               BPI Mechanical, Inc.

        BPI performed all the mechanical work for Beiro and obtained a court judgment against
Appellants for its termination for convenience claim in the amount of $644,793. (Tr. 765-66; AEX
450 (BPI Mechanical tab)). During an appeal of that judgment, the Appellants and BPI settled their
dispute, with F&D paying $540,000 directly to BPI under a pass-through agreement by which the
parties agreed to submit the entire claim to the District. (Tr. 849-50; AEX 450). The F&D payment
reduced the unpaid claim amount to $104,793. (AEX 458, at 35). Having reviewed the record,
including the documentation submitted by BPI and its subcontractors, we are unable to find adequate
support entitling BPI to recover any amounts beyond the $540,000 previously paid.
                                                -9-                  A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



               Fairfax Glass Company, Inc.

       Fairfax Glass submitted a claim of $6,940 for supplying insulating glass for the project on
February 17, 1986. We sustain the claimed cost of materials in the amount of $5,164 plus interest on
that amount as described in Section C. infra, but find the remaining claimed amounts for labor,
overhead, and legal fees to be unsupported. (Tr. 766; AEX 450 (Fairfax Glass tab)).

               Fib-Con Corporation

        Fib-Con submitted a claim of $108 for drafting submittals for custom fiberglass planters. We
sustain the claim plus interest on that amount as indicated in Section C. infra. (Tr. 766-67; AEX 450
(Fib-Con tab)).

               Flowers School Equipment Company, Inc.

       Flowers School Equipment submitted a claim by its gymnasium equipment supplier, Aalco
Manufacturing Company, in the amount of $735 for Aalco’s shop drawings and freight expenses.
We sustain the claim plus interest on that amount as indicated in Section C. infra. (Tr. 767-68; AEX
450 (Flowers School Equip. tab)).

               Louis J. Grasmick Lumber Company, Inc.

        Grasmick Lumber submitted a claim in the amount of $41,455, before interest, for half inch
and five-eighth inch plywood furnished to the project. (Tr. 768; AEX 450 (Grasmick Lumber tab)).
The statement of claim seeks $40,694 for the plywood, hauling and labor charges of $761, and
interest amounts. However, Mr. Grant Grasmick’s statement of claim indicates that the plywood
was shipped to the jobsite on February 24 and 26, 1986, and March 6, 1986, thus several days before
and after the District’s February 28, 1986 stop work order. The statement of claim also indicates
that Grasmick removed all of the plywood from the jobsite at the request of Beiro. Indeed, $450 of
the $761 is for “Hauling charge for removing and returning material from Washington to
Baltimore.” (AEX 450 (Grasmick tab, at 2)). Accordingly, we deny the material portion of the
claim amounting to $40,694, but sustain the hauling and labor charges of $761 plus interest on that
amount as indicated in Section C. infra.

               Greensteel Division, Adience Company, L.P.

        Greensteel submitted a termination for convenience claim pertaining to its school equipment
contract in the amount of $6,927. (AEX 450 (Greensteel tab)). It does not appear that Greensteel
furnished any equipment to the job. Although part of the claim appears to be for shop drawing
preparation, the record does not adequately support what those costs amounted to and how they were
calculated. Because the remaining claimed costs are not adequately supported, we deny the entire
claim. (Tr. 768-69; AEX 450).

               Greenwald Industrial Products Company, Inc.
                                                - 10 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822




         Greenwald submitted a termination for convenience claim for its bathroom partition contract,
in the total amount of $8,449, composed of $5,633 for “engineering and administrative expenses” of
Greenwald’s sub-supplier, Penco Products, Greenwald’s own administrative costs of $2,516, and
$300 for claim preparation. (Tr. 769-70; AEX 450 (Greenwald Industrial tab)). We deny the claim
because the amounts are not adequately supported.

               Hallmark Iron Works, Inc.

        Hallmark Iron was the miscellaneous metals subcontractor for the project which included
furnishing and installing iron frames, pipe rails, steel stairways. (Tr. 549, 770). Hallmark submitted
a termination for convenience claim in the amount of $174,913. (Tr. 550; AEX 450 (Hallmark Iron
Works tab)). Hallmark’s own claimed costs consist of $90,492 for materials, shop labor of $22,159,
tools and supplies of $2,715, supervision costs of $665, delivery costs of $752, field labor costs of
$38,960, and shop drawings of $4,304. Hallmark also seeks $36,976 for wire mesh supplied by the
G-S Company, and subcontracted field labor of $21,100, composed of $8,100 for Wright Erection
and $13,000 for Metro Steel & Stone. (AEX 450). Mr. Ralph Barnes, Hallmark’s senior project
manager, testified in support of Hallmark’s claim and explained the supporting documentation. (Tr.
552-69).

        We were able to locate in the record a number of invoices of Hallmark for the period from
October 1984 through June 1985. In addition, the subcontractor costs database in Schedule 4 of
Beiro’s original claim submission (AEX 236) shows that Hallmark received subcontract payments
through September 30, 1985. Based on our review of the Hallmark invoices found in AEX 440,
Schedule 4 subcontract costs data of payments to Hallmark, and Hallmark’s certified claim, we find
that the invoices and the Schedule 4 payments provide a more reliable record of Hallmark’s costs
than the statement of costs listed in Hallmark’s certified claim. Several of the Hallmark invoices can
be tied into the subcontractor costs for Hallmark found in Schedule 4 of Appellants’ original claim
submission and may be compared to the costs claimed by Hallmark in its March 1988 certified
claim. (AEX 236, at 50). For example, Schedule 4 shows a payment by Beiro on January 28, 1985,
in the amount of $12,754, and described as “Req. 4 – Prevocational.” That can be tied to Hallmark
Requisition No. 4211-03-12 (1984), dated December 20, 1984, in the net amount of $12,754.
Although the requisition has typed matter indicating that the period of the requisition is from
November 20 to December 20, 1984, the supporting invoices are dated October 20, November 20,
and December 20, 1984. (AEX 440, at Bates 602571-602568). The October 20, 1984 invoice bills
for fabricated Items 8E/D, 9E/D, and 10E/D in the total amount of $372. In contrast, Hallmark’s
certified claim asserts that its materials only cost for Items 8E, 9E, 10D, and 10E amount to $1,778.
(AEX 450 (Hallmark tab, at 7-8)). In addition, Hallmark seeks in its certified claim a portion of its
claimed $22,159 in shop labor for fabrication of these items as well as erection costs of $1,400 for
Items 8E and 9E. (Id. at 3, 5). We find it more likely than not that Hallmark’s invoice billed for all
associated costs, including material, shop labor, and field labor.

      Hallmark’s January 20, 1985 invoice bills for Items 30E/D, 10D, 27E/D, and 27D, in the
amount of $3,704, which reduces to $3,333 after deducting a 10 percent retention. That amount ties
                                                - 11 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



to the $3,333 payment found in Schedule 4. In contrast, the certified claim identifies an amount of
$987 for Item 30D and $10,096 for Item 30E. In sum, it is impossible from the meager information
in the certified claim to adopt the cost figures set out on the material worksheet. The large amounts
in the certified claim for shop labor and field labor are similarly without adequate documentation to
support them. As stated above, we believe it is more likely than not that Hallmark’s invoices which
were paid by Beiro included all associated job costs, including material, shop labor, and field labor.
Because the record shows that Hallmark received its last payment from Beiro on approximately
September 30, 1985, and there is no indication that Hallmark had failed to invoice Beiro or receive
payment from Beiro for any of its work performed prior to that date, we find that Hallmark received
appropriate compensation for its performance through approximately August 1985.

       We find Hallmark’s certified claim for $21,100 for its subcontracted field labor by Wright
Erection and Metro Steel & Stone to be included in the subcontract costs that Beiro previously paid
to Hallmark. The dates for those subcontracted erection items suggest performance prior to August
1985. Hallmark did not include invoices or payment records showing that such work was not
included in the payments Beiro made to Hallmark during 1985. Therefore, it must bear
responsibility for any failure in the evidence.

        Some of Hallmark’s material items appear to have been manufactured and perhaps installed
at the job site after August 1985. These amounts would not have been included in the payments
made by Beiro to Hallmark. Having reviewed Hallmark’s material worksheet for material items
which have building material dates after August 1985, we find Hallmark entitled to recover costs
amounting to $22,755. Because Hallmark did not introduce evidence of any allocable shop or field
labor on these items, we are unable to award such costs. Adding 10 percent overhead and 10 percent
profit, we find Hallmark entitled to recover $27,534. Thus, Hallmark’s claims for shop labor, tools
and supplies, supervision, delivery, field labor, and shop drawings are denied for lack of adequate
support.

        The final issue to be dealt with on Hallmark’s certified claim is the claim component labeled
“supplier material” submitted on behalf of the G-S Company, consisting of $26,144 for materials,
$1,960 for labor, and $8,872 for delay costs. (AEX 450 (Hallmark tab)). We deny G-S Company’s
material cost portion because the stainless steel mesh was never delivered to the site. The mesh was
not simply scrap, and thus had some value. (Tr. 558-59). In addition, G-S may have been able to
use the wire mesh on another job or return it to the manufacturer without sustaining any loss.
Because G-S does not indicate the disposition of the mesh, we are unable to find entitlement. G-S
claims 56 labor hours for drafting/engineering time and field measuring time. Because there is no
indication as to what efforts were accomplished, we are unable to find entitlement to labor costs.
We deny the delay costs of $8,872 because G-S has not shown either a critical path delay in its
performance caused by the District or that any such delay prevented it from taking on other work
during the delay period. In sum, G-S Company’s claim is denied.

      Accordingly, Hallmark’s claim is supported in the amount of $27,534, plus interest on that
amount as indicated in Section C. infra.

               Herndon Lumber & Millwork

       Herndon Lumber & Millwork was the millwork subcontractor responsible for fabricating
millwork, cabinets and countertops. (Tr. 770-71). Herndon Lumber submitted a termination for
convenience claim for shop drawings, estimates and administrative costs in the amount of $3,220.
(AEX 450 (Herndon Lumber tab)). We find adequate support in the record for the claimed costs for
shop drawings in the amount of $902, plus interest on that amount as indicated in Section C. infra.

               Hope’s Architectural Products, Inc.

        Hope’s Architectural Products, Inc., was a subcontractor for steel window frames and
submitted a claim in the amount of $11,300, before interest, for unpaid retention ($3,499), and extra
work under PCO 185 ($5,297), PCO 197 ($1,795), PCO 26 ($479), and PCO 151 ($230). (Tr. 771;
AEX 450 (Hope’s Architectural Products tab)). We sustain the claim for unpaid retention in the
amount of $3,499. The claim for acceleration identified as PCO 185 is denied for lack of adequate
support. We deny the claim based on PCO 197 (insulated porcelain panels) because neither Hope
nor Beiro has shown that the need for custom design and fabrication of the insulated panels was the
result of a post-award change to the specifications and drawings. We sustain the $479 claimed by
Hope for PCO 26 which the District does not dispute. (DEX 231). Finally, we sustain the $230
claimed by Hope for extra work involved in trimming sash to fit a revised masonry. Accordingly,
Hope is entitled to $4,208 plus interest as indicated in Section C. infra.

               Industrial Machinery Equipment Corporation

         Industrial Machinery submitted a claim for freight, return freight, and restocking of an
emergency generator in the amount of $4,695. (Tr. 771-73; AEX 450 (Industrial Machinery tab)).
We find that the 25 percent restocking charge is excessive under the circumstances and we reduce
that portion of the claim from $4,000 to $1,600 reflecting a 10 percent charge. Thus, we sustain the
total claim in the amount of $2,290 plus interest as indicated in Section C. infra.

               J.A. Nearing Company, Inc.

        J.A. Nearing Company was the greenhouse subcontractor. (Tr. 773). It submitted a revised
termination for convenience claim in the amount of $6,859 for shop drawings and packing list labor
($1,594), 1,400 square feet of 1/4 inch clear wire glass ($3,850), and storage costs ($792). (AEX
450 (J.A. Nearing tab)). We sustain the labor amount of $1,594 but deny the material cost because
J.A. Nearing made no showing that it was unable to recover its costs for the material by resale or
return to the supplier. Similarly, we deny the storage costs because the claim that material was
stored for 34 months is unsupported by the record. Thus, J.A. Nearing is entitled to $1,594 plus
interest as indicated in Section C. infra.

               John H. Hampshire, Inc.

       The spray-applied fireproofing subcontractor, John H. Hampshire, Inc., submitted a claim in
                                                - 13 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



the amount of $14,583 for the balance due on its work and minor changes. (Tr. 774; AEX 450 (John
Hampshire tab)). The documentation submitted by Hampshire is inadequate to demonstrate that it
completed its base contract work as well as change order work. Accordingly, we deny its claim.

               Long Fence Company, Inc.

        Long Fence submitted a certified termination for convenience claim in the amount of $733
for work performed on its exterior play equipment subcontract. (Tr. 774-75; AEX 450 (Long Fence
tab)). Long Fence’s documentation adequately supports $120 for shop drawing labor, plus interest
as indicated in Section C. infra.

               Lynn Fabricators, Inc.

        Lynn Fabricators was the structural steel subcontractor. Lynn submitted a cost proposal on
December 8, 1987, asserting claimed costs of $316,992, consisting of steel price escalation ($8,725),
extra material costs arising from changes ($19,612), extra costs by Lynn’s detailer arising from
changes ($48,500), extra costs incurred by Lynn’s joist and deck supplier due to changes ($16,296),
extra erector costs incurred by the erector due to changes ($52,016), Lynn’s extended overhead due
to delays ($103,168), settlement costs ($23,250), unpaid contract balance ($16,607), and overhead
and profit ($28,818). Although we do not doubt that Lynn and its supplier and subcontractors
incurred some additional costs as a result of one or more of the changes outlined in the 15-page
narrative of Lynn’s claim summary document, there is simply insufficient evidence in the record to
support the magnitude of the claimed costs. The claim summary in AEX 450 lacks all of its
referenced exhibits. Lynn supplied no costs records other than the one-page letter of December 8,
1987, listing the categories of costs, and a one-page “Cost Analysis Summary” dated January 27,
1986, which like the December 8, 1987 letter, provides only a top-level summary of costs. The only
supporting testimony, short and superficial, was offered by Beiro’s Mr. Murray. (Tr. 775-76).
Accordingly, we deny the claim of Lynn Fabricators.

               Mid-Atlantic Steel Contractors, Inc.

        Mid-Atlantic Steel was the rebar subcontractor. (Tr. 779). It submitted a termination for
convenience claim in the amount of $25,285, consisting of claims for overhead and profit on direct
labor as well as labor inefficiency ($9,126) and extended overhead ($8,141). (AEX 450 (Mid-
Atlantic tab)). We sustain Mid-Atlantic’s claim for overhead and profit on its supported burdened
labor costs of $32,303, in the amounts of $3,230 (10 percent overhead) and $3,553 (10 percent
profit). Mid-Atlantic’s labor inefficiency claim has merit and we find that it is entitled to
compensation of an additional $2,563 based on the difference between the planned rate of 1.05 tons
of rebar installed per man-day and its actual average rate of 0.9 tons per man-day. In calculating the
inefficiency amount (189 hours), we used the labor hour totals and costs set forth in Mid-Atlantic’s
final labor statement. We deny Mid-Atlantic’s extended overhead claim for lack of adequate
support. Accordingly, Mid-Atlantic is entitled to recover $9,346 plus interest as indicated in Section
C. infra.
                                               - 14 -               A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



               Montgomery Elevator Company

       Montgomery Elevator submitted a claim in the amount of $434 for its unpaid contract
balance. (Tr. 779; AEX 450 Montgomery Elevator tab)). Based on our review of the invoices and
payments made to Montgomery Elevator, we sustain the claim for $434 plus interest as indicated in
Section C. infra. (AEX 236, at 51).

               Overhead Door Company of North Washington

        Overhead Door submitted a termination for convenience claim in the amount of $1,995 for
shop drawings and administrative costs. (Tr. 779-80; AEX 450 (Overhead Door tab)). The shop
drawing costs are supported by an invoice but the administrative costs are not adequately supported
by the record. Accordingly, we find Overhead Door entitled to $91 plus interest as indicated in
Section C. infra.

               R. Bratti Associates, Inc.

        R. Bratti Associates was the masonry subcontractor. Its subcontract with Beiro was in the
amount of $696,000. Change orders increased the price by $66,536 for a adjusted contract price of
$762,536. The record contains a July 17, 1986 requisition of R. Bratti valuing its completed work in
the amount of $598,361, or approximately 78 percent completion. That requisition shows Beiro
payments of $518,751, with an amount due of $79,610 plus an additional $3,620 for six items of
extra work billed on a time and materials basis. (AEX 450 (R. Bratti tab)). The value of
performance, change order amounts, and time and materials costs are supported by documentation
submitted by R. Bratti. In a March 9, 1988 certified claim, R. Bratti sought total performance costs
of $606,830, $51,691 for office overhead and administrative costs, and 15 percent profit of $98,778,
for a total of $757,299. After deducting payments received from Beiro of $518,751, R. Bratti
arrived at a balance due of $238,548. Mr. Ronald Bratti testified at the hearing in support of the
claim. (Tr. 520-547). The masonry work was substantially impacted by the changes to the structural
drawings, which were not coordinated by the District with the architectural drawings controlling the
exterior masonry. (Tr. 522-23). R. Bratti Associates submitted a certified termination for
convenience claim in the amount of $238,548. (Tr. 535; AEX 450 (R. Bratti tab); Tr. 78). Having
reviewed the record, we find that the July 17, 1986 requisition is a more reliable statement of R.
Bratti’s costs of performance than the March 9, 1988 claim. The March 1988 claim is supported
only by a one-page recap cost sheet which lacks the kind of supporting labor, material, and overhead
cost documentation we would expect for a claim of this size. Moreover, we believe that July 1986
requisition costs incorporated applicable overhead and profit. Accordingly, R. Bratti Associates is
entitled to $83,230 plus interest as indicated in Section C. infra.



               Ratrie, Robbins & Schweizer. Inc.

       Ratrie, Robbins & Schweizer (“RRS”) was Beiro’s paving subcontractor. (Tr. 782). On
                                                - 15 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



October 22, 1987, RRS submitted a termination for convenience claim in the amount of $7,204.
RRS states that it originally was to commence performance in Fall 1985 but its start date was
ultimately rescheduled to Fall 1986/Spring 1987. RRS did not actually perform any paving work on
the project because RRS’ revised start date was well after the February 28, 1986 contract suspension
date. On November 10, 1987, RRS supplemented its claim, stating that it was unable to absorb the
$7,204 of overhead costs arising from the extensive delays to its beginning work. (AEX 450 (RRS
tab)). We are not persuaded by the meager record that RRS was unable to replace this anticipated
job with other work. Nor has RRS provided adequate evidence of any direct costs of its preliminary
efforts such as for material submittals and field work preparation. Accordingly, we find that RRS
has not shown that it is entitled to recover for either direct or indirect costs.

               Southeastern Floor Company, Inc.

        Southeastern Floor submitted a termination for convenience claim in the amount of $1,080
for the costs of purchasing and storing special order flooring. (Tr. 782; AEX 450 (Southeastern
Floor tab)). However, Southeastern Floor did not submit any invoice or receipt evidencing its
payment for the flooring. We deny the claim for lack of adequate support.

               Stevens Tile & Marble Company, Inc.

        Stevens Tile & Marble was the ceramic tile subcontractor. (Tr. 783). It submitted a claim in
the amount of $2,751, before interest, for the unpaid costs of purchased materials delivered to the
project. (AEX 450 (Stevens Tile tab)). The claim is adequately supported by invoice
documentation. Stevens Tile is entitled to $2,751 plus interest as indicated in Section C. infra.

               Superior Electric Company, Inc.

         Superior Electric performed work on the Prevocational Facility, which included installing the
initial power hookup, placing conduit for concrete slabs, and placing conduit in masonry and drywall
until the District suspended work in February 1986. (Tr. 784-85). The permanent wiring, electrical
fixtures, panels, and an emergency generator had not been installed by the time of the work
suspension. (Tr. 785-88). Superior Electric was a small company for which the Prevocational
Facility may have been its sole job at the time. (Tr. 788). On November 9, 1987, it submitted a
certified claim totaling $443,301 for administrative and overhead costs, “opportunity costs lost due
to restriction on bonding”, and taxes. (AEX 450 (Superior Electric tab)). We find that none of the
claimed costs are supported and none are recoverable. Beiro’s Mr. Murray testified that Superior
Electric also was owed money for unpaid progress payments, unpaid retention, and unpaid changes.
(Tr. 1476-81). However, Superior Electric made no claim for such amounts and there are no
supporting requisitions or invoices. Accordingly, we deny Superior Electric’s claim and Beiro’s
claim on behalf of Superior Electric.

exterior of the Prevocational Facility. (Tr. 788-89; AEX 450 (Triangle tab)). It submitted a claim
for unpaid invoices in the amount of $17,978. (AEX 450; AEX 458, at 35). We find the claim to be
adequately supported by invoices and cost records. Accordingly, we sustain the claim in the amount
of $17,978 plus interest as indicated in Section C. infra.

               Wilcox Caulking Corporation

        Wilcox Caulking was the exterior joint sealant subcontractor. (Tr. 789). It submitted a
certified claim for work performed and contract administration costs in the amount of $7,500,
consisting of $5,000 for labor and materials and $2,500 for “administrative and estimating costs and
expenses.” (AEX 450 (Wilcox Caulking tab)). Payroll records submitted by Wilcox only support
labor costs of $780 for the payroll periods December 19 - 25, 1985, and December 26, 1985 -
January 1, 1986. There is no support for its material costs or its administrative and estimating costs.
Accordingly, we find Wilcox entitled to recover $780 plus interest as indicated in Section C. infra.

               5. Owned Equipment

       Ernst & Young prepared a schedule of costs incurred by Beiro for using its own equipment
on the project. (AEX 458, Schedule 5). Schedule 5 is divided into two categories of owned
equipment costs: pre-suspension equipment costs, covering the period from May 1984 through
April 1986 (approximately two months beyond the February 1986 stop work order), amounting to
$386,465, and post-suspension equipment costs of $175,074, for a claim total of $561,539. (AEX
458, Schedule 5; Tr. 73, 76).

        To determine owned equipment costs, Ernst & Young used Beiro’s equipment listing by
location reports (AEX 447) and the project’s daily job reports (AEX 208). (Tr. 65, 312; AEX 458,
at 7). The equipment list location reports were used to determine what equipment was on the project
site. (Tr. 65-67, 69, 499-501; AEX 447; AEX 458, at 7). The daily job reports then were consulted
to ascertain whether the heavy equipment was active or idle each day. (Tr. 67, 502-03; AEX 458, at
7). Ernst & Young determined that the heavy equipment was active 12.26 percent of the total job
time. (Tr. 71-72). Because the smaller equipment was not listed on the daily job reports, Ernst &
Young estimated its active time using the 12.26 percent usage factor for the heavy equipment. (Tr.
71-73).

        Ernst & Young used the relevant equipment rates whenever possible from the Associated
Equipment Distributors (“AED”) rental cost guide, which the District agrees is the proper rental cost
guide. (Tr. 65-66, 69-70; Tr. 754-55). Other equipment rate guides were used only to obtain rates
for equipment not identified in the AED guide. (Tr. 69-70). For calculating the cost for the
equipment, Ernst & Young multiplied the full AED rate by the number of days each piece of
equipment was actively used and multiplied 50 percent of the AED rate by the number of days that
each piece of equipment was idle. (Tr. 65-66, 73; AEX 458, at 7). For the post-suspension period,
all equipment was deemed idle. (Tr. 74-76).

       The District’s auditor admitted that he had no disagreement with the method used to
                                               - 17 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



calculate the owned equipment costs. (Tr. 1415). His concerns focused on whether the equipment
was actually at the job site and whether the equipment was necessary for the project. (Tr. 1415-16).
 Although the auditor had access to the underlying documentation for the equipment costs (Schedule
5, the Beiro equipment reports, and the daily project reports) he apparently did not substantively
analyze them or interview DPW personnel concerning what equipment was appropriate for the
project. (Tr. 1415-20).

        We have reviewed the documentation and the testimony and find the pre-suspension owned
heavy equipment costs to be supported with two exceptions. In our earlier discussion concerning
material and rental costs we found that equipment item T286 (“Transit”) was erroneously included
on Schedule 5 and thus the amount of $1,232 should be removed. (AEX 236, Schedule 5, at 58). In
their posthearing brief, Appellants also agree that the dates of service of the CAT 955L Loader (item
L2 of Schedule 5, at 58) should be reduced by 28 idle days representing a $2,978 reduction in cost
because the equipment did not arrive at the site until September 21, 1984. (Appellants’ Reply, at 12-
13; AEX 208, at 507758, 507782, 507835, 502214). These deductions total $4,210, which reduces
the pre-suspension heavy owned equipment costs to $261,916. We have carefully reviewed the
District’s arguments concerning heavy equipment on Schedule 5 listed as never being in active use.
However, a review of the daily project reports show that the equipment, such as tampers and rollers,
were often in use. Moreover, we find that some of this equipment (such as compressors and heaters)
would not likely be mentioned on the daily reports since they operate in the “background.” Ernst &
Young properly took a conservative approach in treating these items as always idle even though they
were undoubtedly in active use during at least some periods of the work.

        For the pre-suspension smaller equipment, we cannot agree with the method for computing
the owned equipment costs. Applying daily rates over extended periods of time on the job produced
what we consider to be excessive costs that in many cases far exceeded the purchase price of the
tools. Of the $120,339 sought by Appellants, we find $40,000 to be a reasonable owned equipment
cost which is approximately 5 percent of Beiro’s direct labor cost. Thus, Appellants’ pre-suspension
equipment costs equal $301,916, consisting of $261,916 for heavy equipment and $40,000 for the
smaller equipment.

        For the post-suspension costs, covering the period May 1986 through August 1987, we
generally find the costs to be unallowable. Although Beiro reasonably might have maintained some
of the equipment on the job site after the stop work in February 1986, by the time the stop work was
converted to a suspension on April 23, 1986, a reasonable contractor would have removed
construction equipment from the job site for use on other jobs as needed. The fact that Beiro left so
much construction equipment on the site for so long indicates, we believe, that there simply was no
other Beiro job requiring the equipment, especially since Beiro had lost its bonding capacity and was
winding down. (Tr. 75). The District should not be expected to reimburse Beiro for storing
unneeded equipment at the job site. One exception to our disallowance is the cost associated with
maintaining Beiro’s office trailers ($10,996), storage trailers ($23,758), and some limited pieces of
equipment for loading and moving operations ($2,000) until the default termination. It was
reasonable for Beiro to maintain these items at the site for conducting post-suspension project
meetings and negotiations and in support of securing the site. Accordingly, we allow $36,754 for
                                               - 18 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



such costs but disallow the remainder of the post-suspension costs in the amount of $138,320.

       In sum, we find Appellants are entitled to $338,670 in owned equipment costs.

               6. Unabsorbed General and Administrative Costs

        Appellants claim $377,760 for unabsorbed overhead costs during the 518-day District-
imposed suspension of work from February 28, 1986 to July 31, 1987. (AEX 458, at 37). Appellants
argue that they are entitled to unabsorbed overhead costs for this period because the District-
imposed suspension of work resulted in a suspension of Beiro’s bonding capacity. (Tr. 833-34; Tr.
665). According to Appellants, F&D, as surety, was particularly concerned about the Prevocational
Facility contract as evidenced by the segregation of information about the Prevocational Facility
contract from the information about all Beiro’s other contracts in the financial and contract
information sheets prepared for F&D in 1986 and 1987. (Tr. 836-37; AEX 415, 418; DEX 221).
During this period, the District also was withholding over 2 million dollars in payments due Beiro on
the Benning Terrace and Air Rights Tunnel projects. (Tr. 886-91; Tr. 1493-95; DEX 225, at 935,
939-40).

        In 1981, Beiro had approximately $20 million in assets, $35 million in contract earnings,
gross profit from contracts of $5 million, and net income of $1.72 million. In 1982, Beiro had
approximately $15 million in assets, $21 million in contract earnings, gross profit from contracts of
$2.28 million, and a net loss of $543,000. In 1983, Beiro had approximately $11 million in assets,
$10 million in contract earnings, gross profit from contracts of $1 million, and net income of
$862,000. Beiro had losses from its investments in oil producing equipment and real estate of $1.3
million and $1.6 million for 1982 and 1983 respectively. (AEX 402). In 1984, Beiro had
approximately $16 million in assets, $31 million in contract earnings, gross profit from contracts of
$2.4 million, and a net loss of $155,000. (AEX 403-404). In 1985, Beiro had approximately $12
million in assets, $44.7 million in contract earnings, gross profit from contracts of $777,000, and a
net loss of $4.6 million. (AEX 404). Working capital increased by $1.3 million in 1981, was
unchanged in 1982, increased by $1.6 million in 1983, decreased by $430,000 in 1984, and
decreased by $5 million in 1985.

        Up until 1984, Beiro had a bonding capacity of approximately $100 million. (Tr. 833-34;
AEX 401-402). In 1984, or perhaps in early 1985, Beiro’s bonding capacity dropped to $20 million.
 (Tr. 833-34). F&D’s counsel testified that F&D suspended Beiro’s bonding capacity entirely in
“late ’85 or early ’86.” (Tr. 833-34). We find it more likely than not that F&D suspended Beiro’s
bonding capacity in 1985. F&D noticed a significant increase in Beiro claims on a wide array of its
bonded projects. (Tr. 830-31). In early 1985, F&D hired a construction consultant, an accounting
firm, and a law firm to investigate Beiro’s contract performance and financial and legal situation.
The investigation revealed that Beiro’s financial position had eroded substantially in the space of
approximately a year and a half to two years. (Tr. 831-32). F&D’s counsel testified that the reasons
for the eroded financial position were slow pay by owners on construction projects, Beiro’s
prosecuting many claims (with the attendant costs) but not getting paid on claims or change orders,
and a loss of working capital on account business losses including significant loans made to a
                                                - 19 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



struggling affiliated company, Beiro Concrete. (Tr. 832; AEX 402-404). A review of financial
statements covering 1984 and 1985 shows that Beiro’s working capital reserves were being depleted
even before 1985 through significant losses not only on contracts but also on real estate and oil
investments, a large dividend, and interest expenses. (AEX 403). Thus, the weakening financial
position of Beiro left it unable to absorb the severe revenue declines in 1985. In a February 21, 1986
draft financial statement for 1985, a note reads:

       The Company has been informed by their Surety of their decision not to provide
       performance bonds on future construction contracts. Their decision was based on the
       financial condition of the Company as evaluated by the Surety. The inability to post
       performance bonds has therefore restrained the Company from bidding on future
       construction contracts with bonding requirements.

(AEX 404, Note 1 to Financial Statements). By the time the District stopped paying Beiro’s
requisitions beginning with Requisition No. 18 submitted by Beiro on January 31, 1986 (AEX 60),
and rejected by District letter of March 10, 1986 (AEX 71, 72, 87), and issued the stop work order
on February 28, 1986, Beiro had already lost its bonding capacity. Thus, the District’s suspension of
work on the Prevocational job was not the proximate cause of Beiro’s inability to obtain other
bonded work during the delay period but rather a further impediment to financial recovery. On these
facts, we do not find the District liable for Beiro’s unabsorbed overhead during the suspension
period.

               7. Overhead Mark-Up

       Ernst & Young determined Beiro’s overhead mark-up to be 10.62 percent on direct costs of
$7,613,845. (Tr. 80-81; AEX 458, at 37). As we stated in our discussion of Beiro’s claim for
material, equipment rental, and direct general costs supra, we exclude from Beiro’s G&A rate the
category of indirect costs labeled on the financial statements as “Repairs, maintenance and
operations of automotive and contracting equipment, including indirect labor” so as to avoid any
potential duplication of costs. Appellant’s overhead mark-up was a composite of its overhead rates
for 1984-1987. The problem with Ernst & Young’s calculations is that the 1987 rate is nearly 50
percent and does not represent a proper component for the calculations since most of the direct costs
were incurred in 1984 and 1985. By 1987, Beiro had essentially ceased its construction business.
We find a G&A rate of 10 percent to be a reasonable rate. Accordingly, Appellants are entitled to
overhead costs in the amount of $629,424 on direct costs totaling $6,294,239.

               8. Profit

       Ernst & Young included a ten percent profit factor. (Tr. 6; AEX 458, at 4; Tr. 1426). We
agree that a 10 percent profit factor is reasonable. The District has made no showing that there
would have been a loss on the contract. The fact that certain change orders and subcontractor costs
have not been sustained by us for lack of adequate quantum documentation does not change on profit
on this project. Applying a 10 percent rate to the $6,923,663 sum of Beiro’s direct costs of
$6,294,239 and overhead costs of $629,424, yields profit of $692,366.

       Total Unpaid Costs of Performance

        We find total unpaid costs of performance of $2,673,765 which is the difference between
total costs of performance of $7,954,699 and District payments to Beiro of $5,280,934. We
summarize the calculations as follows:

                      Labor                                         $ 790,285
                      Labor Burden                                  $ 238,020
                      Materials & Rental Equipment                  $1,014,767
                      Subcontractors                                $4,082,213
                             Subtotal                               $6,125,285

                      Profit (10%)                                  $ 692,366

                      Unpaid Costs of Performance                   $2,673,765

       B. Settlement and Claim Preparation Costs

        Ernst & Young initially calculated Appellants’ settlement and claim preparation costs at
$115,721. (AEX 236, at 74; AEX 458, at 39). This calculation inadvertently omitted an invoice
from Ernst & Young for claim preparation in the amount of $15,283 submitted after the settlement
proposal was finalized. (Tr. 86-87; AEX 431 (invoice dated November 27, 1991)). Appellants seek
settlement and claim preparation costs of $131,004, consisting of $72,798 paid by F&D to Ernst &
Young to prepare the settlement proposal (Tr. 84-88; Tr. 855), $6,506 paid by F&D to the law firm
of Watt, Tieder, Killian & Hoffar in connection with the preparation of the settlement proposal,
$47,595 paid in connection with the defense and settlement of the post-termination claim of BPI
Mechanical (Tr. 82-83; Tr. 855-57, 859-60; AEX 434), and $4,105 paid by F&D to the law firm of
Whiteford, Taylor & Preston in connection with the defense and settlement of claims by Able
Equipment and another subcontractor (Tr. 857-60; AEX 458, at 39; AEX 450 (Able Equipment
tab)). The District does not challenge the reasonableness of the fees. We sustain Appellants’ claim
for claim preparation costs amounting to $131,004.

       C. Interest
                                               - 21 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



        Appellants seek two types of interest: interest on funds advanced by F&D to Beiro in
support of the Prevocational project at the rate set by their loan agreement, and interest on unpaid
change orders from the date of the PCO proposal or settlement with the District. (AEX 458, at 41-
47). Alternatively, Appellants seek statutory interest, pursuant to former section 806 of D.C. Law 6-
85 (formerly D.C. Code § 1-1188.6, amended and recodified as § 2-308.06), at a rate of 4 percent on
performance-related costs measured from the date that Appellants submitted their claim to the
Director of the Department of Administrative Services on August 28, 1987. For nonperformance-
related costs, such as claim preparation costs, Appellants seek interest from the date of their being
incurred.

        We believe the statutory rate provided by the Procurement Practices Act governs here.
Accordingly, Appellants are entitled to interest on their unpaid performance costs (limited to the
adjusted contract price cap) at 4 percent per annum from August 28, 1987, the date that the Director
received Appellants’ claim challenging the default termination action, until paid by the District.

Williams, CAB No. D-839, Sept. 30, 1996, 44 D.C. Reg. 6511, 6545. Appellants are entitled to
interest on the settlement expenses at 4 percent per annum from December 23, 1991, the date of the
last payment for such expenses.

       D. Adjusted Contract Price/Contract Cap Calculation

        The original contract price for the Prevocational School project was $8,098,000.00. (AEX
4). During the course of the project, the District issued 34 Basic Change Directives (“BCDs”)
directing changes to work under Article 3 of the contract. (Tr. 456). The District also issued 13
Field Work Authorizations (“FWAs”) directing more minor changes to the work. In addition, Beiro
was also directed to perform extra work through verbal direction from District representatives,
correspondence from the District and/or its architect/engineer, or District responses to Beiro Notice
and Request forms. (Tr. 456). When verbal direction was given by District representatives, Beiro
would follow-up with a Notice and Request form confirming the direction. (Tr. 394-95).
Throughout the course of the project, Beiro submitted 120 Proposed Change Orders (“PCOs”) to the
District requesting equitable adjustments to the contract for extra work and delays. (AEX 238-357).

        In the Spring of 1987, when the District was contemplating re-start of the suspended project,
negotiations concerning Beiro's PCOs were conducted between Beiro and District representatives.
(Tr. 401-02, 458, 477; Tr. 5-8). Although only two formal change orders were executed, 48 PCOs
were settled by the parties. (Tr. 9-45). Mr. Kandikere Krishnamurthy, the District's expert witness
who reviewed the Beiro PCOs and testified by videotape, acknowledged entitlement for the PCOs
settled by the District representatives and quantum for the majority of the settled PCOs. (DEX 231).
Mr. Krishnamurthy recognized entitlement for 76 of the 120 Beiro PCOs. (DEX 231). Certain PCO
work was partially completed at the time of work suspension. Beiro has estimated the percentage of
work completed and applied the percentage in its contract cap calculation. (AEX 237; Tr. 458-59;
Tr. 47-49). The District did not rebut that evidence. According to Appellants, the PCO costs
incurred only by Beiro, including mark-ups on those costs, are $2,099,544.33. Appellants also claim
profit and bond markups on the subcontractor PCO costs of $70,380.93. Appellants presented
                                               - 22 -               A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



subcontractor termination for convenience claims totaling $1,488,560.00 (we have previously
determined entitlement amounting to $168,954). Appellants’ calculated adjusted contract cap is as
follows:

       Of Appellants’ claim for $2,099,544 in PCO costs, we find support for PCO costs totaling
$1,346,472, which includes the PCOs settled by the parties. The following is a discussion of each
PCO and our findings on entitlement and quantum.

       PCO 2

        The District's architect added reinforcing steel and concrete during its review of Beiro's
Transmittal No. 2 “Rebar Foundation” shop drawings. Beiro submitted its PCO 2 in the amount of
$1,483 for the additional work. After removing a 14.25 percent mark-up for FICA-FUTA (on top of
a labor burden rate of 27.41 percent), we sustain the claim in the amount of $1,427. (AEX 238,
AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 56-57)).

       PCO 3

        The District issued BCD No. 1 on August 7, 1984, making changes to the door schedule for
the project. Beiro submitted PCO 3, requesting compensation for this and other door revisions in the
amount of $14,435. As a result of the late changes to the doors, Beiro was forced to engage a
different hollow metal door supplier, at an additional cost of $8,246. The new supplier's products
also required additional field assembly and additional changes were required in the field to modify
door frames. (AEX 239; AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 60-62)). We find quantum to be $12,747.


       PCO 5

       The District’s architect made changes to the rebar layout for the first floor slab during the
                                               - 23 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



shop drawing phase. Beiro submitted its PCO 5 in the amount of $1,716 for the additional work.
The record does not support quantum. (AEX 240; AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 62-63)).

       PCO 6B

       The District issued BCD 2 on or about August 3, 1984, making a number of dimensional
changes to the architectural drawings. Beiro submitted its PCO 6B in the amount of $1,833 for the
extra work. Beiro and the District settled the PCO for the full amount, which we sustain. (AEX 241;
AEX 457 (McConnell Tr. 10-11); AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 63-65, 476-78)).

       PCO 7

       As a result of the District’s delay in establishing the layout/control points for the building
from July 9, 1984 until October 5, 1984, Beiro incurred additional direct costs for layout and
submitted PCO 7 in the amount of $17,229.00. We sustain the claim in the amount of $8,566.
(AEX 236, at 20; AEX 242, 245; Tr. 364-65).

       PCO 8

       Appellants withdrew PCO 8, in the amount of $32,149.00.

       PCO 9

        The District issued BCD No. 7 on or about November 2, 1984, making revisions to the water
meter vault for the Project. Beiro submitted a change order proposal in the amount of $1,728.00 for
the extra work. This change was subsequently settled with District representatives for $1,547.
(AEX 244; AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 11, 72-74)). We sustain the claim for that amount.

       PCO 10A and 10B (Beiro pre-suspension delay claims)

        Beginning before the July 9, 1984 Notice to Proceed, Beiro had identified dimensional
discrepancies between the structural and architectural drawings. (Tr. 363-66, 370; AEX 10, 19, 33).
 Design and dimensional problems caused by the District’s architect delayed major portions of the
work. (Tr. 368-70). The District issued numerous changes to the structural steel design to correct
the design errors. (E.g., AEX 241 (BCD No. 2); AEX 245 (BCD No. 4); AEX 246 (BCD No. 5);
AEX 75 (indicating that 69 percent of the structural steel members on the Project were changed)).
While Beiro waited inordinate lengths of time for the District to issue design resolutions, Beiro
reasonably slowed down its work on non-critical path activities so as to avoid a shutdown of work
on the site. (Tr. 379-80; 381-82; AEX 33). Beiro performed an analysis of the project delays and
determined that, as of the end of 1985, the project had been delayed 346 calendar days due to the
structural steel deficiencies. Mr. McConnell explained the delay analysis, using the baseline CPM
of November 1984 and the December 25, 1985 update, the last update in the record. (DEX 205, 206;
Tr. 383-85). Beiro submitted its PCOs for the pre-suspension delays under PCO 10A and 10B. (Tr.
385). In PCO 10A, Beiro attributed the first 90 days of delay to the architectural drawing changes
                                                  - 24 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



and the late provision of control points for the project, which prevented Beiro from performing the
initial critical layout and excavation/foundation work. (Tr. 363-65, 368-70, 385-86). Beiro
attributed the remaining 256 days of delay to the structural steel delays in PCO 10B. (Tr. 385-86;
AEX 246). With regard to the late provision of control points and architectural drawing changes, the
District agrees that CPM activity 895-900 (concrete column footings for sections 8 and 10) was
delayed by 56 days. (DEX 239, at 4). The District’s argument that Beiro made up the time on future
concrete pours is not persuasive. Based on our review of the schedules, updates, delay
correspondence, and testimony, we find that the late provision of control points for the project
critically delayed the project approximately 60 days. Based on our review of the record, we find that
Beiro was delayed approximately 210 days on account of the substantial structural steel redesign of
the project. Although the District’s expert proposed a total of 140 days of pre-suspension delay
(DEX 239, at 13), we believe the record supports at least 210 days of total critical path delay. Beiro
contends, and we agree, that the delays relating to the control points ran concurrently with the delays
caused by the redesign of the structural steel. (Tr. 386). In addition, we find that Beiro was not
responsible for critical path delays to the project. In particular, the District’s position that Beiro was
responsible for the concrete cracking and deflections, is unsupported by the record. We credit
Appellants’ concrete experts who testified that Beiro followed the contract and industry standards
for concrete placement at the Prevocational project. We find that the concrete problems were caused
by the structural steel design deficiencies for which the District and its contracted architect are
responsible.

        PCO 10A

       PCO 10A was submitted by Beiro on March 12, 1987 in the amount of $637,367.00. (AEX
245). The claimed costs were:

Direct costs of BCD No. 4:                      $ 22,103.00
Subcontractor impact & extension costs:         $ 65,320.00
Winter concrete impact costs:                   $ 53,774.00
Extended performance (90 days):                 $496,170.00
Total:                                          $637,367.00

       We sustain the direct costs of $22,103, consisting of additional Beiro engineering ($1,264),
subcontractor costs (Mid-Atlantic Steel ($4,095), CECO ($14,520) and A&L Painters ($18.00)), and
Beiro mark-up. (AEX 245, at 401702; Tr. 461-62).

        Beiro claims the following subcontractor impact and extension costs: CECO ($41,789),
Mid-Atlantic Steel ($17,267), and Beiro mark-up. (AEX 245, at 401300). Appellants agree that the
CECO costs should be removed because they are included in other PCOs. (AEX 245, at 401306).
In the subcontractor claim section supra, we partially sustained Mid-Atlantic Steel’s impact claim in
the amount of $2,563. With Beiro mark-ups, this portion is sustained in the amount of $2,833.

       As a result of early project delays, Beiro was forced to perform a substantial amount of
concrete work in the January-February 1985. (Tr. 462). These costs include additional charges for
                                                 - 25 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



concrete additives, inefficiencies, and winter protection/heating of concrete. (AEX 24, at 401316-
324; Tr. 462). We sustain labor costs of $17,424, equipment costs of $1,266, and heating costs of
$12,830. The total of these costs with Beiro’s mark-up is $33,445.

        In their posthearing brief, Appellants revised their claim for extended performance costs
from $496,170 (based on a 90-day extension at a daily rate of $5,513) to $177,842 (90 days at a
daily rate of $1,976), removing certain subcontractor claim amounts. As detailed below, we find a
composite daily rate of $1,900 supported by the record, consisting of daily rates of $1,168 for project
office expenses, $18 for material escalation, and $714 for home office G&A expenses.

        Project office expenses included Beiro’s field office labor (supervisory, layout, mobilization,
cleanup, pump and bail footings, Government trailer support, safety, and security costs), field office
general expenses (engineering and tests, utilities, small tools, fencing, safety, signs and photos, site
security, insurance, and CPM consultant), and field office equipment and construction equipment.
Beiro pooled these costs and added appropriate mark-ups, yielding total project office expenses of
$815,463 from Notice to Proceed (July 9, 1984) through cessation of work on March 7, 1986.
(AEX 245, at 401355; Tr. 462-64, 467-68). We have revised Appellants’ calculation of project
office expenses recovered on other PCOs from $112,140 to $106,561, which is then deducted from
the total project office expense of $815,463, to yield $708,902. Dividing this total by the
performance period of 607 calendar days yields a daily project office expense of $1,168. (AEX 245,
at 401355; Appellants’ Posthearing Brief, Appendix B; Tr. 467-68).

        Beiro computed its costs for material and wage escalation as a result of the delays in the
amount of $36,044.00. (AEX 245, at 401351). Based on the status of Project completion at the time
of termination, Appellants concede that the escalation for topsoil ($600), sod ($109), seeding ($235)
and wood paneling labor ($1,000), were likely not incurred. We also remove plywood paneling
($3,500), drywall materials ($10,000) and drywall labor ($5,000). Adjusting this component, with
appropriate markups, yields a revised amount of $10,899, which yields a daily rate of $18.

        As the final element of its extended performance costs, Beiro included home office G&A
expenses calculated using the Eichleay formula yielding a daily G&A rate of $605. (AEX 245, at
401326; Tr. 466-67). Appellants have replaced that G&A rate with the $729 daily rate calculated by
Ernst & Young. (AEX 458, at 37). Ernst & Young calculated its rate using a “performance period”
of July 1984 through July 1987. We believe that the suspension period from approximately March
1986 through termination in July 1987 does not provide reasonable G&A allocations with Beiro total
direct costs because during that period the business was winding down and the record does not
contain the 1986 and 1987 financial records for us to review and evaluate G&A costs. We will
confine the performance period to the pre-suspension period and use the financial information
provided for 1984 and 1985 to provide a more accurate measure of home office overhead. Thus,
prorating for the period of July 1984 through December 1985, we find total Beiro direct costs of
$58,333,162. (AEX 403-404). After deducting unallowable or unsupported G&A costs (the
“Repairs, maintenance and operations” under “Indirect costs”, travel and entertainment,
contributions, and $350,000 from the excessive 1984 “Management fees”), and prorating for the July
1984 through December 1985 period, we find total Beiro allowable G&A costs of $4,018,182
                                                - 26 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



($1,017,999 for 1984, $3,000,183 for 1985). Beiro’s direct costs on the Prevocational project are
$6,294,239. Multiplying total prorated G&A of $4,435,306 by the ratio of Prevocational project
costs to total Beiro direct costs yields $433,568 in G&A allocable to the contract, and divided by the
performance period of 607 days provides a daily rate of $714. With the adjustments discussed
above, the extended performance costs per day is $1,900. Accordingly, extended performance costs
for the 60-day delay period total $114,000.

      We sustain PCO 10A costs in the amount of $172,381 (consisting of $22,103, $2,833,
$33,445, plus $114,000).

       PCO 10B

         We previously found that the substantial changes to the structural steel caused 150 days of
critical path delay. Using the daily rate of $1,900 calculated in connection with PCO 10A, we find
home office costs of $285,000. Lynn Fabricators' cost proposal in the amount of $301,209 for the
structural steel changes and delays, included by Beiro in its PCO 10B, was previously denied as a
subcontractor claim for lack of support in the record. We sustain Beiro’s additional engineering
costs of $1,015. (AEX 246; Tr. 464). PCO 10B costs therefore total $286,015.

       PCO 10C

        The District issued BCD No. 8 on November 20, 1984, making a number of changes to the
structural steel for the project. Beiro’s PCO 10C includes only those direct costs for additional
fireproofing work in the amount of $505.00. This claim was settled with District representatives for
$306, which we sustain. (AEX 231, 247; Tr. 80-81, 12).

       PCO 10E

       In response to Beiro’s Notice and Request No. 26 (AEX 200), the District issued a sketch
(SK-9), relating to concrete beam #1. Beiro submitted PCO 10E in the amount of $1,003 for the
extra work associated with the change. There appears to be duplication of costs in this claim and
PCO 35. We deny the claim for lack of adequate support in the record.

       PCO 10G

       In response to Beiro’s Notice and Request 212 (AEX 209), the District directed removal and
replacement of a masonry wall at the north side of the gymnasium. Beiro submitted a change order
proposal in the amount of $1,354. We are not persuaded that the work was a compensable change to
the contract because Beiro or its subcontractors appear to have initially misread the applicable
drawings. (AEX 249; AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 83-84)). Accordingly, we deny the claim.

       PCO 10I

       Due to changes to the structural steel, Beiro was forced to pour the concrete loading dock out
                                                 - 27 -                 A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



of sequence. Beiro had to protect the concrete by means of plywood. Beiro submitted its PCO 10I
in the amount of $1,747.00 for the plywood protection. We sustain the claim in the amount of
$1,747. (AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 84-85).

        PCO 13

        The District issued BCD No. 3 on August 3, 1984, directing major revisions to the site water
mains and storm drains. The District also issued BCD No. 16 on April 1, 1985, which, among other
things, changed the site sewer lines. BCD No. 22, dated June 22, 1985, also made changes to the
storm and sanitary lines. Beiro included each of the site utility changes into its PCO 13 in the
amount of $268,704. District representatives settled this PCO with Beiro for $211,360. (AEX 251,
at 402149; AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 85-87); AEX 454 (McConnell Tr. 480-82); AEX 457 (McConnell
Tr. 13)). Beiro estimated that 50 percent of this work was completed before termination, for a PCO
value of $105,680.00. (AEX 454 (McConnell Tr. 482); AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 86); AEX 237). The
District agrees with entitlement and quantum. (DEX 231). Accordingly, we sustain the claim in the
amount of $105,680.

        PCO 14

       Due to the unsuitability of the soil at the elevations prescribed by the District for the building
footings, Beiro was forced to over-excavate the footings and provide additional fill. Beiro submitted
PCO 14 to the District in the amount of $257,636. Except for an amount of $5,979, we find the
claim adequately supported by the record and therefore sustain it in a total amount of $251,657.
(AEX 251A; AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 87-88); AEX 454 (McConnell Tr. 483-86)).

        PCO 15

        As documented in Beiro’s Notice and Requests Nos. 3 and 10 dated August 23, 1984, the
District directed Beiro to install a wall in the gymnasium area with a curved radius as opposed to an
angle. (AEX 252). Beiro submitted its PCO 15 in the amount of $452. We sustain the claim in the
amount of $414. (AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 88-89)).

        PCO 16

        The contract permitted Beiro to use existing site material as backfill. (AEX 3, ¶ 2.01). The
District rejected the backfill material and required Beiro to haul away the existing material and
purchase and haul new backfill to the site. Beiro submitted its PCO 16 in the amount of $33,629.00.
The record adequately supports costs of $25,600, which is the amount we sustain. (AEX 253; Tr.
732-36; AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 89-90)).


        PCO 17

        On September 26, 1984, the District’s Acting Chief, Bureau of Building Construction
                                               - 28 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



Services, issued a clarification letter to Beiro which made 16 changes to various structural and
architectural drawings. Beiro submitted its PCO 17 in the amount of $1,251 for the additional
column forming and rebar work. We sustain the claim in the amount of $1,230. (AEX 254; AEX
256 (Murray Tr. 91-92)).

       PCO 18

        The District’s architect issued a sketch making changes to the details for windows 18 and 19
of the building. Beiro submitted its PCO 18 in the amount of $946, which was settled with District
representatives for $780. We sustain the claim in that amount. (DEX 231; AEX 255).

       PCO 19

        The District, by letter and sketch dated October 15, 1994, provided Beiro with changed work
relating to the tie-in of the 4" planter drains. Beiro submitted its PCO 19 in the amount of
$15,350.00 for the extra work. We find the claimed costs excessive. The record supports costs of
$4,000, which we sustain. (AEX 256; AEX 256 (Murray Tr. 93-94)).

       PCO 21

        In response to Beiro’s Notice and Request No. 31, dated October 5, 1984, the District’s
architect issued a sketch revising certain dimensions on Stair 5. Beiro submitted its PCO 21 in the
amount of $5,777.00 for the additional excavation, framework, fill and layout of the stair. We
believe that some of the costs cover the original contract work and have not been properly credited
in Beiro’s cost proposal. We allow $764 in burdened labor, $600 in materials, $140 for equipment,
and subcontractor costs of $227, and with mark-ups, for a total of $1,984. (AEX 257; AEX 256
(Murray Tr. 95)).

       PCO 23

         The District issued BCD No. 13 on March 7, 1985, directing, among other work, changes to
the first floor slab cantilever and reinforcing. Beiro submitted its PCO 23 in the amount of $710 for
this work. (AEX 258). This change was settled with District representatives for $688. (AEX 256
(Murray Tr. 96-98); AEX 257 (McConnell Tr. 14)). The District agrees with entitlement and
quantum. (DEX 231). We sustain the claim in the amount of $688.

       PCO 25

        In response to Beiro’s Notice and Request No. 25, the architect issued a sketch moving a rain
leader trap from below a footing to the side of the footing. Beiro submitted its PCO 25 in the
amount of $1,642 consisting of a BPI proposal of $1,492 for the changed work along with Beiro
mark-ups making a total claim of $1,642. We are not persuaded that the work as changed increased
the cost of performance. We deny the claim. (AEX 259; AEX 256 (Murray Tr. 98-99)).
                                                - 29 -                A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



       PCO 26

        The District issued BCD No. 8 on November 26, 1984, modifying the roof framing in the
lobby area, among other things. Beiro submitted its PCO 26 in the amount of $1,203 for this work.
(AEX 260). This PCO was settled with District representatives for $1,194. (AEX 256 (Murray Tr.
99-101)). The District does not dispute entitlement or quantum. (DEX 231). We sustain PCO 26 for
the agreed amount.

       PCO 27

        By letter dated November 8, 1984, the District, among other things, changed the location of
freezer condensers from the electrical room to the roof as a result of the electrical room having
insufficient space to meet the clearance requirements of the National Electrical Code. (AEX 261).
Beiro submitted its PCO 27 for the changed work in the amount of $18,305. Beiro estimates that 50
percent of this extra work ($9,152.50) was performed prior to termination. (AEX 256 (Murray Tr.
102)). Based on our review of the record, we find support for Beiro costs of $2,682 and Bratti
Associates costs of $286, for a total amount sustained of $2,968. We are not persuaded by the
record that the other subcontractor costs totaling $13,422 were actually incurred and paid.

       PCO 28

        The District refused to permit Beiro to use on-site material for backfill of interior pipe
excavations which were under the building’s ground slab. Paragraph 3.04B of the specifications
indicates the use of type M-1 backfill material for interior areas where “fills are required to provide
proper levels for slabs or gravel fill under slabs on ground.” The District argues that because the
pipe trenches are interior spaces under the ground slab, Paragraph 3.04 requires M-1 material. Beiro
claims that M-1 fill is only required to provide proper levels for slabs, not pipe excavations. We
believe the District’s interpretation is the more reasonable. Accordingly, we deny Beiro’s PCO 28
claim for $66,083. (AEX 262).

       PCO 30

       The District issued FWA 2 on November 1, 1984, directing revisions to light fixtures which
would not have fit properly as originally designed. Beiro submitted its PCO 30 in the amount of
$3,323.00 for the light fixtures revisions and associated changes in the reinforcing steel. We are not
persuaded from the record that the costs were actually incurred, with the exception of the claim for
$116 by Mid-Atlantic Steel. (AEX 263). With mark-up, we sustain the claim in the amount of
$128.

       PCO 32

        In response to Beiro’s Notice and Request No. 34, the District issued a sketch clarifying
certain details of the electrical room wall/foundation and adding a galvanized steel plate. Beiro

       PCO 184A

        In response to Beiro's Notice and Request No. 225 and Sketch No. 47 from the architect, the
District directed the relocation of the chiller. (AEX 349, at 411579). Beiro submitted its PCO 184A
in the amount of $9,272 for the extra work. (AEX 349). Appellants deduct a total of $392 from the
claim because some of the work had not been performed. In addition, because the record does not
show that Beiro paid BPI and Hampshire their claimed costs, we remove $8,240 from the claim
amount and sustain the claim in the amount of $640.

       PCO 186

        The District issued BCD No. 34 on December 26, 1985, directing Beiro to relocate certain
piping and ductwork and provide an additional pipe chase due to conflicts in mechanical and
electrical systems under the mechanical room. Beiro submitted its PCO 186 in the amount of
$50,739 for the extra work. (AEX 350). Beiro estimates that 30 percent of the changed work was
completed prior to termination. The District does not dispute entitlement or quantum. (DEX 231).
We sustain the claim in the amount of $15,222.

       PCO 187

        In response to Beiro's Notice and Request No. 231 concerning conflicts with ductwork,
piping and electrical above the ceilings, the District directed Beiro to drop certain ceiling heights
and re-route certain piping. (AEX 351, at 411829). Beiro submitted its PCO 187 in the amount of
$15,009 for the changed work. Applying Beiro’s estimate of 75 percent completion to the costs
shown by the record to have been paid, we sustain the claim in the amount of $9,983. (AEX 351).

       PCO 195

      In order to prepare a proposal for the changed work depicted on the Mok change order
drawings, Beiro engaged a subcontractor, Construction Engineering Services, Inc., to conduct field
measurements and prepare shop drawings. Beiro submitted its PCO 195 in the amount of $3,016 for
                                               - 46 -               A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



the extra work. (AEX 352). We sustain the claim in the amount of $3,016.

       PCO 196

        The District issued an FWA on January 17, 1986, directing Beiro to take field measurements
of the clerestory window openings and report the measurements to the architect. The measurements
were necessary because the opening size for the window openings varied. Beiro submitted its PCO
196 in the amount of $973 for the additional work. The change was settled with District
representatives for $931. (AEX 353, at. 412407, 402399). The District does not dispute entitlement
or quantum. (DEX 231). We sustain the claim in the amount of $931.

       PCO 197

       Appellants have withdrawn this PCO, in the amount of $1,985.00.

       PCO 198

        In response to Beiro's Notice and Request No. 153, the District resolved certain dimensional
conflicts between the architectural and structural drawings for the ceiling of Room 192. (AEX 355,
at 412441). Beiro submitted its PCO 198 in the amount of $206 for the extra layout work involved.
The change was settled with District representatives for the full amount of $206. (AEX 457
(McConnell Tr. 44-45); AEX 355, at 412433, 412439). The District does not dispute entitlement or
quantum. (DEX 231). We sustain the claim in the amount of $206.

       PCO 199

         In response to Beiro's Notice and Request No. 223, concerning conflicts in the ceiling of
Room 192, the District directed the installation of a drop ceiling and CMU chase wall. (AEX 356, at
412446, 412458). Beiro submitted its PCO 199 in the amount of $2,596 for the extra work. (AEX
356; AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 209-10)). Beiro estimates 50 percent of this work was performed prior
to termination. (Id., Tr. 210). We are not persuaded that BPI actually performed the work identified
in its proposal. R. Bratti’s claim is not adequately supported. Applying a completion factor of 50
percent to Beiro’s costs yields $614, which is the amount we sustain for the claim.



       PCO 211

        Beiro submitted PCO 211 to the District on March 10, 1987, for the costs incurred by Beiro
during the suspension of work period. (AEX 122; AEX 455 (Murray Tr. 740); AEX 456 (Murray
Tr. 210-11)). Beiro's submission of PCO 211 was made with an understanding that the work was to
be restarted within 60 days. (AEX 122). PCO 211 was revised by Beiro's Mr. Murray prior to the
1992 hearing to reflect the fact that the project had been terminated. (AEX 456 (Murray Tr. 210-
211)). In PCO 211, as revised, Beiro seeks costs during the 552-day suspension of work period in
the amount of $725,006. (AEX 357). Appellants made one additional revision, which was to use
                                               - 47 -               A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



Ernst & Young’s daily G&A rate in their calculation of extended G&A costs, thereby reducing the
price for PCO 211 to $679,982.

         Appellants seek direct labor of $87,841, consisting of extended project maintenance of
$84,498, storage and material handling of $1,950, and demobilization of $1,393. Beiro’s claimed
project maintenance consists of labor costs for one project manager 3 days per week for 39 weeks
($13,455), another project manager 5 days per week for 37 weeks ($21,275), a superintendent 5 days
per week for 16 weeks ($12,000), another superintendent half a day per week for 60 weeks ($4,500),
and a project engineer 1 day per week for 8 weeks ($880). We find the amount of “project
management supervision during the suspension” to be excessive for the level of activity at the job
site for the period March 1986 through the July 31, 1987 termination. We allow $15,000 for project
management and supervision. The other labor component of project maintenance is project site
security for the period from March 1986 through July 31, 1987, in the amount of $32,388. We allow
the entire amount. Thus, we sustain project maintenance labor of $47,388. We also sustain the
storage and material handling labor of $1,950 and the demobilization labor of $1,393. Total
allowable labor is $50,731.

        Appellants also seek “materials, equipment, and services” costs of $99,730, consisting of
extended project maintenance of $98,046, storage and material handling of $504, and demobilization
of $1,180. The project maintenance material costs claimed for project management ($8,892) is
reduced to $2,000. The material costs for project site security of $34,759 are sustained. Other
material costs we sustain are: extended risk insurance coverage ($7,894), field office trailers
($10,996), 8 material storage trailers ($23,758), and project utilities ($11,747). Thus, we sustain
project maintenance materials, equipment, and services amounting to $79,407. We also sustain
material and equipment costs for additional storage and material handling of $504 and $1,180 for
project demobilization. Total allowable materials, equipment, and services costs equal $81,091.

        Finally, Appellants seek extended G&A overhead totaling $679,982 during the 552-day
suspension period using a $727 daily G&A rate calculated by Ernst & Young. For the reasons
discussed earlier in connection with Appellants’ claim for $377,760 in unabsorbed overhead costs
during the suspension period, we find the District’s suspension of work on the Prevocational job was
not the proximate cause of Beiro’s inability to obtain other bonded work during the delay period but
rather a further impediment to financial recovery. We do not find the District liable for Beiro’s
unabsorbed overhead during the suspension period.


       In sum, for PCO 211, we sustain Appellants’ suspension claim in the total amount of
$131,822.

       Adjusted Contract Price/Contract Cap Summaries

       We have previously found PCO costs totaling $1,346,472. The amount of uncompleted
contract work must be deducted, along with payments received from the District, from the adjusted
contract price. We find uncompleted contract work to be 33 percent of the original contract amount
based on a 67 percent contract amount completed figure set forth in Payment Requisition 19 which
                                               - 48 -                 A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., CAB No. D-822



covered performance through February 25, 1986, three days before the stop work order. We
summarize our findings on the adjusted contract cap is as follows:

               Original Contract Value:                               $ 8,098,000
               Less:
               Deductive Change Order No. 1:                          $    (13,295)
                       Contract Subtotal:                             $ 8,084,705
               Plus:
               Subcontractor T for C Claims:            $   168,954
               Beiro Overhead (10%):                    $    16,895
                       Subtotal:                        $   185,849
               Beiro Profit (10%):                      $    18,585
                       Subtotal:                                      $    204,434
               PCO Costs:                                             $ 1,346,472


               Adjusted Contract Price                                $ 9,635,611



               Less:
               Uncompleted contract work (33%)                        $ 2,672,340
               Payments Received                                      $ 5,280,934


               Adjusted Contract Price Cap:                           $ 1,682,337

        Because Beiro’s adjusted contract price cap is less than total unpaid performance costs
($2,673,765), Appellants’ recovery is limited to the amount of the adjusted contract price cap of
$1,682,337. Appellants other termination costs are not affected by the adjusted contract price cap.
In summary, Appellants are entitled to unpaid contract costs (limited to contract cap) of $1,682,337
and settlement expenses of $131,004, plus interest on those amounts as specified in Section C.
