                                           OPINION
                                         Filing ID 25506948


         i.c.a.STAR.n.u (“STAR”) has protested the contracting officer’s decision not to award it
a youth mentoring contract. The District has moved to dismiss the protest on the ground that
STAR lacks standing. STAR has not challenged the two awards made by CFSA and does not
allege that CFSA violated any law, regulation, or the terms of the solicitation. Even if we could
discern a valid challenge to the awards, STAR lacks standing to protest, as it would not be next
in line for an award if we were to sustain its protest grounds. Accordingly, we dismiss the
protest.

                                       BACKGROUND

       On September 24, 2008, the District of Columbia’s Child and Family Services Agency
(“CFSA”) issued IFB No. CFSA-08-I-0004 (“IFB”) for a proposed indefinite delivery indefinite
quantity (“IDIQ”) contract. The IFB sought qualified contractor(s) to provide mentoring
services for up to 500 clients, with a bid opening date of October 24, 2008. (District’s Motion to
Dismiss, Ex. 1). CFSA set forth in Section B.3 the method of bid evaluation, based on the
hourly rate for each CLIN times 288 hours for each CLIN. The 288 hours represented the
number of hours of mentoring services one client could receive during the contract term.
(Motion to Dismiss, at 2; Exs. 1, 14). On October 15, 2008, CFSA issued Amendment No. 1,
which provided responses to bidders’ questions. (Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 2). On October 24,
2008, CFSA received a total of 23 bids, four of which were received after bid opening and not
opened. (Motion to Dismiss, at 2).

       CFSA prepared bid tabulation sheets of the bidders (Motion to Dismiss Ex. 13) indicating
that M.M.G. LLC (“M.M.G.”) offered the lowest total bid price of $24,480. Our Future offered
the second lowest total bid price of $25,056. Culbreth & Culbreth Consultant, Inc. (“Culbreth”)
offered the third lowest total bid price of $28,494.72, and Family Enrichment Center offered the
fourth lowest total bid price of $28,512. (Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 13; District Reply, dated
March 19, 2009, Ex. A). CFSA determined M.M.G., the lowest bidder, to be nonresponsible.
(Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 14), and on December 31, 2008, CFSA awarded Contract No. CFSA-09-
C-0133 to the second lowest bidder, Our Future. (Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 11). On January 31,
2009, CFSA awarded Contract No. CFSA-09-C-0130 (“Contract No. 0130”) to the third lowest

                                                                                  CAB No. P-0795

bidder, Culbreth. (Motion to Dismiss, Ex. 12). The contracting officer has not awarded a
contract for the remaining 80 clients. (Motion to Dismiss, at 3; District Reply, at 3).

       On February 6, 2009, STAR filed the instant protest with the Board alleging that:

       1.      STAR did not fully understand the contracting process;
       2.      STAR’s contract has always been negotiable on price when it pertains to
               keeping the clients’ services in place;
       3.      STAR has contracted with CFSA for 11 years and the price has never
               increased or decreased;
       4.      Six years ago CFSA had two companies servicing hundreds of children
               and CFSA hired more contractors to avoid the displacement of children
               should one of the contractors be unable to perform;
       5       STAR cannot understand why CFSA would sever an excellent relationship
               with STAR when STAR is willing to negotiate a reduction in price; and
       6.      STAR mentors will not work with the two companies that CFSA awarded
               contracts to pursuant to the IFB.

        On February 26, 2009, the District filed a motion to dismiss asserting that STAR lacks
standing to protest since STAR is not next in line for award even if the protest were sustained,
and, moreover, even on the merits, none of the six protest grounds raised by STAR is an
adequate ground for protest. On March 8, 2009, the STAR filed its opposition, raising two new
issues: (1) the District incorrectly indicates in the bid tabulation sheets (Exhibit 13) that STAR
was eighth in line for award when in fact STAR was tied for fourth place with three other
bidders, and (2) that Family Enrichment is a nonresponsible bidder. As a result of the STAR’s
opposition, CFSA conducted a complete and thorough review of the bids and CFSA produced a
revised bid tabulation sheet which was submitted as Exhibit A to the District’s March 19, 2009
reply to STAR’s opposition. Below is a table summarizing the revised bid tabulation of Exhibit
A (excluding bidders ranked below STAR):

       BIDDERS                Total Price Per               LSDBE          Adjusted Value

                              Options

       1. M.M.G.             $24,480.00                     0              $24,480.00
       2. Our Future         $25,056.00                     0              $25,056.00
       3. Culbreth           $28,494.72                     0              $28,494.72
       4. Family Enrichment $28,512.00                      0              $28,512.00
       5. Kidd International $37,324.80                     10 %           $33,592.32
       6. Steppingstones     $38,992.32                     12 %           $34,313.24
       7. Greater Fellowship $34,560.00                     0              $34,560.00
       7. Way of the Word $34,560.00                        0              $34,560.00
       7. GANG               $34,560.00                     0              $34,560.00
       7. STAR               $34,560.00                     0              $34,560.00
                                                 -3-                                 i.c.a.STAR..n.u
                                                                                    CAB No. P-0795

         As can be seen from the revised bid tabulation sheet, the rankings of the first four bidders
did not change even though CFSA corrected several bid prices. M.M.G. still offered the lowest
total bid price of $24,480.00 but was determined nonresponsible and therefore eliminated from
the competition. Our Future still offered the second lowest total bid price of $25,056, Culbreth
still offered the third lowest total bid price of $28,494.72, and Family Enrichment still offered
the fourth lowest total bid price of $28,512. (District’s March 19 Reply, Ex. A). However, the
revised bid tabulation sheet shows two other bidders with the fifth and sixth low evaluated bids –
namely, Kidd International Home Care, and Steppingstones Management Services, LLC, based
on their right to a bid reduction based on preferences for being local, small, and disadvantaged
business enterprises. In addition, CFSA determined that there was an error in the unit prices for
both Steppingstones and for STAR. Accordingly, the revised bid tabulation indicates that
beyond the awardees (Our Future and Culbreth), Family Enrichment, Kidd International, and
Steppingstones have lower evaluated bids than STAR. STAR challenged the responsibility of
Family Enrichment in its opposition to the District’s motion to dismiss. STAR has never
responded to the District’s reply with the revised bid tabulation sheet showing STAR is tied for
seventh with three intervening bidders ahead of it.


                                          DISCUSSION

       We exercise jurisdiction over this protest pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03(a)(1).

        The Board notes that none of STAR’s six protest grounds allege that CFSA violated any
procurement law or regulation or the terms of the solicitation. STAR does not challenge the two
awards but rather argues that CFSA should have continued to contract with STAR
notwithstanding the new procurement. STAR misunderstands the nature of a competitive
procurement under District procurement law. We see nothing in the record demonstrating that
CFSA improperly conducted this procurement. In response to the District’s motion to dismiss,
raising STAR’s lack of standing to challenge the awards (which STAR really does not
challenge), STAR has only alleged that one bidder should have been determined nonresponsible.
Thus, this protest can be dismissed on two bases. First, STAR does not properly challenge the
awards made to Our Future and Culbreth and alleges no violation of the law in its protest
grounds. Second, even if we could treat the protest as challenging the awards, STAR lacks
standing because it is not in line for award if we were to find merit in its protest grounds.
Commando K-9 Detectives, Inc., CAB Nos. P-0405, Aug. 18, 1995, 42 D.C. Reg. 4597, 4598
(protester lacks standing because it is not next in line for award even if the protest were
sustained).

                                         CONCLUSION

        STAR has not challenged the two awards made by CFSA and does not allege that CFSA
violated any law, regulation, or the terms of the solicitation. Even if we could discern a valid
challenge to the awards, STAR lacks standing to protest, as it would not be next in line for an
award if we were to sustain its protest grounds. Accordingly, we dismiss the protest.
