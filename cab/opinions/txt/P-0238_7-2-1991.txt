                Protestor Anne Robertson Sellin (Protestor, Ms. Sellin) has challenged the process
         used by the District of Columbia Department of Public Works (District) to enter into a
         contract for a historic survey of the McMillan Reservoir. Ms. Sellin asserts that because
         the contract entered into by the District and Engineering Science for the survey was not
         advertised and subjected to the competitive bidding process, the District is in violation of
         D.C. Code §§ 1-1183.3, 1-1183.4, and applicable regulations at 27 DCMR §§ 1300.1 -
         1300.4. Protestor requests the Board to void the contract award and order the District
         to comply with the competitive bidding process as set forth in the referenced provisions
         of the D.C. Code. The instant protest was filed on May 16, 1990.

               On August 14, 1990, the District filed a Motion to Dismiss the protest.!I In its
         Motion to Dismiss the District explains that D.C. Formal Agreement No. J89-009
         was procured as an architectural-engineering services contract and was exempted from



           VOn July 15, 1990, the District filed a Motion for Enlargement of Time, which motion was opposed by
         Protestor on June 21, 1990. By Order dated June 25, 1990, the Board extended the time within which the
         agency report could be filed to July 26, 1990. On August 14, 1990, the District filed a Motion to Accept
         Agency Motion to Dismiss Out of Time. On August 24, 1990, the Protestor filed its Opposition to Motion
         to Accept Agency Motion Out of Time. On September 28, 1990, Protestor filed its opposition to the
         District's Motion to Dismiss.

           WHEREFORE, upon consideration of the District'S Motion to Accept Agency Motion to Dismiss Out of
         Time, and it appearing good cause has been shown, said motion is GRANTED.

        pre-solicitation advertising pursuant to Title 27 DCMR § 1300.7.Y According to the
        District, only individuals, firms, partnerships or corporations licensed by the District to
        practice architecture or engineering are eligible for award of such contracts by the
        District. The District utilizes the selection procedures set forth in 27 DCMR § 2620 et
        seq. for architect-engineering services.

                With regard to Formal Agreement No. J89-009, the District explains that on
        November 14, 1988, it advertised for expressions of interest for open-end architect-
        engineer contracts for archaeological consultant services. Ten firms submitted qualifica-
        tion statements and Engineering Science, Inc., was selected by the District as most
        qualified. On April 18, 1989, the District and Engineering Science executed Formal
        Agreement No. J89-009.       More than one year later, on April 24, 1990, Ms. Sellin
        inquired about advertisement of the project. On May 11, 1990, Ms. Sellin filed a
        protest of the award of the contract.

               The District argues that the procurement procedures for architect-engineers
       provide for solicitations of "qualified persons," who subsequently are selected to negotiate
       particular contracts. Therefore, according to the District, in order to be an aggrieved
       person sufficient to protest the award of an architect-engineering contract, a person must
       (1) have actually submitted an expression of interest pursuant to the agency's
       advertisement, or (2) be eligible and likely to have submitted an expression of interest
       pursuant to the advertisement. The District further argues that Ms. Sellin (1) failed to
       actually submit an expression of interest pursuant to advertisement; and (2) does not
       allege that she is an architect or engineer and thus qualified as eligible to submit
       qualifications in response to the advertisement, or one who prospectively would have


         ~h7 DCMR § 1300.7 provides:

          The requirements for pre· solicitation advertiSing set forth in this section shall not apply to any of the
       following:

          (a)   Sole source procurements under chapter 17 of this title;

          (b)   Emergency procurements under chapter 17 of this title;

          (c)   Small purchases under chapter 18 of this title; or

          (d)   Procurement of architect.engineering services, medical and human care services, or real property
                appraisal services.

           The Boord notes that the advertising requirements for architect.engineering contracts set forth in
       DCMR are not without ambiguity. While 27 DCMR § 1300.7, quoted above, would exempt these contracts
       from Chapter 13 pre· solicitation advertising, 27 DCMR § 2620.1, requires that, "The contracting officer
       sholl publicize all requirements for architect engineering services in accordance with chapter 13 of this
       title.... " However, as further discussed, infra, the District has satisfied the advertising requirements of
       Chapter 13 with regard to Fonnol Agreement No. J89.oo9, in any event.

          submitted her qualifications. Finally, the District argues that the protest was not timely
          filed because the November 14, 1988 advertisement was constructive notice and Ms.
          Sellin should have known the basis for her protest at the time of publication.

                In opposition to the District's Motion to Dismiss, Ms. Sellin argues that although
         the District may call the contract one for "architectural-engineering services," the services
         required under the contract are actually for historic research. Therefore, because the
         contract requires a historic survey of McMillan Park rather than architectural or
         engineering services, 27 DCMR § 1300.7 does not apply, according to the Protestor.
         Furthermore, because the contract does not require an architect-engineer, the fact that
         Ms. Sellin is not a professional architect or engineer is irrelevant, according to Protestor.

                The Board does not agree. Both the Invitation for Expression of Interest for
         Open End A-E Contracts for Archaeological Consulting Services (Attachment A to
         Motion to Dismiss) and Formal Agreement No. J89-009 (Attachment C to Motion to
         Dismiss) reflect the fact that the District had determined that it required the services of
         an architect-engineer to perform the work for the project at issue. Furthermore, in light
         of the fact that the District properly complied with 27 DCMR § § 2620 et seq., the
         Board's review of this matter need go no further. It is not the function of the Board to
         second-guess the District's determination that the services of an architect-engineer were
         necessary or appropriate.

                 With regard to the District' claim that Protestor is not an aggrieved party, the
         District cites Protest of Purac Engineering. Inc., CAB No. P-157, 38 DCR 2974 (1989);
         Protest of Schwing America. Inc., CAB No. P-156, 38 DCR 2963 (1989); and Protest of
         Remco Business Systems. Inc., CAB No. P-131, 36 DCR 4016 (1988) for the proposition
         that a protestor who is not found to be an actual or prospective bidder lacks standing to
         file a protest with the Board. The Board agrees. Because Ms. Sellin is not a licensed
         architect or engineer, she would have been ineligible for award and so was not an
         interested or aggrieved party who could invoke the jurisdiction of the Board pursuant to
         the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985 (PPA) , D.C. Code §1-1189.3(1).

                Protestor further argues that the advertisement did not constitute adequate public
         notice as required by the PPA, D.C. Code § 1-1183.3(c) because it did not appear in any
         trade publications. The Board notes that the PPA, D.C. Code § 1-1183(c), and 27
         DCMR § 1300.4 require,

                 "The advertisement shall appear at least once in a newspaper of general
                 circulation and any trade publications considered appropriate by the
                 Director.••." (Emphasis added.)

        The District submits that the advertisement was published in the Washington Post,
        Washington Times, Afro American, and EI Pregonero. (District's letter of September 13,

          1990, filed pursuant to Board Order dated September 10, 1990.) In that the D.C. Code
          and DCMR leave within the discretion of the District which, if any, trade publications
          should be used to satisfy the notice requirements, the Board finds that the District's
          notice in this instance was adequate.

                 Finally, Ms. Sellin claims that her protest was timely filed because she first
         learned on May 2, 1990 that a contract for the survey had already been awarded, and
         her protest was filed on May 11, 1990. The Board's rules require that the protest shall
         be filed not later than ten days after the basis of the protest is known or should have
         been known, whichever is earlier. See, Rule 301.1, 36 DCR 2710 (1989). Because the
         advertisement was published in newspapers of general circulation on November 14, 1988,
         Ms. Sellin should have known the basis for her protest at that time because it was then
         clear that the invitation was for an architect-engineer contract for archaeological consul-
         tant services. Thus, given this constructive notice, the protest was not timely filed.

                WHEREFORE, finding that (1) the solicitation was properly in accordance with
         27 DCMR § § 2620 et seq., (2) the Protestor lacks standing as an actual or a prospective
         bidder, and (3) the protest was not timely filed, the protest is hereby DISMISSED, with
         prejudice.
