                                            OPINION
                                   (Lexis-Nexis Filing ID 5020670)

        SAFE, Inc. (“SAFE”), by letter to this Board dated November 15, 2004, requests that the
Department of Health (“DOH”), HIV/AIDS Administration, extend the deadline for submission
of applications for the FY 2005 Ryan White Title I Regional Grant for HIV/AIDS services
(Request for Applications (“RFA”) No. 1001-04-FY 2005) by one week to November 22, 2004,
from November 15, 2004. SAFE asserts that the District failed to properly post the existing
Amendments and Responses to applicant’s questions in a timely manner before the RFA
submission date of November 15, 2004, at 5:00 p.m. In its Motion to Dismiss, the District
responds that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider a protest regarding a grant application. The
protester did not file comments on the District’s Motion to Dismiss. We agree with the District
that we do not have jurisdiction and we dismiss the protest.


                                        BACKGROUND

       On October 1, 2004, DOH placed in the District Register an announcement of the RFA
and posted the RFA on the DOH Website. DOH held a pre-application conference on October
14, 2004. On November 1 and November 9, 2004, DOH posted on its website questions
submitted by interested grant applicants and answers to those questions prepared by DOH. On
November 3 and November 8, 2004, DOH sent to all organizations that had expressed an interest
in the RFA certain amendments that consisted of questions submitted by interested grant
applicants and answers to those questions prepared by DOH. SAFE filed its protest on
November 15, 2004, alleging that DOH belatedly notified SAFE of information that was
necessary for SAFE to satisfactorily complete and file with DOH its response to the RFA.

                                         DISCUSSION

       The protester asserts that the District failed to properly post the existing Amendments and
                                                 2                        SAFE, Inc. CAB No. P-0702


Responses to applicant’s questions in a timely manner before the RFA submission date of
November 15, 2004. In its Motion to Dismiss, the District responds that the Board lacks
jurisdiction to consider a protest regarding a grant application. The Board agrees with the
District and dismisses the protest. Protester's applications were submitted pursuant to an RFA
for subgrants of Federal grant funds administered by the District of Columbia. Had the
protester's application been successful, it would have resulted in a grant award and not a contract.
The Procurement Practices Act establishes and limits the Board’s jurisdiction to be “consistent
with the coverage of … [the PPA] as defined in 2-301.04 and 2-303.20 .…” D.C. Code § 2-
309.03(b) (2001 ed.). Section 2-301.04(b) specifically excludes from the PPA’s coverage, and
therefore from the Board's jurisdiction, any "contract or agreement receiving or making grants-
in-aid or for federal financial assistance." Since this matter relates to award of a grant, the Board
is without jurisdiction. District of Columbia Local Development Corporation, CAB No. P-0421,
Nov. 14, 1994, 42 D.C. Reg. 4885, holding affirmed, but vacated on other grounds, Jan. 31,
1995, 42 D.C. Reg. 4914.

       We DISMISS the protest for lack of jurisdiction.

       SO ORDERED.
