PROTEST OF:
      GNIJ ENTERPRISE, INC.
                                                     CAB No. P-73

     opinion by Administrative Judge David D. Marlin and Booker
and Davis concurring.
                                       OPINION
      In   1987,    the       Department   of    Public   and   Assisted    Housing
(DPAH) ,    formerly      a    part   of   the    Department    of   Housing       and
Community     Development,        issued   two     solicitations,     one    for     a
courier service to provide a daily collection of rental receipts
and deposits, 1        and the second to produce and install external
signs to be mounted at various public housing projects. 2
     GNIJ Enterprises, Inc.           (GNIJ) submitted sealed bids for both
procurements.       The bid for the courier service was rejected by
DPAH as nonresponsive sometime in October, 1987;3 the bid for the

installation of signs was rejected by a letter dated October 8,

1987, according to the supplement to the agency report filed on
June 24, 1988. 4

     lIFB 4904-73-Al-87, issued on July 28, 1987.
     2IFB 4854-72-Al-87, issued on May 11, 1987.
     3The record does not contain the rejection notification, but
the basis for the rejection is undisputed.
     4This rejection letter also is not in the record.                     The date
of its receipt by GNIJ is unknown.
                                                 -    2 -

       GNIJ   filed    its protest with the Board covering both bids
rejections on october 27, 1987. 5
                                          PROCEDURE
       Before turning to the merits of the protest,                                      there is a
pending    motion     by    GNIJ,        filed       on March          29,     1988,      to   impose
sanctions against the District, and another motion by GNIJ for
summary disposition of the case,                      filed on June 13, 1988.                     Both
motions are based on the                 failure of the District to file                             its
agency report within the required time frame.
       The District's responses to the protest were well beyond the
time limit suggested in the proposed Board rules published on
September     12,    1986    in     33   D.C.        Reg.      5671,    which required,               in
subsection 302.1, a response no later than 20 working days of the
time   DPAH    received      notification             that GNIJ' s            protest had         been
filed with the Board.
       A   telephone       conference       calIon             March         14,    1988,      and    in
written    pleadings        filed    on    March          18    and June           24,    1988,      the
District argued against sanctions or a                           summary disposition in
GNIJ's     favor,     respectively.                  In     essence,         the    District         has
conceded      that    staff       errors,        neglect         and         inadvertence         were


     5This case originated during the period when the District of
Columbia Contract Appeals Board was functioning pursuant to
commissioner's Order No.9, D.C. Code, Supplement V (1987), as
amended by Mayor's Order 86-65, 33 DCR 3006 (May 16, 1986).
Pursuant to the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985 (PPA),
D.C.  Code, sec. 1-1189.1 (1987), a new independent agency
denominated as the Contract Appeals Board was created. This new
Board became operational on August 1, 1988, and succeeded to the
jurisdiction of all cases pending before the previously
established Board.

responsible        but   argues      that   the    remedies        sought     by    GNIJ    are
inappropriate because GNIJ I S              case has not been prejudiced,                   the
District acted in good faith once its neglect was discovered and
the period of untimeliness was not prolonged.
        Imposition of sanctions, or disposing of a case by summary
judgement without regard to the merits of the controversy,                                  are
extraordinary actions that rest fully within the discretion of
the Board.         Although we do not condone the government's failure
to respond promptly to the protest,                     we decline to enforce the
penalties requested by GNIJ.
        We   are    principally       influenced        by   the     candidness      of     the
government, the lack of prejudice to the protester with respect
to    its    sUbstantive    positions        and    the      ancient      tradition        that
favors disposition of litigation on its merits.                           Different facts
and     circumstances,          of    course,      could      lead       to   an    opposite
conclusion if similar egregious responsiveness was present.
        Accordingly,      the    motion     for    sanction and the motion                  for
summary disposition are DENIED.
                                     COURIER SERVICE
        DPAH solicited bids on July 28, 1987 for a courier service,
which    included a      vehicle containing a                safe and communications
equipment,     to pick up rental collections at 41 public housing
projects between 8:30 a.m. and 4:15 p.m., Monday through Friday.
      When    the    bids were        opened on August             31,    1987,    GNIJ had
submitted a bid of $49,200, the third lowest.                         See Agency Report
filed on March 18, 1988, pages 1-2.                      On October 9,            1987, DPAH
                                             -   4 -

requested the opportunity to inspect the service vehicle offered
by GNIJ,      and the parties conferred on October 13 to set a time
and place for the inspection.                    See affidavit of Gregory Sims,
attached to the agency report.
        According to the Sims affidavit, which is undisputed, GNIJ
agreed to an October 15 inspection but subsequently declined to
present the vehicle.           Through its president, Gerald Iverson, Jr.,
GNIJ,    in a letter dated October 14, 1987,                    stated it would not
agree to an inspection of its vehicle unless it was regarded as
the "lowest responsible bidder", exh. C, Agency Report.
        The   refusal    to     permit      DPAH   to     examine   the    vehicle    to
determine      whether        the    safe    and       communications     system   were
adequate resulted in the determination that the GNIJ' s bid was
nonresponsive.      Subsections 2620.13, 2620.13B2 and 2620.13B2H of
the Materiel Management Manual               (July 1, 1974) provide authority
for rejection of bids that modify requirements of an IFB and fail

to conform to material requirements of the procurement.
        The   finding    of    nonresponsiveness           is   justified under      the
facts    and circumstances.            The protest relating to the courier
service procurement is DENIED.
                                    SIGN INSTALLATION
        No facts are in dispute.
        DPAH solicited bids on May 11, 1987 for the fabrication and
installation of exterior surface mounted signs at various public
housing properties.           When bids were opened on July 10, 1987, GNIJ
had submitted the third lowest bid.                      The three lowest bidders
                                                   -   5 -

were requested to submit documentation to show the cost breakdown
of their bids and did so.                       The GNIJ submission raised its bid
from $78,350 to $150,000, which was approximately four times the
amount      of       the   successful           bidder       who    received   the   contract
following        a    responsibility            determination.           See Agency Report
dated June 24,             1988 at pages 1-2 and Recommendation Memorandum
attached.
         GNIJ's protest, in relevant part, is as follows:
         with reference to Sign Project I was contacted to
         submit Cost Break Down for the proposal.   I submitted
         by certified mail then to find out that I was not the
         recipient of the award.  The question that arose in my
         mind was why did DHCD contact my Company and what
         procedures were they following in awarding this
         contract.   Did they just pull my company and name at
         random or were they starting from the lowest bid then
         working up the ladder of quoted bids.      The process
         seemed improper with no guidelines.
         The protest of GNIJ only questions the procedures followed
by DPAH.         The agency report supplement,                       submitted on June 24,
1988,      responds         to         these    procedural         inquiries   and   does   so
satisfactorily.               We also note that GNIJ did not file comments
contesting           DPAH's      explanation.            Accordingly,      the   protest    is
DENIED.
