                                             OPINION
                                      Courtlink Filing ID 683921

        Protester, M&G Services, Inc., has protested against award to the apparent low bidder,
Forney Enterprises, Inc., alleging that Forney does not have the equipment to perform the work. The
District has moved to dismiss the protest on the ground that M&G is not a certified small business
enterprise (“SBE”) and therefore lacks standing to protest the award of a contract set aside for small
businesses. M&G has not responded to the motion. Because M&G is not a certified SBE, it was not
eligible to bid on this set-aside procurement and therefore lacks standing to protest. Accordingly,
we dismiss its protest.

                                         BACKGROUND

        On February 21, 2002, the Office of Contracting and Procurement (“OCP”) issued IFB No.
POAM 2002-B-0006-AE for site work at 401 Farragut Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. (Ex. 1). OCP
set aside the IFB for certified SBEs by checking block 6 on page 1 of the solicitation and including
the SBE set-aside clauses in Section M of the solicitation. (Ex. 1). On March 8, 2002, five bidders,
including M&G and Forney, submitted bids in response to the IFB. (Ex. 3). M&G is not certified as
an SBE by the Local Business Opportunity Commission (“LBOC”). (Exs. 3, 5). On March 12,
2002, M&G filed its protest challenging the award to Forney. The District awarded a letter contract
to Forney on March 26, 2002. (Ex. 4). On March 27, 2002, the Chief Procurement Officer signed a
“Determination and Findings to Proceed with Award After Receipt of a Protest” which was filed
with the Board on April 1, 2002.

                                           DISCUSSION

       An entity which is not certified by the LBOC as a small business is not eligible for award of
a contract in the small business set-aside market and thus lacks standing to protest an award.
Maryland Construction, Inc., CAB No. P-0650, Jan. 17, 2002, 13 P.D. 8218; J&K Distributors, Inc.
                                               -2-                   M&G Services, Inc., CAB No. P-0652



of Washington, D.C., CAB No. P-0432, June 13, 1995, 42 D.C. Reg. 4986, 4988. Because there is
no dispute that M&G is not a certified SBE, it lacks standing to protest an award. Accordingly, the
protest is dismissed.

       SO ORDERED.
