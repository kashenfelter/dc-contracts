                                         Filing ID 26493845


        Corinthian Contractors, Inc., the apparent low bidder under a solicitation for certain
reconstruction work on Pennsylvania Avenue, SE, has protested the contracting officer’s
decision to reduce its bid amount for mobilization to the maximum amount permitted by section
612.02 of the Standard Specifications for Highways and Structures which was incorporated into
the solicitation. We conclude that the contracting officer was required by the terms of the
solicitation to reduce Corinthian’s bid amount for mobilization to the maximum permitted by
section 612.02 of the Standard Specifications. If Corinthian believed that the solicitation
contained an unreasonably low mobilization maximum, it should have brought that issue to the
attention of the contracting officer prior to bid opening. Accordingly, we deny the protest.

                                      BACKGROUND

        On May 4, 2009, the District’s Department of Transportation (“DDOT”) Invitation for
Bids (“IFB”) No. DCKA-2009-B-0090 was advertised in the Washington Times and posted on
the Office of Contracting and Procurement (“OCP”) website. (Agency Report (“AR”) Ex. 1).
The IFB was for the reconstruction of Pennsylvania Avenue, SE, from 200 Feet West of 27th
Street, SE, to Southern Avenue, SE. (Id.). From May 6, 2009, to June 10, 2009, five
amendments were issued to the IFB, none having any bearing on this protest. On June 12, 2009,
bids were received and opened from six bidders with the evaluated bids with Certified Business
Enterprise preferences adjusted as follows:

       Name:                                                  Total Bid:

       1. Corinthian Contractors, Inc.        -               $23,464,629.65
       2. Fort Myer Construction Corp.        -               $25,182,540.26
       3. Civil Construction, LLC.            -               $25,582,048.70
       4. Capitol Paving of DC, Inc.          -               $27,332,237.90
       5. Rustler Construction, Inc.          -               $29,676,271.49
       6. Tompkins Builders, Inc.             -               $29,968,820.96
                                                 -2-          Corinthian Contractors, CAB No. P-0812


        On June 15, 2009, the contracting officer certified and signed a tabulation of the bids.
(AR Ex. 2). On June 16, 2009, the contracting officer sent a letter (AR Ex 3) to Corinthian
indicating that the contracting officer had discovered a mathematical error in Corinthian’s bid
regarding mobilization and that the bid amount of $2,653,310.00 for mobilization had been
adjusted to the allowed maximum amount of $1,203,231.48 as required by section 612.02 of the
Measure and Payment portion of DDOT’s Standard Specifications for Highways and Structures
2005 (Revised 2007), which is incorporated into the IFB (Appendices Index, at ii (AR Ex. 1, Part
4)). Section 612.02 provides in relevant part:

       Payment for Mobilization will be made at the contract lump sum price, subject to
       allowable limits under this section, which payment will include all operations and
       expense needed to mobilize, remobilize and demobilize. Lump sum price for
       Mobilization shall not exceed applicable amounts determined as follows:

       Original Contract Total                Maximum Lump Sum
       Including Mobilization                 for Mobilization
       More Than To and Incl.

       $0              $200,000               10% of Contract Total
       $200,000        1,000,000              $20,000 plus 7.5% (of
                                              Contract Total minus $200,000)
       $1,000,000                             $80,000 plus 5% (of
                                              Contract Total minus $1,000,000)

       If the lump sum shown in the Pay Item Schedule for any bid for Mobilization
       exceeds the allowable amount shown in the table above, the District reserves the
       right to adjust the amount and total bid accordingly when checking bids. Said
       adjustment will in no way invalidate bids. . . .

(AR Ex. 7). The contracting officer informed Corinthian that the total price of its bid had been
adjusted from $23,464,629.65 down to $22,014,551.13. The letter requested that Corinthian
acknowledge the changes by signing the letter and returning a signed copy to the contracting
officer. (AR Ex. 3). Corinthian did not sign the letter acknowledging the adjustment, and by
letter of the same date, took exception to the revised price for mobilization and to the adjustment
to the total contract price. (AR Ex. 4). Corinthian argued that since the project was being
funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, federal requirements supersede the
cited District requirements. On June 17, the contracting officer sent a letter to Corinthian
requesting responsibility data. (AR Ex. 5). On June 18, 2009, the contracting officer received a
second letter from Corinthian, arguing that the price adjustment was unfair and that it could not
perform the contract for the adjusted price. (AR Ex. 4(a)). On June 23, 2009, Corinthian
provided the responsibility data to the contracting officer. (AR Ex. 6). On June 25, 2009,
Corinthian filed this protest with the Board challenging the mobilization price reduction and the
overall contract price reduction. Corinthian requests that the District be required either to accept
the original bid price or permit Corinthian to adjust the bid by reducing the mobilization amount
and commensurately increasing other line items in its bid. Fort Myer intervened on June 30,
2009. On July 15, 2009, the District filed its Agency Report, and filed a determination and
                                                  -3-          Corinthian Contractors, CAB No. P-0812


finding to proceed with contract performance on July 24, 2009. Corinthian thereafter filed
comments on the Agency Report.


                                               DISCUSSION

          We exercise jurisdiction over this protest pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03 (a)(1).

        The sole issue presented is Corinthian’s contention that the District had discretion not to
reduce the mobilization price and that the contracting officer’s decision to reduce Corinthian’s
bid price was arbitrary and capricious. Corinthian contends that the following standard
specification provision provides the contracting officer with discretion in deciding whether to
reduce the contract price due to an excessive mobilization bid:

          If the lump sum shown in the Pay Item Schedule for any bid for Mobilization
          exceeds the allowable amount shown in the table above, the District reserves the
          right to adjust the amount and total bid accordingly when checking bids. Said
          adjustment will in no way invalidate bids.

(AR Ex 7). (emphasis added). Citing D.C. Code § 2-301.01, Corinthian states that the
Procurement Practices Act requires that the procurement law should “be liberally construed to
promote its underlying purposes and policies” and that penalizing the low bidder by reducing the
bid amount is contrary to public policy. Corinthian argues that the contracting officer should
have considered whether the bid presented an “undue risk” to the government.

          We disagree with Corinthian. The standard specification mobilization price limitation
states:

          Payment for Mobilization will be made at the contract lump sum price, subject to
          allowable limits under this section, which payment will include all operations and
          expense needed to mobilize, remobilize and demobilize. Lump sum price for
          Mobilization shall not exceed applicable amounts determined as follows . . . .

(AR Ex. 3). (emphasis added). This standard, using “shall” and not “may”, provides the
contracting officer no discretion to accept a higher mobilization price. The portion of section
612.02 cited by Corinthian merely gives the contracting officer the right to adjust the
mobilization bid item after bid opening in connection with award. Corinthian has not
demonstrated that any federal provision expressly supersedes or contradicts the provisions found
in section 612.02. Accordingly, Corinthian’s reliance on the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act is misplaced.

        The adjustment requested by Corinthian, adding the excess mobilization amount to other
line items after bid opening has been specifically considered and rejected by the Board in
Corman Construction, Inc., P-0217, 39 D.C. Reg. 4235 (1991). In that matter, Corman made an
arithmetical error in calculating the appropriate amount of mobilization, pursuant to the then-
governing section 104.07(C) of the District of Columbia Department of Highways and Traffic
Standard Specifications for Highways and Structures (1974). The language of section 104.07(C)
                                               -4-          Corinthian Contractors, CAB No. P-0812


essentially mirrors that of the current section 612.02 of the DDOT Standard Specifications for
Highways and Structures. Corman contended that the error should be corrected by maintaining
the total bid amount and increasing other items to make up for the reduction of the excess
amount from the mobilization item. The Board held that the interpretation used by the District
was correct, that “the mistake may be corrected by decreasing the total bid by the excess amount
in the Mobilization item”, denied the protest, and permitted Corman to withdraw its bid.

                                       CONCLUSION

        The solicitation clearly limited the mobilization amount and provided the contracting
officer the right to adjust the mobilization bid item to the maximum allowable amount. The
contracting officer’s action was consistent with the solicitation and the law. Accordingly, we
deny the protest.

       SO ORDERED.
