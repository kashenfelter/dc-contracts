                              ORDER

     Notice of Appeal in CAB No. 0-918 was filed on M~y 22, 1992,
and the District's answer was filed on July 9, 1992. 1 A line of
dismissal was filed by the Lab School of Washington on December
28, 1992.  The District's response thereto was filed on December
31, 1992, and in it the District states that while it has no
objection to the dismissal,      the dismissal should be with
prejudice.

     Pursuant to Board Rule 121.1, an appellant is entitled by
right to a voluntary dismissal or dismissal without prejudice only
where an answer has not been filed or where there is a joint
stipulation signed by each party.     36 OCR 2697.  In the instant
appeal, the answer has been filed and the defendant opposes
dismissal without prejudice. Under these circumstances, the Board
must approve the dismissal, " . . . upon terms and conditions as it
deems proper. II  Board Rule 121.2, 36 OCR 2697.       Taking into
account the procedural posture of this case and the District's
opposition to dismissal without prejudice, the Board finds it
appropriate that the case be DISMISSED, with prejudice.
     So ORDERED.
