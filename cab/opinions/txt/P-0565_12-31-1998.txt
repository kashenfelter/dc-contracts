       2. I received a memorandum dated October 8, 1998, from Leslie A. Hotaling the

Administrator of the Solid Waste Management Administration of the Department of Public

Works. (Ex. 9, Agency Report). The Administrator stated in her memorandum that Rodgers

Brothers Custodial Services, Inc. (Rodgers) was in violation of the Solid Waste Facility Permit

Law (Solid Waste Law) and was being sued by the District.

       3. On October 15, 1998, I determined that Rodgers was nonresponsible in that Rodgers

did not possess the requisite integrity and business ethics as required by law because of its failure

to comply with the Solid Waste Law. (Ex. 10, Agency Report).

       4. On October 15, 1998, I determined that Waste Management, Inc. was responsible. (Ex.

                                              OPINION

         Rodgers Brothers Custodial Services, Inc. ("Rodgers" or "Protester") protests the Department of
Public Works' Determination and Finding that it was a non-responsible contractor for performance of an
emergency procurement for the collection and di~posal of residential yard waste. Rodgers, the low bidder,
contends that the Contracting Officer lacked a reasonable basis for the non-responsibility determination.
The Protester also asserts that the Contracting Officer failed to consider similar allegations against the
second low bidder and that this is evidence of bad faith. Rodgers' protest is denied in part and dismissed
in part.

                                          BACKGROUND

         On September 22, 1998, the Department of Public Works ("DPW") issued IFB No. 98-0213-
AA-OMS-TS, seeking bids for curbside biweekly collection and disposal of yard waste for Wards 1
through 8, designated as Items 1 through 8. (Agency Report ("AR"), Ex. 3, at. 3). DPW issued
Addendum No.1 on September 30, 1998, establishing the dates of collection beginning October 26, 1998
through the week ofJanuary 15,1999. 1 (Id.). DPW received bids on October 2, 1998 from Rodgers,
the apparent lowest bidder at $577,840 ($124 per ton) for Items 1 through 8, from Waste Management
Inc., the second low bidder at $615,120 ($132 per ton) for Items 1 through 8, and from C&H Trucking,



        IOn November 4, 1998, the Chief Procurement Officer filed a Determination and Findings to
Proceed with Contract Performance. The Protester challenged the Determination and Findings on
November 12, 1998. The District filed its Response on November 16, 1998. On November 18,
1998, the Board denied Protester's Motion Challenging the Director's Determination to Proceed With
Contract Performance. Accordingly, the contract performance dates were delayed by approximately
three weeks.

                                                            Rodgers Bros CustodlGl Services, Inc, CAB No P-565

who bid $210,000 for Items 1,2, and 8. (AR, Ex. 4).

         On October 6, 1998, DPW' s Contracting Officer requested Rodgers to supply the agency with
general responsibility information. (Protest, Ex. 1 and AR, Ex. 7). On October 9, 1998, in response to the
District's request, Rodgers submitted documentation pertaining to its financial resources and status;
information about current and recently expired contracts relative to the collection of waste; information
about its equipment, personnel and facilities; an analysis ofhow Rodgers intended to perform the collection
services; and copies of its solid waste collector's licenses and copies ofthe licenses of its drivers. (AR,
Ex. 8). By letter dated October 16, 1998, DPW' s Contracting Officer informed Rodgers that DPW would
not award the contract to it because: "[t]his office has determined your company non-responsible for failing
to meetthe requirements of D.C. Law 11-94, 'Solid Waste Facility Permit Act of1995' (SWFPA)."
(Protest, Ex. 2). On October 16, 1998, the Contracting Officer signed a Determination and Findings of
Non-Responsibility ("D&F"), which provides:

        Section 3 of D.C. Law 11-94, "Solid Waste Facility Permit Act of 1995," (SWAPA)
        prohibits the operation of open solid waste facilities. Section 6 of D.C. Law 11-94,
        requires owners and operators of solid waste facilities to submit periodic reports. Section
        8 ... requires the payment of a solid waste facility charge based upon the actual tonnage
        of solid waste deposited at the solid waste facility at the rate of $4.00 per ton.

        [Rodgers] has not filed any reports with the Department of Public Works, Solid Waste
        Management Administration, the agency responsible for administering the SWFPA of
        1995 since the law became effective on February 27, 1996. For the aforementioned
        reasons, the Department ofConsumer and Regulatory [Affairs] is currently in litigation with
        [Rodgers] to enforce the provisions ofthe SWFP A of 1995 pursuant to the provisions of
        D.C. Law 11-118, "Clean Hands Before Receiving a License or Permit Act of 1996."

(Protest, Ex. 3 and AR, Ex. 10).

        The Contracting Officer determined that Rodgers lacked a satisfactory record of integrity and
business ethics based on its failure to comply with the provisions of SWFP A. (See 27 DCMR §
2200.4(d)). The Contrac~ing Officer based the Non-Responsibility D&F on a one-page memorandum,
dated October 8, 1998, from the Administrator of the Solid Waste Management Administration
("SWMA") ofDPW, who advised the Contracting Officer that Rodgers was operating a solid waste facility
in the District in violation ofthe SWFPA. (AR, Ex. 9). The SWFPA requires each owner/operator of a
waste handling facility to report to DPW the number oftons ofmaterial the facility receives on a monthly
basis, and to pay a facility fee for each ton ofDistrict~generated waste received. (Id.). !he SWMA
Administrator informed DPW that Rodgers had not reported the amount of waste received or paid the solid
waste fee since the initiation of the process in August of 1996. The memorandum also reported that the
District had filed suit against Rodgers for violating the SWFPA.

                                                             Rodgers Bros Custodwl Services. Inc. CAB No. P-565

        In a Determination & Findings signed on October 15, 1998, the Contracting Officer determined
that Waste Management was responsible. (AR, Ex. 12). On October 16, 1998, the Chief Procurement
Officer approved the Contracting Officer's Determination and Findings to award the contract to Waste
Management, the next lowest bidder. (AR, Ex. 11).

        Rodgers filed its protest on October 21, 1998 asserting: (1) that the Contracting Officer lacked a
reasonable basis for determining Rodgers non-responsible; and (2) that Waste Management had similar
violations ofthe SWFPA and should have also been found to be non-responsible Rodgers concludes that
the Contracting Officer's affirmative fmding ofresponsibility for Waste Management underscores the lack
of a reasonable basis in the Contracting Officer's finding of non-responsibility for Rodgers. In its
Comments on the Agency Report filed on November 25, 1998, Rodgers asserted for the first time that this
alleged dissimilar treatment demonstrated bad faith on the part of DPW.

                                              DISCUSSION

        We exercise protest jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1189.3 (Supp. 1998).

        I. Timeliness of Bad Faith Allegation

         While not addressed by the District, the Board finds as a preliminary matter that the protester's
allegation of bad faith was untimely raised. Rodgers original protest asserts as evidence that the
Contracting Officer's determination lacked a reasonable basis the alleged dissimilar treatment of Rodgers
and Waste Management. (Protest, at 4). In its Response to the Agency Report, Rodgers asserts for the
first time that the alleged dissimilar treatment is evidence of bad faith. Protests based upon matters other
than improprieties in a solicitation must be filed with the Board not later than ten business days after the
basis of the protest is known or should have been known. (Board Rule 302.2, 45 D.C. Reg. 1415 (March
13, 1998)). The Board is without j urisdiction to decide matters that are filed beyond the 1O-day time
period. See, e.g. Good Food Services, Inc. CAB No. P-457, Aug. 27, 1996,44 D.C. Reg. 7147.
Generally, the timeliness of an additional bases of protest raised after the filing of a timely initial protest
depends upon the relationship that the later-raised bases bear to the initial protest. See Vinnell Corp., B-
270793.2, Apr. 24, 1996,96-1 cpp ~ 271. Where the later bases present new and independent grounds
for protest, they must independently satisfy our timeliness requirements. Conversely, where the later
contentions merely provide additional support for an earlier timely raised objection, we consider these
additional arguments. See GE Government Services, B-235101, Aug. 11,1989,89-2 CPD ~ 128. The
allegation of bad faith by the protester is a new and independent ground of protest, rather than additional
support for the earlier protest contentions. The concept of bad faith is not embodied in the protester's
challenge to the reasonableness ofthe Contracting Officer's determination. Since Protester's allegation
of bad faith was not raised until November 25, 1998, more than one month after the filing ofits original
protest, it is untimely, and we are without jurisdiction to decide it. Accordingly, the issue of bad faith is
dismissed with prejudice.

         II. Reasonableness of Responsibility Determination

         While there is no presumption of agency correctness under our de novo standard of review, we
accord contracting officers broad discretion in the exercise oftheir duty to determine whether a prospective
contractor is responsible. See e.g. Kidd International Home Care Services, Inc., CAB No. P-547,
Sept. 15, 1998,45 D. C. Reg. 8835; Central Armature/Fort Myer, CAB No. P-478, Jun. 6, 1997,44
D. C. Reg. 6823; Aceco, LLC, CAB No. P-486, July 23, 1997,44 D.C. Reg. 6852; Dixon Pest Control
Services, Inc., CAB No. P-410, Apr.6, 1994,42 D. C Reg. 4528; c.P.F. Corp., CAB No. P-413,
Nov.l8, 1994,42 D.C. Reg. 4902. Since the contracting officer must bear the brunt of any difficulties in
obtaining the required performance, we will not disturb an affirmative responsibility determination unless
the protester demonstrates a failure by a prospective contractor to adhere to definitive responsibility
criteria, fraud or bad faith on the part ofthe contracting officials, or that the responsibility determination
lacks any reasonable basis. HR. General Maintenance Corp, Inc., CAB No. P-557, Feb 2, 1999, 10
P.D.7658.

        In arguing that the DPW Contracting Officer had no reasonable basis on which to find Rodgers
non-responsible, the Protester states that the "D&F contains only one real' finding' of a supposed legal
violation by Rodgers Brothers-that Rodgers Brothers has not filed any periodic reports required by the
SWFP A." (Protester's Comments on Agency Report, at 3). Rodgers argues that it has regularly filed
reports pursuant to a 1993 Consent Order, and that the District has never informed Rodgers that the
reports were unsatisfactory. (Id) The Protester also asserts that the October 8, 1998, one-page
memorandum from the Administrator ofthe SWMA, which the Contracting Officer relied upon, contained
erroneous information itself and was further misinterpreted by the Contracting Officer. The Protester states:

         Citing to both the SWFP A's requirement to file reports oftonnage and then to SWFP A's
         requirement to pay a fee on each ton reported, the Administrator stated that Rodgers
         Brothers has not complied with 'this provision.' It is not clear whether 'this provision
         refers to the payment of the fee based on reported quantities or the reporting requirement
         itself. In either case, the one page memorandum contained inaccuracies.
(Id.).

         Rodgers observes that the D&F incorrectly refers to D.C. Law 11-118, "Clean Hands Before
Receiving a License or Permit Act of 1996," rather than the SWFPA, as the basis ofthe Superior Court
suit. (Id). Noting that the District's Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order in the Superior Court suit
was denied, Rodgers argues that the lawsuit allegations are not facts upon which the Contracting Officer
could reasonably base his D&F. (Id). Based on these various purported defects and errors in the D&F
and the one-page memorandum, Rodgers charges that the non-responsibility determination is not based
on substantial evidence and lacks a reasonable basis.

        Despite the errors cited by the Protester, we find that the record contains substantial evidence
establishing that the Contracting Officer's determination of non-responsibility was reasonable. The one-
                                                                                                                        ~   ,,

page memorandum from the Administrator ofSWMA provided the Contracting Officer with adequate
reason to determined that Rodgers had violated the SWFPA by failing to file reports concerning the amount
of waste it had collected and failing to pay fees for the processed waste. Furthermore, the D&F was
based on a document from the SWMA Administrator-the person'responsible for all solid waste collection
for the District. The Contracting Officer had ample justification to place great weight on the one-page
memorandum, and was not required to further investigate the reports ofnon-compliance with the reporting
and payment requirements ofS WFP A. Although the D&F is not well written and in fact contains glaring
errors, it adequately conveys a reasonable basis for finding Rodger's non-responsible.

       The record also fails to support Rodgers claim of dissimilar treatment. Based on conversations with
the Administrator ofS WMA and Waste Management's response to DPW' s responsibility inquiry, the
Contracting Officer found Waste Management responsible and in compliance with the Solid Waste laws.
(See "Affidavit ofthe District of Columbia in Response to the Affidavit of George Rodgers, Jr."). DPW's
fmding ofresponsibility for Waste Management is not a demonstqltion of dissimilar treatment and does not
support Rodgers' claim that the Contracting Officer had no reasonable basis to find Rodgers non- '
responsible. This protest ground is denied.

        Accordingly, the protest is dismissed in part and denied in part.
