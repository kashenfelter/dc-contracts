                         OPINION AND ORDER ON DISTRICT'S
                                MOTION TO DISMISS


Procedural History

         The instant protest was filed with the Board on July 22, 1994. American Medical
Laboratories, Inc. ("Protestor" or "AML") alleged that emergency Solicitation No. JA/94671
for the performance of urine testing services for the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services
Administration of the Department of Human Services (" ADASA It) had been awarded to B & W
Stat Laboratories, Inc. ("B & WIt). Further, Protestor alleged that the purported awardee was
not a "NIDA approved laboratory as listed in the Federal Register") as was required by
Question #1 of the solicitation. Exhibit 1, Motion to Dismiss. AML stated that, at the time of
the filing, it was the incumbent provider of these testing services.

      Protestor requests "relief of this award and that due consideration be given to American
Medical Laboratories for the continuation of the services that we have provided. "

       The Board sent its notice of tiling of protest to the parties on July 26', 1994.


    ) Protestor attached a single page from the Notice section of the Federal Register that
appears to be an incomplete copy of the "Current List of Laboratories Which Meet Minimum
Standards To Engage In Urine Drug Testing For Federal Agencies And Laboratories That Have
Withdrawn From The Program" (59 Fed. Reg. 34850 (July 7, 1994)).
                                                                                                     ---------
                                                                                                                 -----

                                                      -   2 -         CAB No. P-414, American Medical Lahs.




                 On August 19, 1994, the Board received a response to the protest from the purported
         awardee or an interested party, B & W. Board Rule 304,36 OCR 2712 (April 21, 1989). In
         its response, B & W stated that it had been orally notified by an employee of the contracting
         section of the Department of Human Services ("DHS") that B & W was the ·successful bidder
         for Solicitation No. JA/94671 and that a letter confirming B & W's contractual relationship with
         a NIDA-certified laboratory was needed to complete their contract file. B & W stated that this
         letter had been provided and deemed acceptable by DHS and that B & W was to sign the
         contract documents.

                On August 29, 1994, in lieu of an agency report, the District filed a motion to dismiss
         on the ground that, in light of the fact that no responsibility determination has been made and
         no contract has been executed, AML is not an aggrieved party. Board Rule 306,36 DCR 2713
         (1989). The District bases its motion on D.C. Code ~ 1-1189.3 (Rep!. 1992), Board Rules
         300.1 and 300.2 (36 OCR 2710 (1989)), and an analysis of the Board's decision. in Dixon Pest
         Control, Inc., CAB No. P-371, May 17, 1994, 41 OCR 3428.

                 To date, Protestor has not filed a response to the District's Motion to Dismiss.
         Protestor's failure to file a response within seven (7) days of the motion's filing may, at the
         Board's discretion, result in the dismi~sa1 of the protest or the .Board's disregard of factual
         allegations that are not admitted by the DistriCt. See Board Rule 307, 36 OCR 2713 - 2714
         (1989).


         Statement of Facts 2

                  On July 6, 1994, DHS issued emergency Solicitation No. JA/94671 for urine testing
         services for ADASA. DHS transmitted via facsimile the solicitation to seven vendors. The
         cover letter to the solicitation advised the vendors that responses were due by July 8, 1994. The
         solicitation was for an emergency procurement for a period of 120 days. By July 8, 1994, DHS
         had received four responses to the solicitation, including responses from B & Wand AML.

                 Contrary to Protestor's allegation, 0 HS has not yet awarded an emergency contract for
         urine testing services for ADASA. At this time, the District has stated that it is unknown when
         such a contract will be awarded.




             2 As previously stated, in light of the Protestor's failure to reply to the District's Motion

         to Dismiss, the Board has accepted the District's uncontroverted statement of facts.
                                                                                              [5984]



                                             -   3 -         CAB No. P-414, American Medical Labs.




Decision

        The Procurement Practices Act ("PPA") establishes the Board's jurisdiction over protests
as follows:


       The Board shall be the exclusive hearing tribunal for, and shall have jurisdiction
       to review and determine de novo:

               (1) Any protest of a solicitation or award of a contract ... by any
               actual or prospective bickler or offeror ... who is aggrieved     II1
               connection with the solicitation or aware! of a contract ....

D.C. Code § 1-1189.3 (Rep!. 1992) ..

       The Board's Rules, which are intended to implement the PPA, are very specific
concerning the Board's jurisciiction. Board Rule 300 sets the following parameters:

       300.1          An aggrieved person may protest to the Board a
                      solicitation issued by or for a District department or
                      agency for the procurement of property or services,
                      or a proposed award, or the award of such a
                      contract.

       300.2          For purposes of this chapter, an aggrieved person
                      means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror
                      who has suffered a loss or injury or has had a legal
                      right violated as a result of adverse agency action.

36 DCR 2710 (1989).

       Thus, the Boarci has held that a protest is only viable if the protestor has been wronged
by agency action. In Group Insurance Administration, CAB No. P-354, February 2, 1993, 40
DCR 4933, the Board provided an in-depth discussion of the meaning of the term "aggrieved
party." In its discussion of Micro Computer Company, Inc., CAB No. P-226, January 9, 1992,
39 DCR 4381, the Board observed the following:

               [T]he Board clearly stated [in Micro] that it has jurisdiction over protests
       filed both prior to and after contract aware!. However, the protest must involve
       the solicitation process, i.e. actions taken which lead up to and include award of
       a contract.
                                                                                                              ------
[5985]




                                                       - 4 -           CAB No. P-414, Amencan Medical Labs.




         40 DCR 4936, fnt. 4.

                 In Dixon Pest Control, the Board took this analysis further:

                          The Board has held consistently that in order for there to be a viable
                 protest, a bidder must be aggrieved by agency action. Further, in order for a
                 party to be aggrieved, there must be some showing of actual or threatened injury
                 in fact.

                        Under the facts of the instant matter, it is clear that Dixon is not properly
                 aggrieved for the purpose of our jurisdiction, in that no determination of
                 responsibility has been made, and no award has been made. Thus, at best,
                 protestor's challenge is speculative and premature. (citations omitted).

         41 DCR at 3428 - 3429.

                In the case at bar, as in Dixon, the District has not yet made a responsibility
         determination and has not yet awarded the emergency contract at issue.

                 The interested party has asserted that it was scheduled to sign the contract documents,
         but had not yet done so as of August 115, 1994. Despite 13 & W's assertions, no proof has been
         submitted to the Board by the interested party (or the Protestor, for that matter) regarding DHS'
         actions or determinations. The Board is unable to make decisions based solely upon the
         assertions of counselor company representatives. The Board requires evidence of proof. See
         Executive Security & Engineering Technologies, Inc., CAB No. P-399, June 22, 1994, 7 P.D.
         5879. In sum, the evidence of record does not establish "actual or threatened injury in fact."
         Dixon Pest Control, 41 DCR at 3428. In light of the foregoing, the Protestor is not an
         aggrieved party and the instant action is premature.


                 Therefore, based upon the facts, legal precedent and reasoning as set forth above, this
         protest is DISMISSED, without prejudice.
