                                          OPINION
                                       Filing ID 15938473


        In an April 23, 2007 letter, received and docketed at the Board on April 27, 2007,
protester GiniCorp challenges the award to Tandem Conglomerate, LLC (“Tandem”) of a
contract for resources and staff to maintain a program within the District of Columbia Public
Schools (“DCPS”) called “DC STARS.” The District filed its initial Agency Report on June
11, 2007, more than 20 days late. After substitution of counsel, the District filed a combined
motion to dismiss and supplemental Agency Report on July 11, 2007. DCPS asserts that the
Board should dismiss the protest because DCPS’s contracting officer informed GiniCorp’s
executive, Mr. Michael Masters, in January 2007 that DCPS had decided to exclude GiniCorp
from the competitive range, and GiniCorp did not file its protest until April 27, 2007. We
agree with DCPS that GiniCorp’s protest was filed long after it was informed of its exclusion
from the competition. Accordingly, we deny the protest.

                                     BACKGROUND

        DCPS issued solicitation No. GAGA 2007-I-0012 in November 2006, for the
procurement of information technology services and consulting in the implementation of the
DC STARS student records information system. Three offerors (GiniCorp, Tandem, and
Tecknomic) submitted timely proposals on November 20, 2006. A technical evaluation panel
examined the proposals. In December 2006, the panel determined that GiniCorp’s proposal
was technically unacceptable, containing numerous deficiencies, and that it should not be
included in the competitive range. The contracting officer agreed with the panel’s assessment
and excluded GiniCorp from the competitive range and continued to evaluate the remaining
two proposals. The contracting officer states that he informed GiniCorp’s Michael Masters of
this decision in a telephone conversation in January 2007:
                                              -2-                     GiniCorp, CAB No. P-0757


       Because GiniCorp was determined to not be in the competitive range, I
       informed GiniCorp through a January 2007 telephone conversation with
       Michael Masters of GiniCorp and through a January 2007 e-mail that GiniCorp
       had been excluded from the competition and that it would not be considered
       for an award. The call was very brief and Mr. Masters did not seem upset. . . .

(July 12, 2007 Toorie Affidavit (Corrected) ¶ 8). DCPS has not located a copy of the email
Toorie states that he sent to GiniCorp. The only evidence presented by GiniCorp on this
factual issue is the following statement of Michael Masters:

       The DC Public Schools had not contacted GiniCorp during the previous five
       (5) months concerning its evaluation of GiniCorp’s proposal nor had it verified
       any of GiniCorp’s references. GiniCorp received no notices from the DC
       Public Schools requesting discussions or presentations to the DC Public
       Schools. GiniCorp received no notification for any best and final offer request.

(June 13, 2007 Masters Affidavit ¶ 8). This affidavit was filed several weeks before the
Toorie affidavit was filed by DCPS. GiniCorp responded on July 18 with legal argument
responding to Toorie’s July 12 corrected affidavit and DCPS’s July 11 supplemental Agency
Report and motion to dismiss on timeliness, but GiniCorp never submitted any evidence
directly and unequivocally rebutting Toorie’s statement that he had a brief conversation with
Masters sometime in January 2007 in which he informed Masters that GiniCorp was excluded
from the competition. Masters’ statement in his affidavit that DCPS “had not contacted
GiniCorp during the previous five (5) months” is ambiguous as to timing and thus is not
unambiguously inconsistent with Toorie having a telephone conversation with Masters
between January 1 and January 12, 2007. GiniCorp had adequate opportunity to persuasively
rebut Toorie’s statement but failed to do so. On the evidence presented, we find that Toorie
communicated to Masters in January 2007 that GiniCorp was excluded from the competition.

        The contracting officer ultimately selected Tandem for award and DCPS entered into a
letter contract with Tandem on March 15, 2007. DCPS definitized that contract on April 23,
2007. The Board received GiniCorp’s protest on April 27, 2007.

         In its protest, GiniCorp’s chief executive officer, Virginia Masters, states that
GiniCorp learned about the contract award to Tandem from an IBM employee assigned to the
same work. Masters states that GiniCorp requested a meeting with Kevin Green, the
subsequent DCPS contracting officer, two weeks before the date of its April 23, 2007 protest
letter, i.e., on April 9, 2007. GiniCorp states that Mr. Green refused to meet with GiniCorp.
GiniCorp then mailed its protest and was received by the Board on April 27, 2007.

        DCPS filed its initial Agency Report on June 11, 2007, more than 20 days late.
Shortly thereafter, DCPS engaged outside counsel to represent it. DCPS filed a combined
supplemental Agency Report and a motion to dismiss the protest on July 11, 2007. DCPS
asserts that GiniCorp’s protest, filed on April 27, 2007, was filed more than 10 days after it
knew or should have known of the basis of its protest, and therefore, the protest should be
                                                -3-                      GiniCorp, CAB No. P-0757


dismissed as untimely. On July 18, 2007, GiniCorp filed a motion to strike DCPS’s July 11
submission and in the alternative addressed the merits of the DCPS filing.

                                         DISCUSSION

        We begin by addressing the threshold issue of whether GiniCorp’s protest was timely
filed. The Procurement Practices Act provides that protests, other than challenges to the
terms of a solicitation, “shall be filed no later than ten (10) business days after the basis of
protest is known or should have been known.” D.C. Code §2-309.08(b)(2). See Sigal
Construction Corp., CAB No. P-0690, et al., Nov. 24, 2004, 52 D.C. Reg. 4243, 4253-54;
Professional Recruiters, Inc., CAB No. P-0700, Dec. 21, 2004, 52 D.C. Reg. 4258, 4259-60.

        In the motion to dismiss, DCPS asserts that GiniCorp filed its protest more than 10
days after the date in January 2007 that the contracting officer, by telephone and email,
informed GiniCorp that its proposal was no longer in the competitive range. GiniCorp moved
to strike DCPS’s motion to dismiss, asserting that DCPS could not file a motion to dismiss
after DCPS had already filed a late Agency Report. DCPS’s supplementation of the deficient
initial Agency Report was entirely consistent with our order on July 11 for such
supplementation. Nothing in our order or in our rules prohibited DCPS from including a
motion to dismiss on timeliness in this submission. GiniCorp did not request additional time
to respond to the submission and we cannot conclude that GiniCorp was prejudiced by the
supplemental submissions of DCPS. Indeed, we find merit in DCPS’s argument that
GiniCorp untimely filed its protest.

         Although the protest record was extended unnecessarily by DCPS’s failure to file its
initial June 11 Agency Report in a timely manner, and further by DCPS’s failure to raise the
timeliness issue in that submission, DCPS cured its inadequate June 11 submission when its
newly retained outside counsel filed the supplemental pleadings on July 11 and July 12, 2007.
The protest record also has been hampered by DCPS’s failure to locate and file a copy of the
email message which Toorie states he sent to Masters in January 2007. Notwithstanding
DCPS’s poor record keeping on this procurement, a situation we expect will not be repeated
in the future, we find that the uncontradicted statement by Toorie that he informed Masters by
telephone in January 2007 that GiniCorp had been excluded from the competition, renders the
April 27 protest of GiniCorp untimely. As we found above, nothing in Masters’ affidavit
directly and unambiguously contradicts Toorie’s recollection of the January telephone
conversation. Because GiniCorp filed its protest on April 27, 2007, more than 10 business
days after learning of its exclusion from the competition in January 2007, GiniCorp’s protest
is untimely.

       We have concerns about the methods used by DCPS to notify unsuccessful offerors
about significant procurement actions. In this matter, the original contracting officer, no
longer employed by DCPS, notified the offeror by telephone and email that the offeror had
been excluded from the competitive range. The contracting officer should have documented
contemporaneously his actions in the contract file, not leaving it to an affidavit after a protest
has been filed. Moreover, contracting officers should notify bidders and offerors in writing
                                             -4-                     GiniCorp, CAB No. P-0757


and without delay when making determinations such as to award or not to consider further a
firm’s bid or offer.

                                     CONCLUSION

       For the reasons discussed above, we dismiss GiniCorp’s protest as untimely filed.
