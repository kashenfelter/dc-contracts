                                              OPINION
                                     (Lexis-Nexis Filing ID 7698144)


        Protester Traffic Lines, Inc., alleged in its protest that the District had improperly rejected
Traffic’s bid as late. The District’s Agency Report and the Intervenor’s brief assert that the
Board must reject Traffic’s bid because the bid was late. The Board agrees that the District
properly rejected Traffic’s bid as late.

                                          BACKGROUND

        The District of Columbia Department of Transportation (“DDOT”), Office of
Administrative Services, Construction Procurement Support Branch, issued WASA issued
Solicitation No. POKA-2005-B-0011-CR for FY 05 Federal Aid Hot Thermoplastic Pavement
Marking. On August 25, 2005, DDOT issued an amendment changing the bid opening date to
August 29, 2005. The bid opening time remained at 2:00 p.m. (AR Ex. 1). The bid form
required bidders to submit their bids to the Department of Transportation, Office of
Administrative Services, Construction Procurement Support Branch, 2000 14th Street, NW, 3rd
Floor, Washington, DC, 20009. (AR Ex. 1). The IFB also required bidders to mark the bid in
the following manner:

       Mark envelope in upper left corner as follows:
       Invitation No.: POKA-2005-B-0011-CR
       To be opened (date):
       At 2:00 P.M.

      According to the protester, DHL Express delivered on August 29, 2005, at 10:21 A.M., a
package to Temisha Lassiter, Customer Services Representative, Traffic Services
Administration, DDOT. The package was addressed to the “Government of the District of
                                               2
                                                                          Traffic Lines, Inc., CAB No. P-0715


Columbia, 2000 14th St., N.W. 3rd floor, Washington, DC 20009, Contracting and Procurement,
202-698-3602. (AR Ex. 2). There were no markings on the package to indicate that the package
included a bid.

        Ms. Lassiter placed the package in the Field Operations Box so that the package could be
sent to Mr. Frank Pacifico. (AR Ex. 5). At approximately 3:05 p.m., Mr. Pacifico came to
retrieve his mail. Mr. Pacifico told Ms. Lassiter that the package should have been delivered to
the bid room. (AR Ex. 5). At that point, Ms. Lassiter took the package to the bid room at
approximately 3:17 P.M. (AR Ex. 3). On September 21, 2005, the Contracting Officer notified
Traffic by letter that the District had rejected Traffic’s bid because the bid was late. On
September 30, 2005, Traffic filed its protest. D.C. Line, Inc., intervened in the protest on
October 19, 2005.
                                             DISCUSSION

         Traffic asserts in its protest that the bid was timely delivered to the required address, and
that it has no control over the internal routing of mail at the building. Traffic also asserts that it
could not determine whether the low bidder, D.C. Line, Inc., truly exists. Because we conclude
that Traffic’s bid was untimely delivered, there is no need to address Traffic’s assertion
regarding the existence of the low bidder.

      The District asserts that the protester’s delivery vendor, DHL Express, delivered the
package to the address noted on the package, and that the package did not include the delivery
markings set forth in the IFB.

        D.C. Code § 2-303.04 governs procurement by competitive sealed bidding. Title 27,
Chapter 15, sets forth the procurement regulations applicable to competitive sealed bidding.
Regulations addressing receipt of bids are set forth at 27 DCMR § 1523.2 and regulations
governing consideration of a late bid for award are set forth at 27 DCMR § 1523.5. In pertinent
part, these regulations provide:
       1523.2 Any bid received at the place designated in the solicitation after the time and date
              set for receipt of bids shall be considered a "late" bid unless it was received prior
              to the contract award and either of the following applies:
               (a) It was sent by registered or certified mail not later than five (5) calendar days
               before the bid receipt date specified; or
               (b) It was sent by mail (or telegram if authorized) and the contracting officer
               determines that the late receipt was due solely to mishandling by the District after
               receipt at the location specified in the IFB.

        As a general rule, bidders are responsible for delivering their bids to the proper place at
the proper time. A late bid delivered by a commercial carrier may not be considered where it is
late due to the failure of the bidder to fulfill its responsibility for ensuring timely delivery to the
designated location. If the bidder did not significantly contribute to the late delivery, and the
sole or paramount cause of the bid’s late receipt in the bid opening room is due to government
mishandling, the bid should be considered timely submitted. See W.S. Jenks & Son, CAB No. P-
                                                      3
                                                                                     Traffic Lines, Inc., CAB No. P-0715


0644, Aug. 14, 2001, 49 D.C. Reg. 3374, and Quest Diagnostics, CAB No. P-0480, July 9, 1997,
44 D.C. Reg. 6849.

        Here, Traffic significantly contributed to the late delivery by failing to properly address
the envelope containing its bid and by failing to deposit the bid at the location indicated in the
solicitation (“Government of the District of Columbia” rather than “Department of
Transportation, Office of Administrative Services, Construction Procurement Support Branch,
2000 14th Street, NW, 3rd Floor, Washington, DC 20009”).1 Traffic also failed to indicate the
Invitation number and bid opening date and time on the upper left corner of the envelope.

        Accordingly, the contracting officer did not violate law or regulations in concluding that
Traffic’s bid was untimely. We deny the protest.


         SO ORDERED.

  We note that the address set forth on the bid form at the bottom of the page in the instructions for marking the bid
envelope (“Address as follows”) does not contain the line “Department of Transportation” that is included in items 1
and 3 in the instructions at the top of the Title Page (MD Ex. 1). However, Traffic did not mark its bid with either
variation of the address.
