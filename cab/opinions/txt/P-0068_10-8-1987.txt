                                                            )        CAB No. p-68
        Under RFP CF 004-87                                 )



                                   SUMMARY OF DECISION
      1. Protest is dismissed due to protester's failure to
include in its protest letter a clear and concise statement of
the legal and factual grounds of the protest in accordance with
the Board's protest procedures.

      2. Protester, whose protest is dismissed for failure to
satisfy clear and concise statement requirement, may refile
protest with the Board if the protester learns or has knowledge
of details regarding the decision not to award it a contract
which establish a valid basis of protest, provided the refiling
meets the clear and concise statement and time limit requirements
set forth in the Board's protest procedures.


                                          DECISION

        with    respect      to     the   subj~ct           request        for   proposal,      CTA
Management      Group       Inc.     ( "'CTA")        states        in     its     letter    dated

September 23,        1987, to the Board that it "has been notified that

[its]   contract was         not     renewed      for       the    coming year,        and     [it]

would like to appeal this decision."                             Neither CTA's letter nor

the    letter   to    the    Department          of    Employment          Services     ("DOES")

enclosed     with     it    explains      why         CTA       believes     the    decision     is

erroneous.

        The Board has previously stated that its protest procedures

(CAB    Proposed     Rule    300.3(c»       require             that a     protest    include     a

clear and concise statement of the legal and factual grounds of

the protest.          See   Protest of           US    Sprint Communications Company
                                               - 2 -

under RFP No. 7055-AA-99-N--7-LH at 2 (Feb. 27, 1987).                                  The Board

also stated in us Sprint that "[t]his rule envisions a statement

which    is    suff icient    to     appr ise         the    Board       and    the   contracting

agency of the specific aspects of the procurement to which the

protester objects, rather than merely a statement of disagreement

with not receiving an award.                          "     rd.

         Here, the Board finds that CTA's September 23,                               1987 letter

falls    considerably        short       of    satisfying          the     clear      and   concise

statement      requirement         and    therefore             leaves    the     Board     without

jurisdiction to give the protest further consideration.                                      Should
CTA learn or have knowledge of details regarding the decision not

to award it a contract which establish a valid basis of protest,

eTA may renew its protest by filing with the Board a clear and

concise       statement      of    the        legal       and     factual      grounds      of   the

protest, provided the filing meets the time limit prescribed in

CAB     Proposed    Rule      300.4.            (A     copy       of   the     Board's      protest

procedures is enclosed with CTA's copy of this decision.)

         For the foregoing reasons, CTA's protest is dismissed.                                  The

District,      therefore,         need   not     submit an agency                report at this
time.
