                                           OPINION
                                         Filing ID 32471737

        Mid Atlantic Tennis Courts & Supplies has challenged two solicitations issued by the
Department of Real Estate Services (“DRES”), Contracting and Procurement Division, on behalf
of the Department of Parks and Recreation (“DPR”) for resurfacing of tennis and basketball
courts. Mid Atlantic did not submit a bid. Each solicitation was for a “brand name or equal”
resurfacing product to be used by the contractor. The solicitation identified a product called
Premier Court as the “brand name” resurfacing product. Mid Atlantic is a resurfacing contractor
and hoped to be a subcontractor for the contractor ultimately selected by the District. Mid
Atlantic challenges the District’s decision to specify a “brand name or equal” resurfacing product
in both IFBs, and to require that the product be installed only by a Premier Court authorized
installer. Because Mid Atlantic is not an aggrieved party, it lacks standing to protest.
Accordingly, we dismiss the protest.

                                       BACKGROUND

        On March 1, 2010, IFB No. DCHA-2010-B-0105 was issued for the resurfacing of tennis
courts at the Fort Stevens Recreation Center, 1327 Van Buren St., N.W., with bid opening on
March 22, 2010. (Corrected Agency Report “AR” Ex. 1). On March 22, IFB No. DCHA-2010-
B-0112 was issued for the resurfacing of select basketball and tennis courts at DPR facilities
throughout the District. (AR Ex. 4). Both solicitations specified the installation of the “Premier
Court” resurfacing system manufactured by Premier Concepts, Inc., or an approved equal. (AR
Ex. 1, at 5; AR Ex. 4, at 5). The specifications also provided that alternative products could be
submitted to DPR for approval prior to submission of bids. (AR Ex. 4). No proposals for
alternative products were timely submitted by any bidder in connection with the 0105 IFB. (AR
at 4). It appears that one alternative product, called Xtreme Court, was approved by DPR for one
tennis court under the 0112 IFB. (AR at 7). On March 22, 2010, eight bids were received in
response to the 0105 IFB, with Mosaic Investment Group (“MIG”) as the apparent low bidder.
Mid Atlantic did not submit a bid. (AR Ex. 22). The contract specialist requested that MIG
                                                -2-             Mid Atlantic Tennis Courts & Supplies
                                                                                     CAB No. P-0849


confirm that it would use the Premier Court product for the Fort Stevens courts. In a March 31,
2010 email, MIG confirmed its use of the Premier Court product and that installation would be
done by American Tennis Courts, Inc. (“ATC”), one of three installers approved by Premier
Concepts. (AR Ex. 9; AR at 4-5). Mid Atlantic is not an approved Premier Court installer. (AR
Ex. 11). MIG asked the contracting agency if it could consider a quote from Mid Atlantic as one
of the installers for the Premier Court product. On April 1, 2010, the contracting officer sent a
letter to MIG rejecting its bid on the mistaken basis that MIG was not installing a Premier Court
system and that Mid Atlantic, a proposed installer, was not on the list of authorized installers of
the Premier Court system, and that failure to use an authorized installer would prevent the
District from receiving the 25-year warranty from Premier Concepts for the re-surfacing. (AR
Exs. 13, 16).

        Thereafter, Mid Atlantic raised questions of possible “unfair practices” and requested a
meeting with DRES representatives. (AR Ex. 17). Mid Atlantic alleged that MIG’s decision to
use ATC as its installer on the Fort Stevens project was prompted by the fact that ATC and
Premier Concepts have common ownership. (AR Ex. 17). On April 7, 2010, after hearing the
concerns of Mr. Farthing of Mid Atlantic, DRES’s Deputy Director of the Contracting and
Procurement Division requested that the 0105 and 0112 procurements be delayed until DRES
completed an investigation. (AR Ex. 11). On April 8, 2010, Amendment 2 extended bid
opening for the 0112 IFB to April 26, 2010. (AR Ex. 6). On April 9, 2010, as a result of a
meeting with Mid Atlantic, the contracting officer sent a letter to Premier Concepts requesting
information on the process used to authorize a company to install the Premier Court system.
(AR Ex. 12). Premier Concepts responded that unless its product was installed by an authorized
installer, it could not issue a 25-year warranty to the District. Premier Concepts discussed the
training, experience, and oversight required by Premier Concepts before an installer can be
considered “authorized” to install its products. (AR Ex. 13). Based on this information, the
Deputy Director considered the investigation completed and directed the contracting officer to
award the contract (to MIG) under the 0105 IFB, and proceed with the receipt of bids for the
0112 IFB. (AR Ex. 11).

       On April 13, 2010, Mid Atlantic filed its protest. For the Fort Stevens project, Mid
Atlantic challenges the contracting officer’s decision not to allow installers who were not
authorized Premier Court installers, and for the District-wide solicitation, the specifications
should be modified to identify other re-surfacing products equivalent to Premier Courts.

                                         DISCUSSION

       We exercise jurisdiction over this protest pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03 (a)(1).

       The Procurement Practices Act (“PPA”) requires that a protester be “any actual or
prospective bidder, offeror, or contractor who is aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or
award of a contract.” D.C. Code § 2-309.08(a).

       With respect to both solicitations, Mid Atlantic is not an aggrieved party as it did not bid
on either solicitation, and seeks only to be an installation subcontractor for a prime contractor
under the solicitations. Although Mid Atlantic, as a potential subcontractor, has some economic
                                                -3-             Mid Atlantic Tennis Courts & Supplies
                                                                                     CAB No. P-0849


interest in offering services to a prime contract awardee, that interest is not the direct economic
interest of an actual or prospective bidder as contemplated by the PPA. Virginia E. Durbin,
CAB No. P-0591, Sept. 13, 1999, 46 D.C. Reg. 8693, 8694; Control Technologies, Inc., B-
251335, Jan. 5, 1993, 94-1 CPD ¶ 16. As Mid Atlantic is not an aggrieved party and lacks
standing, its challenges cannot be adjudicated here.

                                        CONCLUSION

       For the reasons discussed above, we dismiss Mid Atlantic’s protest because it is not an
aggrieved party.
