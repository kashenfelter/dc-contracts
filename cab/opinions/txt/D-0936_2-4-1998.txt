                                           OPINION

       Appellants, W.J. McGee & Associates, P.C., and Leroy J.H. Brown & Associates, P.C.,
joint venturers, seek an equitable adjustment to their architect-engineer contract amounting to
$223,700 for work they claim was beyond the contract scope of work. We conclude that
Appellants have not met their burden of proof on quantum for some claims, and have not shown
other claimed effort was extra work. The remaining claims are foreclosed because Appellants
previously received full compensation under Change Order No. 1 for what they are now claiming
was extra work. Accordingly, we deny the appeal.

                                             FACTS

        This case involves claims by the Appellants for extra compensation regarding Contract No.
4468-72, a contract for architectural and design services for the comprehensive modernization of
28 buildings containing a total of 314 housing units at the Carrollsburg Dwellings located in the
District. Â«Consolidated Hearing File ("CHF") Ex. 1; Tr.498-499).

        Appellants initially stated their claim as one for Uextra work and cost overrun" amounting
to $198,606 (essentially, a total cost claim), compensation for a wrongful deduction of $21,160,
extra roof ventilation work of $1,100, attorneys fees, and prejudgment interest. (See Complaint;
Appellants' Prehearing Statement). During the hearing, Appellants identified in support of their
claim for $198,606 the following alleged changes to the scope of work which required extra
architectural and engineering design work: (1) certain building units which had suffered fire
damage (the uburned" units); (2) the canopies and foyers; (3) the handicapped units; (4) phasing
of cost estimates; (5) playground equipment; and (6) storage facilities and toilets. In their
                                               -2-                     McGee & Brown, CAB No. 0-936


posthearing brief, Appellants seek $202,540 for these six items. 1

        The District argues that the contract scope of work defined by the March 31, 1986 contract
and Change Order No.1, issued August 26, 1987, act as a complete accord and satisfaction for
all elements of Appellants' claims.

        The first relevant pre-contract meeting between representatives of the parties took place
at a meeting held on or about August 5, 1985. At that meeting, Mr. Benjamin F. Carter, Jr.,
Chief of the Maintenance Engineering Department of the District's Department of Housing and
Community Development ("DHCD") advised Mr. W. Jerome McGee and Mr. Leroy Brown that
their joint venture had been selected to perform the architectural and design work for the
Carrollsburg modernization project. (Tr. 19-20). Mr. Carter handed them a two-page document
entitled "Project Justification & Scope of Work." The document's "Project Overview" section
provides in part:

       Carrollsburg Dwelling is a 314-unit complex located in Southeast Washington. It
       requires extensive renovation to address serious problems of deterioration, which
       include the following: bathrooms and kitchen fittings and equipment are
       unserviceable; vinyl floors have deteriorated; canopies are either missing or are in
       a poor state of repair; electrical systems are inadequate; gas-fired boilers are aged
       and nearly unserviceable; kitchen and bathroom mechanical piping and fixtures
       have deteriorated; gutters and downspouts are corroding and should be connected
       to the storm drainage system; several roofs have fire and water damage; smoke
       detectors are in a poor state of repair; existing apartment entrance doors are not
       insulated and hardware is not secure; existing hardwood floors have some surface
       damage and wear; joists and sub floors in 20 townhouse units have dry-rotted;
       screen doors are required, and existing wall and ceiling surfaces show considerable
       wear. An energy audit has shown a need for additional insulation on exterior
       walls. There are no accommodations for handicapped persons on site. Renovated
       spaces require insect and rodent extermination; property maintenance facilities are
       inadequate, the administration area is in need of upgrading; the property is
       experiencing erosion and alleys need resurfacing; underground gas and water lines
       do not have corrosion protection; storm drains are clogged and need cleaning;
       maintenance crews need exterior access to sanitary lines; exterior lighting within
       the property is inadequate; and relocation is required for phased construction.

(CHF Ex. 7, at 1). The "Scope of Work" section reads in full:




1 In their posthearing brief, Appellants identify quantum amounts for each of the six claimed
changes, the sum of which is $202,540, after correcting for an arithmetic error. See note 6 infra.
                                               -3-                      McGee & Brown, CAB No. D-936


       Correct erosion; construct dumpster pads; repair or replace chain link fencing and
       clothes poles; install cathodic protection on gas and water piping; install clean-outs
       in sanitary sewer lines to units; install 46 pole-mounted lights, including
       underground wiring; provide new kitchen and bathroom fittings; install new vinyl
       floor tile and underlayment; construct exterior foyers for townhouses; upgrade
       electrical systems; install gas-fired warm-air system in townhouses; replace piping
       and convectors in apartment units; install gas-fired, hot-water heaters in 86 units;
       replace all mechanical piping and fixtures in kitchens and bathrooms; replace
       gutters and leaders and tie into storm system; replace roofing as required; repair
       or replace smoke detectors; install insulated doors and hardware; refinish hardwood
       floors; install screen doors; repair, spackle, and paint walls and ceilings; insulate
       exterior walls; provide insect and rodent extermination; purchase equipment for
       maintenance operation; and provide relocation services.

        In an August 5, 1985 memorandum, Mr. Carter notified the property managers at
Carrollsburg that the Appellants had been selected as the design team for the modernization
project, that the Appellants expected to begin their work with a physical needs survey of the
property on August 6, 1985, and that the building managers should cooperate in giving the
Appellants access to the property. (CHF Ex. 6). The parties met again on August 14, 1985,
discussing the scope of work and agreeing on a deadline for Appellants to submit a price proposal.
(CHF Ex. 24). At some point in August, Appellants began a physical needs survey of the
Carrollsburg project which involved surveying each of the 314 units. (Tr. 21, 274, 367).

        By letter dated August 22, 1985, Appellants submitted a general outline of the scope of
work and a price proposal to perform the Title I architectural and engineering design work (i. e. ,
the services to prepare the plans and specifications for the follow-on construction contract) and
the Title IT services (i.e., services provided during the actual construction phase of the project)
which comprised shop drawings review and site inspection services. (CHF Ex. 24). The scope
of work included general repairs to the interior of the housing units, such as installation of new
kitchen equipment, new baths and showers, new floor tiles, new insulation, upgraded electric
service, and repair or replacement of the existing canopies on all units. General repairs to the
exterior included replacing some portions of the sewer, regrading the site, and repair or
replacement of concrete walks. The cover letter identified the total price as $594,016 but the
pricing data shows a total price of $653,813, with Title I services amounting to $410,453, and
Title IT services amounting to $243,360. The pricing detail contains some arithmetic errors.

        Appellants continued their survey work in September and perhaps into October 1985. (Tr.
25). In response to a September 30, 1985 meeting with Mr. Carter, the Appellants submitted by
letter of October 2, 1985, another price proposal and in this proposal the pricing detail adds up
to the $594,016 amount stated in the August 22 cover letter. (CHF Ex. 26). In the October 2
cover letter, Appellants note DHCD's urgency that work commence. Appellants state that they
are ready to commence work on the project immediately "since it appears all contractual matters
are imminent. Appellants request that Mr. Carter advise them if he desires that they begin work
             II


at once. (CHF Ex. 26). Apparently, Appellants received oral direction from DHCD because
                                              - 4-                    McGee & Brown, CAB No. D-936


Appellants began preliminary design work for the schematics in October 1985, using the two-page
scope of work previously provided by Mr. Carter inÂ· August. (Tr. 25, 31-32). The record
references, but does not contain, a third price proposal submitted by Appellants on November 19,
1985, in the amount of $466,613. (See CHF Ex. 8).

         By December 1985, every unit had been surveyed and Appellants had submitted to DHCD
some schematics showing a "kind of a composite layout of all of the rooms and buildings on the
site." (Tr. 21,25). Also in December, Mr. Harold Johnson was appointed the DHCD contract
representative for the project. He retained that position until September 1987. (Tr. 289, 318,
358-359). Mr. Johnson was given the task of putting together a notice of award with a specified
award amount. He reviewed Appellants' prior proposals and calculated an award amount of
$469,793 based on the estimates contained in the Appellants' initial price proposal (totaling
$653,813), as annotated by Mr. Johnson to correct certain arithmetic errors in Appellants'
numbers and to deduct $187,200 for some of Appellants' proposed Title IT services (to be
performed during actual construction) which the District decided to do itself. (CHF Ex. 25, Tr.
107-112, 226, 307-309). Sometime in mid-December, Mr. Johnson reviewed the corrected and
revised price proposal amount with Messrs. McGee and Brown. There is no indication in the
record that Appellants' principals voiced any objection to Mr. Johnson regarding the proposed
award amount but rather they worked together with him on it. (Tr. 108-112). A DHCD
contracting officer issued a "Notice of Award/Notice to Proceed" to Appellants on December 20,
1985, with a price correction agreed to by the parties on December 23, authorizing Appellants to
begin design work starting December 30, 1985. (CHF Ex. 8). The notice states that Appellants'
earlier proposal is accepted with a revised price of $469,793. Appellants acknowledged receipt
of the notice and made no objection to the revised award amount. The notice advises Appellants
that a "formal contract is being prepared and will be forwarded to you in the near future."
Although the notice does not expressly define the scope of work, we find from the record that the
scope was defined in the "Scope of Work" section of the 2-page "Project Justification & Scope of
Work" document given to Appellants on August 5, 1985, as supplemented by the general scope
of work furnished by Appellants in their August 22, 1985 proposal. (See, e.g., CHF Exs. 8, 9;
Tr. 366-367).

        From the beginning, both parties understood that Appellants would be revising, refming,
and giving detail to the August 1985 scope of work, based on the information in the August 1985
project overview, Appellants' detailed field survey of every unit, and Appellants' architectural
experience. Throughout the survey period, Appellants' personnel were in ongoing discussions
with Mr. Carter and Mr. Johnson concerning what Appellants recommended be incorporated into
the "formal" or definitized contract scope of work. (E.g., Tr. 365-372, 385-395). For example,
although the original August 1985 project overview mentioned the need for handicapped
accommodations, the accompanying work scope did not mention design for handicapped
accommodations. During the survey period, Appellants' representatives notified Mr. Johnson of
the need for handicapped accommodations and in December 1985 Mr. Johnson instructed them
to design 15 of the units to accommodate handicapped persons. (Tr. 365-370, 390, 419-422).
This took place well before the definitized contract was executed by the parties.
                                               -5-                      McGee cit Brown, CAB No. D-936


        In January 1986, the parties agreed to other revisions of the project scope of work to
include underground utility work, a storm drainage system, and inspection services during
construction. Because of the extent of work involved, the parties agreed to increase the award
price by $75,094, resulting in a new total of $544,087. (CHF Ex. 9; Tr. 96-97, 227-229, 281-
282). The revision is reflected in a January 13, 1986 internal DHCD memorandum from Mr.
Johnson to Mr. Carter. (CHF Ex. 9). The version of the memorandum in the record contains
additional entries showing a deduction of $21,160 from the contract price for design services
relating to steam condensate return piping work which Mr. Johnson says was included in the
original scope of work (CHF Exs. 1, 7; Tr. 286-289, 312) but needed to be removed because the
design had previously been performed by an engineering firm, Diversified Engineering, Inc.,
under a separate contract with the District. (See CHF Exs. 9, 10). The Appellants subcontracted
various engineering requirements of their project work to Diversified. (See CHF Ex. A).
Although the parties dispute when Mr. Johnson inserted the $21,160 deduction on the
memorandum - January 13, 1986 according to Mr. Johnson, February 14, 1986 according to Mr.
McGee - the issue is irrelevant. Appellants agree that they received notice of the proposed
deduction, which would lower the contract price to $523,727, at least by February 13, 1986, a
full month before the parties executed the definitized contract on March 21, 1986. (CHF Ex. 10;
Tr. 298; if. Tr. 95-97). Mr. McGee testified that he orally protested the proposed deduction of
$21,160 from the contract price.         (Tr. 275-279). Although Mr. McGee testified that he
communicated his protest in writing (Tr. 100), there is no such written communication in the
record. When asked whether he had some understanding that the $21,160 was going to be re-
inserted into the contract price, he stated "No, but we knew we were going to protest it." (Id.).
He stated that he did not protest prior to the definitized contract because he did not want to lose
the contract over a dispute concerning this amount. (Tr. 100-101). He testified that the
Appellants' scope of work did not include the Diversified design work but rather the Appellants'
scope of work only covered having Diversified's design drawings incorporated into Appellants'
final construction drawings. Mr. Johnson seems to have used the $21,160 price in Diversified's
separate contract with the District as the basis for his deduction from the Appellants' price.

        On February 6, 1986, still before the definitized contract had been executed by the parties,
Appellants submitted a complete schematic package with preliminary drawings showing the
suggested layout for each room within the 314 units at Carrollsburg. The submission also
included outline specifications and a complete report providing a written description of all
conditions that Appellants had discovered on the site during the extensive survey that began in
August 1985. (Tr. 25-27, 365-372; CHF Ex. 13, at 2). Appellants' February 1986 package set
forth a proposed scope of work and Appellants were aware from their discussions with DHCD
representatives that their proposed scope of work would form the basis for the scope of work
under the definitized contract. (Tr. 367, 368-372). Unfortunately, neither party introduced the
February 1986 package into the record.

      For the period August 1985 through early March 1986, Appellants state that there was no
"formal contract" in place and there was no written arrangement by which they would receive
                                               -6-                     McGee & Brown, CAB No. D-936

payment for services. 2 Mr. McGee testified that this situation was not unusual for architects who
performed services for the District government. (Tr. 26, 34).

       The Dejinitized Contract

         The record sheds little light on the circumstances surrounding the actual execution of the
definitized contract, Contract No. 4468-72, dated March 21, 1986. (CHF Ex. 1). The contract
required the Appellants to proceed with the design and preparation of construction contract plans
and specifications for Carrollsburg and to complete the work within 180 days from the December
1985 Notice of AwardlNotice to Proceed. It provides for a tota1lump sum fee not to exceed
$523,727, consisting of $459,647 for all Title I architectural and design services and construction
document preparation work, and $64,080 for the Title II construction services option, such as site
visits, inspection of construction, and review of shop drawings and samples. (CHF Ex. 1, at 5).
Appendix A of the contract, entitled "Scope of Work", summarizes the Title I requirements as
follows:

       In depth restoration of all units including, Mechanical, Electrical, all Structural
       Elements, Architectural Elements and Common Spaces.

(Appendix A, Part A). Under the subheading "Services to be Performed" appears the following:

       All necessary services for complete restoration of the Carrollsburg Apartments and
       Garden Units, including the items listed in the Scope of the AlE services (attached)
       and to conform with the following attachments: 1.) Standards for Modernization
       of Public Housing and 2.) Schedule for AlE Services.

(Id., Part B). Under the subheading "Scope of Work" appears the following:

       Complete renovation of 314 units as follows[:] General repairs to Interior and
       Exterior of units; complete underground Utility Services, Landscaping throughout
       site, Upgrading all Electrical Systems and Upgrade hallways and public spaces; See
       attached AlE Scope of Work and Standards for Modernization of Public Housing.

(Id., Part D). Under a heading "Design Requirements are:" appears the following pertinent
information:




2 In its posthearing brief, Appellants state that they are not making any claim for compensation
for the period from August 1985 through March 21, 1986 (the date of contract execution). The
fact is the survey and schematic work was always a part of the scope of work and compensation
for that work was included in their price proposals that formed the basis of the December 1985
Notice of Award amount of $469,793. (See CHF Ex. 8, 24, 25, 26).
                                               -7-                     McGee & Brown, CAB No. D-936


        Architectural Requirements;

        Provide all services contained in the AlE proposal and DRCD Design requirements.

        Electrical Requirements;

        Complete upgrading of the Electrical Systems, Fire Alarm Systems; replace smoke
        detectors, provide extra circuit for A/C unit and provide (45) pole mounted lights
        including underground wiring. See Attached AlE Scope of Work.

        Mechanical Requirements:

        Provide new kitchen and bathroom fittings; replace piping and convertors in units; new
        disposal units, washerldryer combination in each unit; complete condensate replacement
        design, specifications and estimates; and work stops 5' outside of building. Provide plans
        and shop drawings services. Including in AlE Work Scope.

Neither party made the "AlE Scope of Work" referenced above a part of the appeal record. Based
on the "Design Requirements" text and the hearing testimony, we find that the "AlE Scope of
Work" was prepared by Appellants, and more likely than not, was the work scope prepared by
Appellants and submitted as part of its February 1986 package. The" AlE Scope of Work" is not
attached to any version of the contract included in the Appeal File, Appeal File Supplements, or
the Consolidated Rearing File. Nevertheless, based on the other documentation of record and the
transcript of the hearing, we are satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to determine the
contractual scope of work governing Appellants' performance so far as the issues of this appeal
are concerned.

        Changes to the Contract Scope of Work

          When residents of Carrollsburg became aware of DRCD's comprehensive modernization
 project, they requested a meeting involving the architects and DReD. The meeting occurred
 shortly after contract execution, on April 3, 1986. The residents expressed their displeasure with
.the manner in which the project had been handled and various residents' groups complained about
 the proposed modifications. The residents and property management requested certain changes
 be made to the planned design, including replacing the existing steam boilers and steam supply
 lines with a hot water system and converting the currently vacant basement space into fmished
 space offering a resident manager's office, a community clothing facility, and a resident laundry
 facility. (CHF Ex. 13, Ex. E).

        On June 26, 1986, Appellants submitted a 3-page document entitled "General Repair and
Modernization of Carrollsburg" setting forth a modified scope of design work for the Carrollsburg
project. (CHF Ex. D; Tr. 591-592, 597, 603, 698-7(0). Most of the items listed in the modified
scope remained unchanged from the definitized contract scope of work. For example, the
individual design items listed under the categories "Kitchens", "Bathrooms", "Living and Dining
                                               -8-                      McGee & Brown, CAB No. D-936


Rooms", "Bedrooms", "Insulation", and "Electrical" were unchanged from the contract scope of
work. The design items listed under the category called "General" were also unchanged, including
that of providing dwelling units for the handicapped. Most of the design items listed under the
category "Exterior & Site" were also unchanged, such as replacing defective concrete walks,
installing new fixtures on light poles, providing new canopies for the front entrance of each of the
228 apartment units, and providing new foyers for each of the 86 townhouse units. 3 (See CHF
Ex. 7; Ex. 24, at 3; Tr. 389-394). Mr. Johnson stated that the changes reflected in Appellants'
June 26 modified design scope resulted from comments received at the April 3, 1986 meeting and
from intense political interest from local and federal officials. (Tr. 592-594, 596-600). The
principal changes are found under the category entitled "Heating", where Appellants' design scope
is to include replacing the steam heating system with a hot water system and replacing all radiators
with fan-coil units having individual controls. Under "Exterior & Site", the modified design scope
adds: "Provide in basement space acceptable to DHCD and tenants, Laundry room." The parties
continued to discuss design scope changes after Appellants' Â·June 26, 1986 proposed revision to
the scope of work.

         By letter dated December 12, 1986, Appellants advised Mr. Johnson that they were acutely
concerned about changes to the contract scope of work without corresponding increases to the
contract price. (CHF Ex. 20). In the letter, Appellants identify "the various scope changes
throughout the project," propose a price adjustment for each, and request a contract action
reflecting the increase. Four scope changes are presented: (1) boiler redesign and the replacement
of the radiators with fan coil units, priced at $60,354; (2) provision of temporary heat throughout
the project, priced at $43,111; (3) changing the entire boiler system from the existing six boilers
to "pulse" boilers, with prices of $59,544 or $115,554 for two alternative implementations; and
(4) provision of a new administrative office, including maintenance shop, relocation of the
community clothing facility, and provision of a laundry room, priced at $4,000.

         The contract provided for DHCD review of schematics, design, and construction
documents being prepared by Appellants, at various stages of development. (Contract, Appendix
B). At some point in early 1987, Appellants submitted to DHCD their 90-95 percent design
documents. We know that the submission was prior to March 26, 1987, the date that Proceed
Order No. 1 issued, because in later correspondence, Appellants state that at the time of their 90-
95 percent submission, Appellants had not yet received the scope of work for the basement
facilities defined in Proceed Order No.1 (which was issued on March 26, 1987). (See CHF Ex.
23). A March 10, 1987 letter from Appellants to Mr. Johnson indicates that the 90-95 percent
submission occurred before March 10. (CHF Ex. 11).

        On March 10, 1987, Messrs. McGee and Brown met with Mr. Johnson to negotiate an
upward price adjustment to the contract for extra work required by various changes in the scope
of work. (See CHF Ex. 11). Appellants had prepared in advance of the meeting a "handwritten
delineation . . . of the various tasks performed over and above the original AlE agreement" which


3 The number of apartments and townhouses at Carrollsburg is set forth in the construction
contract's specifications. (Appeal File, Vol. 2, Tab 7, Specifications, Special Conditions, 1.6-1).

formed the basis for the requested price adjustment. (Id.). The handwritten document was not
made a part of the appeal record. The Appellants confirmed their meeting with a letter dated
March 10. The letter states that the parties reached an agreement "whereby, due to various
changes in [Appellants'] AlE scope of work, [Appellants'] AlE fee was increased (by
$116,439.00) from $523,727.00, per our original agreement dated February 14, 1986, to
$640,166.00 as of March 10, 1987." In the letter, Appellants state that the handwritten
delineation "reflecting both the format and changes [Mr. Johnson] requested to be made, will be
the subject of a separate correspondence." The letter ends by requesting DHCD's "final review
comments on all disciplines." (Id.).

        On March 26, 1987, the contracting officer issued Proceed Order No.1, authorizing the
Appellants to proceed with the changes in the design scope described in an attached "Description
of Change" dated March 25, 1987. (CHF Ex. 4). The "Description of Change" instructed
Appellants to provide a boiler study report and certain emergency design services related to the
boilers, condensate lines, condensate pumps, and sump pumps. It also directed Appellants to
"prepare and perform design documents, construction plans, specification, estimates, coordinate
surveys and field inspections associated with the additional scope of work." This included
performing additional architectural and design services relating to support replacing radiators with
fan coil units and constructing a management office, maintenance shop, new laundry room, and
clothing center. (CHF Ex. 4; Tr. 349).

       Appellants received DHCD's comments on their 90-95 percent construction documents on
April 28, 1987. (See CHF Ex. 23, at 2).

        In the March to early May 1987 time frame, Mr. Johnson directed several additional
changes to the scope of work. After most of the architectural work had been completed for the
15 handicapped units and incorporated in the 90-95 percent submission, Mr. Johnson directed
Appellants to redesign 6 of the 15 handicapped units and make them into standard units. (Tr. 396,
398, 572, 616). Appellants also received direction from Mr. Johnson to replace the townhouse
foyers design with canopies. (Tr. 459, 470; see CHF Ex. E, at 2; Tr. 393-394). In April or May
1987, Appellants became aware the certain housing units had been damaged by fire. (Tr. 432).
In a letter dated May 13, 1987 to the Appellants, Mr. Johnson advised them of 5 units that had
to be included in the construction estimate and directed them to make "a walk through inspection
in order to ascertain the scope of work." (CHF Ex. C). In the Mayor June 1987 time frame,
Appellants' two project managers spent one day surveying the burned units. (Cf, Tr. 576-577
with Tr. 402-403). Design work was done shortly thereafter. (Tr. 577-579).

        The contract required Appellants to submit a detailed cost estimate for all construction
work and that estimate would become the government estimate used for the evaluation of bids
received for the construction contract. (Contract, Appendix A, at 4). Appellants were responsible
for preparing an economical design within a specified mandatory construction cost limitation. (Id.
at 8). During the design development phase, Appellants were required to submit a preliminary
estimate showing "separately (a) the cost of each new building or addition, (b) the work in existing
buildings, and (c) costs of all work outside the buildings; the estimate shall be broken down to
                                               - 10-                    McGee & Brown, CAB No. D-936


show the cost analyses or allowances (noted as such) based on these units." (Appendix B, at 24).
The contract required that the estimate for the construction documents phase be based "on an
accurate detailed quantity survey of both labor and material. Any standard estimating procedure
will be acceptable provided that the conclusions are presented in the order and detail shown on the
Recapitulation Sheet attached. Lump sums or allowances for major items of the estimate shall not
be used." (Id. at 34). Although the Recapitulation Sheet is not in the record, the estimating
requirements suggest that the cost estimates are derived from unit building estimates, consistent
with the requirements for the design development phase's preliminary cost estimates. By May
1987, Mr. Johnson had received from Appellants an initial 100 percent construction documents
phase cost estimate. (See Tr. 664-666, 701-703, 865-866; CHF Ex. C; CHF Ex. 22, at 2).

       On May 11, 1987, Appellants submitted an initial price proposal amounting to $136,233.
(See CHF Ex. B, at 4). Although the proposal was not made a part of the record, Mr. Johnson
testified that the proposal amount covered the changes directed by Proceed Order No. 1 and
project delays attributable to DHCD. (Tr. 232-233). The parties met several times to negotiate
an equitable adjustment to the contract price and completion date. One such negotiation session
took place on May 22, 1987. (See CHF Ex. E).

         Appellants submitted a revised pricing proposal by letter dated May 28, 1987, in the
amount of $116,964. (Id.; Tr. 620-625). The proposal makes clear that it covers both
architectural and engineering work for: (1) converting from steam to hot water heating system;
(2) replacing radiators with fan coil units; (3) converting vacant basement space into a resident
manager's office, with ancillary facilities such as administrative space and an engineer-custodial
facility, a community clothing facility, and a resident laundry facility; (4) emergency boiler work;
and (5) miscellaneous architectural changes. The text for item (5) specifically mentions the effort
of removing (from the 90% drawings) the townhouse entrance foyers "which entailed considerable
architectural redesign and drafting," i.e., replacing them with canopies. (CHF Ex. E; Tr. 393-
394, 458-460, 466-470).

        For their final negotiation session held on June 1, 1987, Mr. Johnson advised Appellants
to bring to the table any other kind of delays or administrative costs due the architect team. (Tr.
258). The parties agreed on a change order amount of $120,194, which included additional
amounts for reproductions of drawings and other miscellaneous fees. (CHF Exs. 3 and E; Tr.
343, 620-625). Appellants submitted another proposal dated June 2, 1987, confirming the
agreement reached by the parties. (CHF Ex. B, at 3; Tr. 248). That proposal was not made a
part of the record.

        During the period May through approximately July, 1987, Appellants were revising their
90-95 percent documents for all disciplines and incorporating the comments received from DHCD
on Apri128. For the new scope added by Proceed Order No.1 and the miscellaneous changes
directed by Mr. Johnson - redesigning 6 handicapped units back into standard units, replacing
the townhouse foyers with canopies, and supplementing the drawings for the 5-7 burned units -
Appellants were incorporating these design elements into the overall construction document
package for Appellants' 100 percent submission. We find that Appellants submitted the 100

percent construction document package by early August based on an August 19, 1987 letter in
which Mr. Johnson mentions that the 100 percent documents are being reviewed by DHCD staff
for comments. (CHF Ex. F; Tr. 271-272).

        In an August 11, 1987 meeting, the parties agreed that the construction documents phase
cost estimate should be divided into six construction phases. (CHF Ex. F). Phasing involved
dividing the 28 buildings into six groups (phases) and preparing a separate cost estimate for each
group.

        On August 26, 1987, DHCD's contracting officer executed Change Order No.1 on behalf
of the District, granting Appellants an increase in the contract price of $120,194 and a time
extension of 432 calendar days based on the changes authorized by Proceed Order No. 1 and all
scope changes incorporated by Appellants' price proposals of May 11, 1987, May 28, 1987, and
June 2, 1987. Change Order No.1 states: "The net increase is the agreed to fixed price to
accomplish the above work and is full and final compensation for the changes included herein."
(CHF Exs. B, E, and 4; Tr. 620-625). In the "Justification for Time Extension" for Change
Order No.1, prepared by Mr. Johnson and dated June 1, 1987, the calculation of the 432-day
extension is explained. First, it identifies 273 calendar days for District-caused delays for the
period of June 27, 1986 to March 26, 1987, involving administrative delays, delays associated
with revisions to the building code, and design and construction document submittal review
delays. (CHF Ex. B, at 3; Tr. 254-262). Second, it identifies a total of 159 days for survey,
study, preliminary design development and DHCD review, and for construction document
preparation and DHCD review for the additional services required under Proceed Order No.1,
covering the period of March 26, 1987 to August 31, 1987. (CHF Ex. B, at 3; Tr. 262-263).
The time extension revised the contract completion date from June 27, 1986, to August 31, 1987.
(Tr. 271).

       Appellants state that they received Change Order No.1 on September 14, 1987. (See CHF
Ex. 3; Posthearing Mem. at 27). Appellants executed Change Order No.1, without reservation,
making it a bilateral contract modification. (CHF Exs. 3 and B). By letter of September 29,
1987, Appellants acknowledged "receipt of the official change order with respect to the overall
changes which have taken place during the course of our Notice to Proceed with the Carrollsburg
Comprehensive Modernization project." (CHF Ex. 22).4 Recognizing the grant of a 432-day time
extension, Appellants' only stated concern raised in the letter is that DHCD "issue a written
statement documenting the cause of delay in conjunction with the change documents [Change
Order No. 1]."



4 Early in his testimony, Mr. McGee stated that Change Order No.1 was "kind of a culmination
of all of the different problems we had had with the mechanical up to that particular point," "either
heating, electrical, and this kind of thing," but did not include any architectural work. (See Tr.
40-47). Based on our review of the documentation included by the parties in the record, including
the correspondence, Proceed Order No.1, the May 28, 1987 proposal, and the Change Order No.
1 documentation, we do not agree with Mr. McGee's assessment.
                                              - 12-                    McGee & Brown, CAB No. 0-936


       Under cover letter dated September 17~ 1987, Appellants submitted their revised cost
estimate for the project, taking into account the scope of work, as changed, and according to the
grouping of the 28 buildings into six phases. (CHF Ex. 21; Tr. 180-181).5 The division of the
buildings into six groups is depicted in the contract drawings. (See Drawing No. SR-1).

         In an OCtober 23, 1987 letter, Appellants note that DHCD wants all documents finalized
and ready to be incorporated into the construction contract bid package by November 6, 1987.
To meet that date, Appellants request that DHCD advise them of the type of play equipment and
their site location. Appellants indicate that there is a meeting with DHCD planned for Monday,
October 26, and that they intend to submit their corrected (revised) cost estimate at the meeting.
In the letter, Appellants request that DHCD provide to them at the meeting all final review
comments regarding Appellants' 100 percent drawings and specifications and the construction
phasing plan. Appellants assure DHCD that if they receive the information and review comments
on OCtober 26, it will take only a few days to finalize the construction documents. (CHF Ex. 23).
Based on a review of record as presented by the parties, we find that Appellants' work was
substantially complete by the end of October 1987. Although Appellants' witnesses testified to
significant architectural effort being performed in November and December 1987, we do not find
that testimony credible in the absence of corroborating documentation. Indeed, in one of
Appellants' claim letters, it identifies the performance period as March 21, 1986 through October
23, 1987, and it gives October 23, 1987 as the date of their 100 percent submission. (CHF Ex.
16, at 3). To the extent that Appellants' OCtober 23 letter suggests some minor architectural work
or corrections would be performed after October 23, 1987, we find the work to be de minimis.

                                         DISCUSSION

       The Board exercises jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to D.C. Code Â§ 1-1189.3.

       Handicapped Units

         Appellants claim they performed extra work in designing the 15 handicapped units, and
later redesigning 6 of the 15 units into standard units. Appellants seek compensation of $22,275.
From the facts described above, it is clear that the initial design of the 15 handicapped units was
covered in the contract scope of work. One of Appellants' witnesses conceded the point. (Tr.
572-573). It is also clear that the parties understood that the redesign of the 6 units was covered
Change Order No. 1.

       Canopies and Foyers

       Initially, both the apartments and townhouses at Carrollsburg had canopies at their
entrances. The contract scope of work called for the repair or replacement of canopies for the
apartments and a new design of exterior foyers, rather than canopies, for the townhouses. After


5 Although the September 17 letter states that McGee's firm did the cost estimate work, Mr.
McGee testified that Mr. Brown's firm did the cost estimating work. (Tr. 184).
                                              - 13 -                   McGee & Brown, CAB No. 0-936


Appellants prepared 90-95 percent design drawings for the townhouse foyers, Mr. Johnson
advised Appellants that DHCD was changing the design by deleting the foyers and replacing them
with canopies.. Appellants claim they performed extra work in redesigning the 82 townhouses to
replace the foyers with canopies. Appellants seek compensation of $60,500. As previously
discussed, the sequence of events leading up to execution of Change Order No. 1 demonstrates
that the redesign and drafting effort was fully covered under Change Order No.1.

       Burned Units

        Appellants claim they performed extra work in supplemental survey and design work for
7 units that were damaged by fire. Appellants seek compensation of $8,490. 6 This scope change,
like that for the handicapped units and the townhouse foyers, was covered by Change Order No.
1.

       Phasing the Construction Cost Estimate

        Appellants seek an adjustment of $98,825 for preparing the construction cost estimate in
six phases. They say they spent 1,050 hours in the period August to October 1987 and another
2,016 hours in the period October to December 1987. Beyond the fact that the record is devoid
of any contemporaneous written notice of such a significant effort, and the claim letters make no
mention of this alleged change, we are not persuaded that the effort in grouping the cost estimates
for the separate buildings into six groups constitutes a material change to the contract scope of
work. The contract required Appellants to prepare a detailed cost estimate by building. "Phasing"
required Appellants to provide a proposed grouping of the 28 buildings into six groups with a cost
estimate for each of the six groups. Appellants have not shown how this effort materially
expanded their cost estimating effort and required over 3,000 additional hours of architect time.

       Playground Equipment

        Appellants seek $11,410 for 374 hours of extra architectural work associated with deleting
work on site drawings and inserting playground equipment. The written record does show that
Appellants did not have DHCD's desired playground equipment as of October 23, 1987.
However, playground equipment was part of the scope of work. Thus, Appellants are only
entitled to compensation to the extent that the delay in providing the specifications for the
playground equipment caused extra work. We conclude that Appellants have not met their burden
of proving quantum. Appellants rely exclusively on hearing testimony from its witnesses but that
testimony does not distinguish between effort required by the contract and truly extra work.

       Storage Facilities, Toilets, Roof Ventilation

       Appellants seek $1,040 for extra work in the basement build-out for the design of storage


6In their posthearing brief, Appellants miscalculate the amount as $4,490. Calculated correctly,
Appellants seek $8,490.

space and to refurbish all toilets and $1,100 for alleged extra roof ventilation work. Appellants
did not support these claim elements with any contemporaneous documentation. For the same
reasons given with regard to the extra work claims relating to the handicapped units, burned units,
and the toWnhouse foyers, we conclude that to the extent any of this effort was extra work, it was
covered by Change Order No.1.

       The Deduction for Condensate Line Work

        Appellants challenge the deduction made by Mr. Johnson in deducting $21,160 for
condensate line work. We conclude that Appellants have legal ground to challenge that deduction.
Mr. Johnson notified Appellants by no later than February 14, 1986, of DHCD's intent to deduct
the amount from the contract price to be incorporated in the definitized contract. Appellants
concede that they executed the March 21, 1986 definitized contract fully aware of the deduction
reflected in the contract price. Having failed to expressly reserve their right in the contract to
later challenge the deduction, they are barred from challenging it now. A.S. McGaughn Co.,

                                        CONCLUSION

        Having carefully considered each of Appellants' arguments in support of their claims for
equitable adjustment, we conclude that Appellants claims fail because either they have not met
their burden of proving quantum or they have received full compensation under Contract Change
Order No.1. Accordingly, Appellants' appeal is denied.
