                                            OPINION

         Central ArmaturelF ort Myers Joint Venture ("Joint Venture" or "Protester") protests the
potential award ofIFB 95-0056-AA-2-0-KA by the District of Columbia, Department of Public Works
("DPW") to the apparent low bidder W. M. Schlosser Co. Inc. ( "Schlosser") for electrical and
mechanical rehabilitation of the 9th and 12th Streets Expressways Project. The Joint Venture alleges
that either DPW relaxed the "Special. Standards of Responsibility" ("Special Standards"), or
alternatively that Schlosser misrepresented its compliance with the Special Standards. The Special
Standards required, among other things, that the prospective contractors have a subcontract with or
be a master electrician licensed in the District of Columbia. Protester claims that Schlosser did not
meet the special standard of responsibility. The record demonstrates that Schlosser has a subcontract
with an electrical contractor possessing a District of Columbia license. We, therefore, deny the
protest.

                                        BACKGROUND

       DPW originally scheduled the bid opening ofIFB 95-0056-AA-2-0-KA for October 1, 1996,
but extended the opening to October 8, 1996 in order to add, among other items, the following
"Special Standard of Responsibility" (Addendum 4):

       The bidder must demonstrate that the company including the Master Electrician
       performed electrical construction work on a minimum of three (3) comparable
       transportation projects in the last five years and have a D.C. Electrical License ...

       The bidder shall submit as part of the responsibility review the following:
                                                2               Central AnnaturelFort Myer, CAB No. P 478

        a.      For each project, list name of project; description and scope of work
                performed by Subcontractor; total project cost; project cost for Subcontract's
                portion of the work; date of contract completion; was project completed in the
                agreed time; Owner contact, including address and telephone number;
                Construction Manager or General Contractor contact, including address and
                telephone number; and

        b.     For project personnel to be assigned to this project, submit resumes of key
               project personnel, including Master Electrician and commitment of their
               performance. Each resume shall include detailed qualifications of the
               personnel, i.e. education, years of experience, types of projects worked on, and'
               locations of projects.

                The Master Electrician shall be assigned at the jobsite while the
                electrical work is being performed for the duration of the contract.·

        (Agency Report ("AR"), Exhibit 1).

    . DPW received four bids on October 8, 1996. CAR, Exhibit 2, bid tab). Schlosser was the
apparent low bidder with a bid price of $8,288,000, and Joint Venture was the apparent second low
bidder with a bid price of $8,758,912. (Jd)

         By letter dated October 15, 1996, DPW requested that bidders submit responsibility
information required by Addendum No.4,. as well as a "pay item schedule indicating each pay item as
 prime contractors portion of work or subcontractor's portion of work." On October 15, 1996,
 Schlosser submitted its response to the Special Standards of Responsibility. (AR, Attachment 1).
 Schlosser informed' DPW that it planned to award the electrical work to Singleton Electric
.("Singleton"). Schlosser attached a firm resume for Singleton, detailing recent comparable electrical
 work on three projects which it had performed in the last 5 years. The materiais submitted for
 Singleton also included a resume of the Master Electrician it anticipated using on the. project. The
 resume described his education, listed the jurisdictions where he was licensed with the dates of
 licensure and his work experience with Singleton from 1986 to 1996. Schlosser also submitted its firm
 resume, which summarized its 35 years of experience as a general contractor. The submission listed
 five comparable projects on which Schlosser had worked during the last 5 years, three of which were
 completed for DPW. Schlosser and Singleton both cited work on the 1-395 Center Leg of the Inner
 Loop Rehabilitation of the Mall Tunnel, completed for DPW. Schlosser's submission included
 resumes of its key personnel. By letter dated, November 8, 1996, Schlosser submitted to DPW a copy
 of Singleton'S District of Columbia electrical license # 744000017. (AR, Attachment 2).

        Fort Myers Construction Corporation and Central Armature Works, Inc. formed a joint
venture for the purpose of bidding on IFB 95-0056-AA-2-0-KA in the belief that the above Standards
required that the prime contractor be a licensed electrical contractor, employing a licensed master
electrician possessing the above qualifications, as well as me~t the remaining criteria. (Protest, p.2).
                                                 3              Central AnnaturelFort Myer, CAB No. P 478

Central Armature is an electrical contractor licensed in the District and Fort Myers is a construction
firm experienced in mechanical work.

       By letter dated November 26, 1996, the Joint Venture inquired ofDPW whether other bidders
had submitted the information required by Addendum 4. (Protest, Attachment 3).

       By letter dated January 3, 1997, DPW informed the Joint Venture that the Office of
Corporation Counsel had reviewed the submissions of Schlosser and determined it to be responsive
and responsible. (Protest, Attachment 4). The Joint Venture states that it understood this to mean
that DPW:

        had finally received adequate submissions by Schlosser indicating that either it or its
        subcontractor met or exceeded all of the requirements of the Standards, including the
        requirement that the company have a master electrician with minimum qualifying
        experience, that the company have aD. C. electrical license, that the company have
        adequate minimum project qualifications called for, and that Schlosser demonstrated
        that 'the master electrician shall be assigned to the jobsite while the electrical work is
        being performed for the duration of the contract.' If Schlosser itselfcould not make
        such commitments, Joint Venture reasonably presumed .".. . Schlosser had·.
        apprepriately submitted te DC-DPWa written subcentract that its subc.ontract had se
        cemmitted.

(Pretest, p. 3-4).

        On January 21, 1997, Schlesser requested Central Armature te submit a bid te Schlesser en
feur bid items under the IFB. The Jeint Venture centends that these were majer electrical bid items.
On January 28, 1997, the Jeint Venture·filed·its protest with the Beard:

       On February 3, 1997, Jeint Venture meved the Beard fer an Order allewing expedited
discovery.

         On February 13, 1997, Schlesser filed a Metion to Dismiss Protest on the greunds that the
protest is invalid on its face. Schlosser contends that its submittal to DPW on Octeber 15, 1996 met
the Special Standards of Addendum Ne. 4. Further, Schlesser attached te its metion excerpts from
the 1997 Blue Book ofBuilding and Construction fer the Washingten, D. C. area demenstrating that
Central Armature is net only an electrical contracter, but alse provides fan repair, pumps, machine
work and mechanical cempenents. Schlesser asserts that three .of the feur items, fer which Schlosser
seught bids frem Central Armature, included ne electrical werk and that the feurth item, Item 622-
143, ceuld be segregated inte electrical (centrollers) and nen-electrical pertiens (meters). Schlesser
maintains that its president speke te Teny Schmidt .of Central Armature en January 20, 1997, the day
before it telefaxed the list .of feur items fer Central Armature te price, and clearly cemmunicated te
Schmidt that Schlesser seught pricing frem Central Armature fer .only the nen-electrical pertien .of
Item 622-143. Schlesser's metien te dismiss a1se included an October 16, 1996 Hletter .of intent" from
                                                 4               Central AnnaturelFort Myer, CAB No. P 478

Schlosser to Singleton which states, "upon receipt of our prime contract from the. District, we will
send you your subcontract." Attached to the letter of intent is Singleton'S scope of work, which
excluded the motor portion ofItem 622-143 and did not list Items 623-103,623-211 and 640-103.
Schlosser argues that even if it had solicited a price from Central Armature for the electrical portion
ofItem 622-143, Item 622-143 comprises such a small portion of the electrical work on the project
that an award to Schlosser would still be proper.

        On March 3, 1997, the District filed its Agency Report with the following three attachments:
the IFB and amendments, the bid tabulation sheet; and Schlosser's February 12, 1997 Motion to
Dismiss. The Agency Report states that DPW officials had not completed evaluation of Schlosser's
bid and had not yet determined to award the contract to Schlosser.

         On March 5, 1997, the Joint Venture filed an Opposition to Motion to Dismiss Protest,
asserting that Schlosser's October 16, 1996 letter of intent to award a subcontract to Singleton was
insufficient to meet the special standards of responsibility contained in Addendum No 4. The Protester
argues that the letter of intent does not evince an absolute and final commitment by the electrical
contractor so as to satisfy the Special Standard requirements. The Protester argues that the District
cannot find that Schlosser is responsible if the electrical licensee has no binding commitments. 1

        On March 6, 1997, Schlosser filed a pleading entitled "Motion for Summary Disposition,"
asserting that the protest is invalid as a matter of law and that there are no material facts in dispute.
Schlosser's March 6 motion advances the same explanation of its January 20th call to Central
Armature and attaches a notarized affidavit of Andrew Schlosser, president ofW. M. Schlosser, Inc.
Mr. Schlosser asserts:

        7. Prior to bid, Schlosser received quotations and work scopes from two electrical
        subcontractors, M.t. Dean, Inc. and Singleton Electric, Inc ... Both subcontractors
        excluded from their work scopes the furnishing of motors under bid-item 622-143.
        (Attachment C and Df ...




        IThe Protester objected to Schlosser's filing a motion to dismiss, which it pointed out was
the procedural equivalent to a motion for summary jUdgment, an "extreme remedy that is
appropriate only when there are no material facts in issue and when it is clear that the moving
party is entitled to judgment as a matter oflaw." Maddox v. Bano, 422 A.2d 763 (D. C. App.
1980). The Protester argued that there were unresolved factual issues and that the letter of intent
was legally insufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Special Standards. (Opposition to
Motion to Dismiss Protest).

        2Attachment  C and D to Andrew Schlosser's affidavit are work scopes from M. C. Dean
and Singleton Electric respectively. The work scopes confirm Schlosser's statement that both
electrical subcontractors sought to exclude from their scopes of work the furnishing of the motor
portion of item 622- 143.
                                                  5               Central Annature/Fort Myer, CAB No. P 478

         10. On or about January 20, 1997, I called Central Armature to solicit pricing for
        contract work items 622-143 (Motors and Controllers), 623-103 (Fan Rehabilitation),
        623-211 (Fan Diffuser Cowlings), and 640-103 (Replace Fan Discharge Transitions).
        Of these items, only item 622-143 contains any electrical work. I spoke with Tony
        Schmidt of Central Armature. Since we already had an agreement with Singleton to
        perform the electrical portion of item 622-143, I specifically informed Mr. Schmidt that
        I was only soliciting pricing for the non-electrical portion of item 622-143. Mr.
        Schmidt said that he did not know whether Central Armature would be interested in
        submitting a bid, but he asked me to fax him a list of the items that I wanted prices on.

        11. The value. of the electrical portion of contract item 622-143 comprises
        approximately two percent of the electrical work on the project.

Motion for Summary Disposition, Exhibit 1, p. 2.

         On March 18, 1997, Protester filed an Opposition to Motion for Summary Disposition. As
a new ground of protest, Protester argues that the Special Standards require a contractor to have a
Master Electrician in its employ, and that it is not sufficient for a contractor to satisfy those
requirements through a subcontractor. The Joint Venture also objected to a summary disposition
of the case based on Schlosser's factual assertions that only Item 622-143 involves any electrical
work, and that the electrical portion ofItem 622-143 comprises only 2% of the total value of electrical
work of the project. Protester states: "Schlosser's summary conclusions and factual arguments
regarding the scope, value and nature of the electrical work are all evidentiary problems which cannot
be evaluated in the context of a 'Summary D~sposition.' For example, the four bid itelJ:l~ for which
Schlosser has requested Central Armature to bid may all be considered related to a single critical
electrical work item, consisting of an exhaust/discharge/fresh air fan system for the vehicular·tunnels." ....-.... ,.-
(Opposition, p. 3.)

       On April 1, 1997, the Joint Venture filed a pleading entitled "Additional Citations to Authority
in Support of Bid Protest," directing the Board's attention to 27 DCMR ~~ 2201-2206, the District's
procurement regulations on responsibility determinations.

        On April 7, 1997, Schlosser filed its Reply to Opposition to Motion for Summary Disposition
arguing that the Protester's March 18 Opposition raised several new untimely grounds of protest
which the Board should not consider. Schlosser points out that allegations that a contractor cannot
satisfy the special standards through a subcontractor were made well after the 10-day filing
requirement and are therefor~ untimely. Additionally, Schlosser argues that the contract's Special
Standards can be satisfied by the qualifications of a prospective subcontractor. As this ground of
protest was made well after the 10-day filing period, we decline to address it. However, if we were
to address this issue, we would agree with Schlosser's substantive position.

      On April 15, 1997, the Board held a telephone conference with the parties to inquire about
DPW's intention to award the contract. Additionally, we sought to find out if any discovery matters,
                                                  6               Central Annature/Fort Myer, CAB No. P 478

 pursuant to the Protester's February 3, 1997 discovery motion, remained unresolved. The Protester
 indicated that it was not seeking additional discovery.

        On April 17, 1997, DPW's Contracting Officer executed a Determination and Findings ("D
 & F") determining that Schlosser and Singleton were responsible.

        On April 24, 1997, the Board initiated another telephone conference requesting DPW to
 explain the basis of its responsibility D&F, what evidence it considered in determining Singleton's
 commitment to perform as the electrical subcontract, and information about the nature of work Items
 622-143,623-103,623-211 and 640-103.

            By letter dated May 16, 1997, the District submitted an affidavit executed by Gary Burch,
  the Chief Engineer of the District and Administrator, Design, Engineering and Construction
  Administration for DPW. Burch's affidavit states that he considered the information submitted with
  Schlosser's bid, its October 15, 1997 submission of additional information including the list of
  projects completed by Schlosser with references and letters of recommendations, information on key
  personnel from-both companies and information on comparable projects completed by Singleton. He·
  also noted that Schlosser had submitted a copy of Singleton's electrical license: . Burch stated that he
  was familiar with both Schlosser and Singleton because of their past performance of. construction and
  electrical work for DPW. He observed that he had worked as an engineer for th~ District of 32 years
  and that Schlosser had been a responsible contractor during that entire time performing complicated
  work. After his review, Burch determined that Schlosser and Singleton were responsible, and that
  Schlosser met the special responsibility standards by employing a subcontractor with a Master
. Electrician licensed in the District. Further, Bll~ch stated that: Item 623-103 is 9.Q%.mechanical work
  with no electrical work; Item 623-211 and Item 640-103 are both 100% mechanical work with no
  electrical work. Item 622-143 consists of97% electrical work, but only 2% of the total dollar value
  of the contract.

       On May28, 1997, Schlosser filed a copy of its subcontract with Singleton, which was executed
 on March 13, 1997.

         Discussion

         It is well settled that the Board will not overturn an affirmative responsibility determination
unless a protester can show fraud or bad faith on the part of the contracting officials, a bidder's failure
to adhere to definitive responsibility criteria, or that such a determination lacked a reasonable basis.
 See e.g. Dixon Pest Control ~ervices, Inc. CAB No. P-401 Ap. 6, 1994, 42 D.C. Reg. 4528, 4529;
c.P.F, Corp., CAB No. P-413, Nov. 18, 1994,42 D.C. Reg. 4902, 4909. A contracting agency has
broad discretion in determining whether bidders meet definitive responsibility criteria since the agency
must bear the burden of any difficulties experienced in obtaining the required performance. Prime
Mortgage Corp., 69 Compo Gen. 618 (1990), 90-2 CPD ~ 48. When a solicitation contains definitive
responsibility criteria, which are specific and objective standards established by an agency to measure
a bidder's ability to perform a particular contract, the agency must obtain evidence that the bidder
                                                7               Central AnnatureIFort Myer, CAB No. P 478

meets those criteria. UnitedMaterials, Inc. B-243669, 91-2 CPD ~ 161; Calculus, Inc., B-228377.2,
Dec. 7, 1987, 87-2 CPD ~ 558. There is no dispute that the Special Standards contained in
Addendum No.4 constitute definitive responsibility criteria since they established specific and
objective standards.

        The scope of our review is focused on ascertaining whether evidence of compliance has been
submitted from which the contracting officer reasonably could conclude that the definitive
responsibility criteria had been met. The relative quality of the evidence is a matter for the judgment
of the contracting officer. Nevertheless, we also insist on the presence of objective evidence
demonstrating compliance with the definitive responsibility criteria. Tapley Realty Co., Inc., 65 Compo
Gen. 510 (1986) 86-1 CPD ~ 398 .

       . We have reviewed the detailed submissions regarding responsibility, which Schlosser presented
to DPW, including the information on its personnel, past performance on several contracts and the
materials it submitted on Singleton's personnel, past contract performance, and its District of
Columbia electrical license. Finally, we have reviewed the letter of intent from Schlosser to Singleton,
and their subcontract. Since the Special Standards involve matters of responsibility, evidence of
compliance with such provisions may be provided any time up to actual award. Gelco Services, Inc.,
B-253376, Sept. 14, 1993,93-2 CPD ~163, recons. denied, B-253376.2, Oct. 27, 1993,93-2 CPD
~128. Addendum <t. requires a~ontractor to demonstrate the master electrician's commitment to
perform. We find that the letter of intent constituted sufficient evidence of commitment for the
contracting officer to consider Singleton's qualifications in determining whether Schlosser met the
definitive responsibility criteria. See id; Hardie- Tynes Mfg. Co., 69 Compo Gen. 359 (1990), 90-1
CPD ~ 347, affd on reconsid, B-237938.2, Jun~ 25; 1990, 90-2 CPD ~ 587. Further, Schlosser
submitted a subcontract which substantiated its representations that Singleton will perform the
electrical work.

       Accordingly, we deny the protest.
