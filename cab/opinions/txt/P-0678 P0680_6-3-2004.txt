        Atlantic Transportation Equipment, Ltd. (“ATEL”), has protested the award of a letter contract
by the District of Columbia Public Schools (“DCPS”) to Laidlaw Transit, Inc., for the 12 month leasing
of 90 school buses for the 2003-2004 school year. ATEL argues that DCPS made an illegal sole source
award to Laidlaw, that ATEL was capable of meeting the requirements for the procurement, but that
DCPS only issued a solicitation to Laidlaw. DCPS does not claim that this was a competitive
procurement or an emergency procurement. Rather, DCPS states that this was a “single available
source” procurement authorized by 27 DCMR § 1702.1.

        The Procurement Practices Act does not create an exception to competition on the basis of
“single available source” as a method differing from sole source procurements. Accordingly, DCPS
had to justify departing from the competition requirements by meeting the criteria for a sole source
award. We conclude that DCPS has not demonstrated in the record a legitimate basis for conducting a
sole source procurement. ATEL claims that the violations were so serious that the contract to Laidlaw
must be declared void ab initio. Although DCPS violated statutes and regulations, we conclude that the
DCPS violations, when considered in the context of the critical need for buses for the beginning of the
school year, were not so substantial as to render the contract award to Laidlaw void ab initio. We
conclude, nevertheless, that Laidlaw has been performing without a valid contract for over three
months. DCPS never definitized the letter contract, and by late February 2004 the value of Laidlaw’s
performance exceeded both the not-to-exceed amount of the letter contract and the Council’s statutory
review threshold of $1,000,000. Because DCPS has neither requested nor received Council approval,
performance by and payments to Laidlaw after late February 2004 have violated D.C. Code §§ 1-204.51
and 2-301.05a.

       We sustain the protest, directing that DCPS promptly conduct a competition for its current bus
requirements, and that ATEL recover its reasonable proposal preparation costs and costs of pursuing the
consolidated protests.

                                              BACKGROUND

        At the beginning of the 2003-2004 school year, DCPS was required by law to transport 3,790
special education students to their school programs, which are located at over 239 sites in the District,
Maryland, and Virginia. To provide appropriate transportation services, DCPS operates 566 different
bus routes which requires DCPS to acquire and operate a fleet of at least 623 school buses. (Dec. 8,
2003 Determination and Findings to Proceed with Contract Performance,Gilmore Aff. ¶ 4). For prior
school years, Laidlaw and ATEL had been leasing large numbers of school buses to DCPS.

        On May 9, 2003, DCPS issued a Request for Quotation (“RFQ”) for a 12-month lease of an
additional 60 Passenger Class “C” school buses with a deadline for quotations of May 13, 2003. (Joint
Ex. 1). DCPS sent this RFQ to six different vendors, including ATEL and Laidlaw. (Comisiak Dep.
22-24 (Joint Ex. 19)). The RFQ consisted of a facsimile cover page from Walter J. Comisiak, a contract
specialist for DCPS’s Office of Contracts and Acquisitions, and a one-page RFQ, stating in pertinent
part: “Please provide the price for a 12 month lease on class C school buses.” Three different size
buses were specified: 35-Passenger (quantity of 40), 30-Passenger equipped with wheelchair lift
(quantity of 10), and 42-Passenger (quantity of 10). The RFQ asked for the unit price of each size bus
to be quoted as a monthly lease amount for the 12 months.

        On May 12, 2003, Comisiak sent an email to the vendors with the subject line of “60 bus emer.
sol.” making a number of clarifications to the RFQ, including requesting a purchase price per vehicle,
stating that DCPS prefers new buses but that 1999 or newer models with less than 60,000 miles would
be satisfactory, that the vendors “use specifications from Solicitation GAGA 2003-B-0119 as a guide
(doesn’t have to be exact)”, and that vendors “must meet the seating requirements in the RFQ.” (Joint
Ex. 2).

        Comisiak sent ATEL an email on May 30, 2003, with the subject line “Emergency RFQ”,
requesting that ATEL send the quotation information to him and to another DCPS representative.
ATEL’s George Lowe responded minutes later by reply email providing a quotation to DCPS, with
terms for the 60 buses, including a lease period of 12 months, and pricing reflecting the same unit price
recently negotiated between DCPS and ATEL for a 1-year extension to an existing “200+ bus contract.”
Lowe added that ATEL “will require the existing one year contract to be executed and the additional 60
buses to be in a separate contract for 12 months” and that DCPS must verify “that funding for the new
60 bus contract as well as funding for the remaining duration of the 1 year extension contract is in
place.” (Joint Ex. 3). The record does not contain a quotation from Laidlaw but one other vendor
quotation is summarized in a quote tabulation prepared by DCPS. Of the two quotations tabulated,
ATEL’s terms appear to be the more favorable. (Joint Ex. 21).

        Over the following weeks, ATEL and DCPS representatives held numerous discussions and
exchanged emails. The discussions included the clarifications sought by ATEL, such as the DCPS
source of funding for the 60-bus procurement and the bus specifications set forth in the RFQ. Business
terms, including pricing and length of contract were also discussed. ATEL was also concerned about
significant delays in large payments due it from DCPS on other ongoing bus contracts with DCPS.
(Joint Exs. 2-8, 12, 13).
                                                 -3-                      ATEL, CAB Nos. P-0678, P-0680


         On the evening of July 3, 2003, Brian Benton, the Chief Financial Officer of ATEL, received a
phone call from 4 or 5 DCPS representatives including Cedran Kirksey, Kennedy Khobo, and
Fitzgerald Wade. (Joint Ex. 5). DCPS said that the 60 buses that ATEL had bid on were needed right
away, in fact, by Monday morning, July 7. (Joint Ex. 5). Benton reminded the DCPS representatives
that ATEL was still awaiting acceptance of its terms and confirmation of the requested clarifications,
and an update on the status of overdue payments owed to ATEL under its other contracts with DCPS.
(Joint Ex. 5). Benton also stated that it would be difficult to dispatch a fleet of buses on such short
notice. Khobo then proposed that ATEL “lend” DCPS the buses. Benton said that ATEL needed to be
paid its outstanding balance. Khobo said that he would hate to see a newspaper article which indicated
that children did not get picked up as a result of ATEL not providing the buses. (Joint Ex. 5, Benton
Dep. 7-8 (Joint Ex. 22)).

        During the following week there were further conversations and Comisiak set up a meeting on
July 14, 2003. It was attended by an ATEL representative, Comisiak, and some of the DCPS
representatives who had previously spoken to Benton on July 3 inquiring about the delivery of the 60
buses. At the meeting there was further discussion concerning the specifications for the buses and the
funding for the contract. DCPS indicated that the specifications were being relaxed. (Comisiak Dep.
13, 26).

        On July 24, 2003, it appears that Comisiak faxed to Laidlaw a hand-annotated version of the
original May 9 RFQ. (Joint Ex. 27). The only difference appearing on this document was that the
quantity of buses was increased as follows: the quantity of 35-Passenger buses was increased from 40
to 65, the quantity of 30-Passenger buses equipped with wheelchair lifts was increased from 10 to 15,
and the quantity of 42-Passenger buses remained the same at 10. Thus, the RFQ sought a 12-month
lease price for a total of 90 buses.

       Comisiak and the DCPS contracting officer, Annie Watkins, recall hearing, probably from
Fitzgerald Wade of DCPS, about an increased requirement of 90 rather than 60 buses, sometime in late
July 2003. (Watkins Dep. 12-14; Comisiak Dep. 52-57). Watkins thought she instructed Comisiak
around July 30, 2003, to send an informal request for quotation to both Laidlaw and ATEL for the new
90-bus requirement. Comisiak thought he sent the requirement to both Laidlaw and ATEL around July
30. (Id.).

        We find from the record that Comisiak inexplicably failed to fax to ATEL the same hand-
annotated RFQ that apparently he faxed to Laidlaw on July 24. Unfortunately, Comisiak was not
questioned about the July 24, 2003 RFQ found at Joint Ex. 27 at the time of his deposition because
DCPS could not locate any RFQ or solicitation for the 90-bus requirement until the Board ordered
DCPS to obtain such documents from Laidlaw. DCPS did not obtain Laidlaw’s documents until the
end of the hearing on March 10, 2004, which was conducted to obtain testimony from David Gilmore,
the DCPS Transportation Administrator.

       In an email sent to Laidlaw representatives bearing a date of July 30, 2003, and a time of 8:27
a.m., Comisiak, stated the following: “Please provide price and delivery for 95 buses w/ maintenance.
ASAP. Thanks; Walt.” (Joint Ex. 29). Laidlaw responded at 8:50 a.m.:

       Walt – Do you have any specs for the buses or the term of the lease (should we assume
                                                 -4-                      ATEL, CAB Nos. P-0678, P-0680


       1 year)? I assume we could roll these additional buses into our existing (unsigned) lease
       agreement. Please let me know ASAP. Thanks! -- Steve”

(Joint Ex. 29). The Laidlaw representative responding to the July 30 email apparently was unaware of
the earlier July 24, 2003 hand-annotated RFQ that had been faxed to another office of Laidlaw.

        Although Comisiak thought that he must have sent a similar email request to ATEL for the 90
(or 95) bus requirement, he could find no evidence of sending such an email, and ATEL states that it
never received any email. We find that DCPS failed to send to ATEL the hand-annotated RFQ, or any
document indicating the new requirements, at any point in July 2003.

        Meanwhile, however, ATEL had arranged for a meeting on July 30, 2003, with David Gilmore,
the recently court-appointed Transportation Administrator for DCPS, and Patrick Kean, Gilmore’s chief
operating officer, to discuss the large payments DCPS owed to ATEL on its existing bus contracts.
Attending the meeting for ATEL were Brian Connolly, its CEO, and George Lowe, its consultant for
the bus contracts. Gilmore had been appointed Transportation Administrator by order of the United
States District Court on June 25, 2003. (Joint Ex. 25; Hearing Tr. 6-7). At the meeting, Gilmore
opened by asking Connolly, “Where’s my buses?” (Lowe Dep. 15). Lowe responded, “Where’s our
money?” (Lowe Dep. 17-18). ATEL also inquired whether DCPS had a source of funding to acquire
the 60 buses it was now soliciting. (Lowe Dep. 15). Gilmore advised the ATEL representatives that
the bus requirements had changed from 60 to 90 buses based on a recent DCPS report. (Lowe Dep. 14).
 This was the first indication ATEL had that the requirement was for 90, rather than 60, buses. During
the meeting, Gilmore shared with the ATEL representatives a copy of the United States District Court
order appointing him as Transportation Administrator for DCPS. (Lowe Dep. 17). Gilmore stated that
he intended to use funds from the $11 million account that was established under the court order to
bring DCPS’s overdue account with ATEL current. (Lowe Dep. 19). The same $11 million account
would be used to fund the new bus requirement. Gilmore indicated that he had authority to make
procurement commitments on behalf of DCPS. (Hearing Tr. 28-29; Lowe Dep. 18; Benton Dep. 14-
15). Gilmore later testified that although the court order provided him contracting authority, he would
use DCPS ancillary services such as procurement and would make use of his contracting authority only
if DCPS’s contracting office was unable to timely execute the procurements that were needed.
(Hearing Tr. 45-47).

        When Connelly and Lowe indicated that ATEL was willing to proceed based upon Gilmore’s
assurances, the ATEL representatives and Gilmore then discussed at least one term concerning the
anticipated contract, namely the length of the contract. ATEL proposed a term of 60 months. Although
the testimony is conflicting, we find it more likely than not that Gilmore took no position but merely
asked his associate, Kean, to “work out the details” with ATEL. Thus, it was understood by the
meeting attendees that ATEL would submit a proposal after clarifying the details with Kean for the 90-
bus requirement. (Lowe Dep. 22). Gilmore most likely knew about and recommended the actions
taken by the DCPS contracting office starting in early to mid-July 2003. (Comisiak Dep. 64). He
probably also knew about and perhaps directed that an RFQ for the 90 buses be sent to Laidlaw. He
most likely gave instructions that directly or indirectly prompted Comisiak to email Laidlaw about the
new bus requirement on July 30, coincidentally at the time Gilmore’s meeting with ATEL was in
progress.
                                                   -5-                       ATEL, CAB Nos. P-0678, P-0680


        ATEL states that it immediately began procuring (or at least identifying) the necessary 90 buses.
Lowe attempted several times unsuccessfully to reach Kean by telephone after the meeting to work out
the details of the proposal. Although ATEL representatives were unable to reach Kean, ATEL
nevertheless submitted a letter proposal to Kean on August 4, 2003, reflecting the discussions Lowe and
Connolly had with Gilmore during the July 30 meeting. ATEL quoted a price of $1,901 per month per
“full-sized” vehicle for a 60-month lease-maintenance term. DCPS assumed that the price applied to a
48 passenger bus, but ATEL did not specify the size of the buses that it would be providing perhaps
because it did not know the specifications for the 90 buses. That information was contained in the July
24 hand-annotated RFQ but ATEL never received that document or any other written form of
solicitation or RFQ for the 90-bus requirement. (Lowe Dep. 36).

         Laidlaw responded to the July 24 hand-annotated RFQ in a letter dated August 1, 2003, with a
listing of the 90 specific buses that it proposed to provide. It quoted the same per vehicle per year price
contained in its existing lease-maintenance agreement with DCPS. (Joint Ex. 9). On a monthly basis,
the price was $1,827.43. Laidlaw modified its response by letter dated August 5, 2003, providing
information about delivery, including possible delivery delays. (Joint Ex. 11).

         The DCPS contracting officer, Annie Watkins, testified that the 90-bus requirement was a new
and different requirement and that the prior 60-bus RFQ was “dead” as of August 1, 2003. (Watkins
Dep. 34-35 (Joint Ex. 23)). Watkins understood ATEL’s August 4, 2003 letter (Joint Ex. 10) to be its
bid in response to the new 90-bus procurement. (Watkins Dep. 35). By emails exchanged on August 5,
2003, ATEL (Mr. Lowe) asked DCPS “when is my contract going to be available?” DCPS (Mr.
Comisiak) responded, “When I say so.” (Joint Ex. 12).

        Gilmore and DCPS had determined that DCPS would only consider a 12-month lease. The facts
show that neither Gilmore nor DCPS communicated to ATEL that its 60-month lease term proposal for
the 90-bus requirement would not be considered unless the term was 12 months. Watkins testified that
she never discussed with ATEL whether ATEL would have been willing to quote the 90 buses under a
12-month lease arrangement rather than the 60-month term provided in its letter proposal. (Watkins
Dep. 31). It is also clear that Comisiak never discussed with ATEL whether ATEL would have been
willing to price the 90 buses under a 12-month lease term. (Id.) We accept Lowe’s testimony that
DCPS never told ATEL that it would consider offers for the 90-bus procurement only if the offered
term was 12 months or less. (Lowe Dep. 38). ATEL states that it would have quoted a price using a
12-month lease term if it had known that to be a requirement. Indeed, it previously had quoted a 12-
month lease term for the 60-bus RFQ.

       DCPS awarded Letter Contract No. GAGA-2004-C-0014 to Laidlaw on August 15, 2004. (Joint
Ex. 14). The letter contract provides that Laidlaw was to lease to and maintain 90 buses for DCPS for
the period August 27, 2003, through August 26, 2004, with a monthly vehicle lease/maintenance
payment of $164,468.67. (Joint Ex. 14, at 4 (Section B.1)). The letter contract also states:

       DCPS intends to definitize this letter contract within 60 days from date of award of this
       letter contract, at which time this letter contract shall merge with the definitized
       contract. Before expiration of the 60 days, the Contracting Officer may authorize an
       additional period in accordance with [27 DCMR 2425.9] . . . . If DCPS does not
       definitize this letter contract within 60 days of the date of award . . . or any extension
                                                    -6-                        ATEL, CAB Nos. P-0678, P-0680


       thereof, this letter contract shall expire. In the event of expiration of this letter contract,
       DCPS shall pay the Contractor for the services performed under this letter contract in an
       amount not to exceed $328,937.40 In no event shall the amount paid under this letter
       contract or any extension thereof exceed (50%) of the total definitized contract amount.

       The duration of the definitized contract shall be from date of award through one year
       thereafter. DCPS shall pay the Contractor for services performed during the first year of
       the definitized contract in an amount not to exceed $1,973,619.90.

(Joint Ex. 14, at 1). The letter contract provided the following timeline for definitizing the contract:

       September 1, 2003:               Transmit definitive contract to Contractor for signature.
       September 5, 2003:               Transmit definitive contract to Board of Education for approval.
       September 16, 2003:              Transmit definitive contract to City Council for Approval.
       October 1, 2003:                 Award definitive contract.

         Also on August 15, DCPS’s Chief Procurement Officer, Debor Dosunmu, and Watkins executed
a determination and findings (“D&F”) in regard to the award of Contract No. GAGA-2004-C-0014.
The D&F cites 27 DCMR § 1702.3(b) as “authorization.” That provision authorizes a procurement on a
sole source basis “based on the particular source’s ownership or control of limited rights in data, patent
rights, copyrights or trade secrets related to the required supplies.” The D&F implies that Laidlaw is
the only available source capable of supplying the buses in the timeframe needed by DCPS. (Joint Ex.
15).

       On Tuesday, August 19, 2003, Lowe learned that additional school buses were arriving at the
DCPS lot on New York Avenue. (Lowe Dep. 38; Joint Ex. 18). On September 2, 2003, ATEL filed
with the Board its initial protest of the award by DCPS to Laidlaw. (CAB No. P-0678). On October
10, 2003, ATEL filed a supplemental protest (CAB No. P-0680), alleging that DCPS had not received
approval from the Council pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-301.05a (requiring Council approval for contracts
in excess of $1,000,000) for the Laidlaw contract. The Board consolidated the two protests. In a
January 8, 2004 filing, DCPS responded to the supplemental protest ground as follows:

       The amount to be paid to the Contractor under the definitized contract is $1,973,619.90.
       The letter contract has not yet been definitized. Therefore, the maximum amount that
       could be paid under the letter contract is $986,809.95, or 50% of the definitized amount.
       Thus, D.C. Code Ann. § 2-301.05a is not implicated because the amount of the letter
       contract can not exceed $1,000,000.

        The parties attempted to settle the protests but those efforts were unsuccessful. The Board
conducted a hearing on March 10, 2004, to receive the testimony of David Gilmore. The parties
thereafter filed closing briefs and replies.

        On June 2, 2004, the Board conducted a telephone conference with the parties to inquire about
whether the letter contract with Laidlaw had ever been definitized and submitted to the Council for
approval. DCPS counsel states that Laidlaw is still providing the 90 buses to DCPS purportedly under
the letter contract. DCPS explains that it decided not to definitize the letter contract and intended
                                                   -7-                       ATEL, CAB Nos. P-0678, P-0680


merely to let the letter contract expire at the end of the anticipated definitized contract term of August
26, 2004. In response to the Board’s inquiries regarding any extension of the letter contract, DCPS
submitted 6 modifications of the letter contract (documents that DCPS should have previously filed as
part of its ongoing obligation to advise the Board of any changes to the contract at issue). Modification
No. 1, dated October 13, 2003, extended the term of the letter contract through November 30, 2003, and
increased the price from $328,937.40 to $581,122.04. Modification No. 2, dated November 21, 2003,
extended the term of the letter contract through January 31, 2004, and increased the price to
$897,146.64. Modification No. 3, dated February 26, 2004 (with an effective date of February 1, 2004),
extended the term of the letter contract through February 29, 2004, and purported to increase the price
to $1,048,611.90, but also contradictorily states that “the total letter contract value remains unchanged.”
 Modification No. 4, also dated February 26, 2004 (with an effective date of February 1, 2004),
purported to extend the term of the letter contract through May 31, 2004, and to increase the price to
$1,529,122.38. Like Modification No. 3, it contains the statement that “the total letter contract value
remains unchanged.” Modification No. 5, dated March 5, 2004, “corrects the amount stated for each
preceding modification” and purports to increase the price to $1,569,194.22. Modification No. 6, dated
April 30, 2004 (with an effective date of March 5, 2004), purports to extend the term of the letter
contract through June 30, 2004, and to increase the price to $1,736,817.11. It contains the statement
that “the total letter contract value remains unchanged.” All of the modifications are signed by
Watkins, the DCPS contracting officer.

                                                 DISCUSSION

       We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03(a)(1).

        DCPS takes the position that the contracting officers in this matter correctly determined, based
on the information presented to them, that Laidlaw was the only supplier of buses that was available to
supply DCPS the 90 buses it needed for a one-year lease term at that time. DCPS points out that
ATEL’s proposal for a 60-month lease was inconsistent with DCPS’s requirement for a 12-month lease
term. Laidlaw’s proposal correctly quoted the buses for a 12-month lease term. The problem with
DCPS’s argument is that the contracting officers and the contract specialist all admitted that ATEL was
capable of providing the buses. The reason ATEL did not quote a 12-month term is that it was never
informed by DCPS that a 12-month term was required. ATEL never received the hand-annotated RFQ
of July 24, 2003, because Comisiak and the contracting officers never followed through to make sure
that both suppliers had received the same RFQ. ATEL had quoted a 12-month term for the original 60-
bus RFQ and there is nothing in the record to suggest that ATEL was incapable of quoting under the
same terms for the 90-bus requirement. It did not do so because Gilmore asked ATEL at the July 30
meeting what terms it wished to have for a contract and ATEL had proposed a 60-month lease. Further,
when ATEL attempted to contact Kean, who was Gilmore’s assistant, to work out the details of the
proposal, Kean never responded and ATEL was forced to submit a proposal with no guidance as to the
length of the lease term as well as the quantities of the various sizes of the 90 buses needed by DCPS.
To compound the error, Comisiak sent an email request for a quote to Laidlaw on July 30 but did not
send a similar email to ATEL. After Laidlaw had submitted a quote on August 1 and ATEL had
submitted a quote on August 4, it had to have been clear to the contracting officers and the contract
specialist that the suppliers were not quoting to the same terms and specifications. Instead of contacting
ATEL and asking it to resubmit a quotation according to the desired terms and bus specifications,
DCPS’s contracting officials did nothing to obtain a level of competition that was easily obtainable.
                                                  -8-                       ATEL, CAB Nos. P-0678, P-0680


DCPS ignored ATEL’s inquiries and went ahead with an award to Laidlaw.

        DCPS cites 27 DCMR § 1702. as its authority for making an award based on Laidlaw being the
single available source. We do not agree with DCPS that the single available source authority is by
nature something different from a sole source award. On the contrary, it is simply a species of a sole
source award and therefore must meet the requirements for a sole source award. The Procurement
Practices Act mandates fair and open competition in procurements except in very limited circumstances
such as a sole source procurement authorized by D.C. Code § 2-303.05 which provides:

              (a) Procurement contracts may be awarded through noncompetitive negotiations
       when under rules implementing this section, the Director or the Director's designee
       determines in writing that one of the following conditions exists:

               (1) There is only 1 source for the required commodity, service, or construction
       item;

               (2) The contract is for the purchase of real property or interests in real property;

               (3) The contract is with a vendor who maintains a price agreement or schedule
       with any federal agency, so long as no contract executed under this provision authorizes
       a price higher than is contained in the contract between the federal agency and the
       vendor;

              (3A) The contract is with a vendor who agrees to adopt the same pricing
       schedule for the same services or goods as that of a vendor who maintains a price
       agreement or schedule with any federal agency, if no contract executed under this
       paragraph authorizes a price higher than is contained in the contract between the federal
       agency and the vendor; or

              (4) Contracts for the purchase of commodities, supplies, equipment, or
       construction services that would ordinarily be purchased on a competitive basis when an
       emergency has been declared pursuant to § 2-303.12.

        DCPS did not meet the requirements for a sole source award in this case. The DCPS contracting
officers and the contract specialist conceded that the only reason for awarding to Laidlaw was that
Laidlaw had proposed a 12-month lease term and ATEL had proposed a 60-month lease term. But, it is
equally clear that ATEL was never given an opportunity to propose a 12-month lease term for the 90-
bus requirement. Indeed, ATEL was not even provided the quantities of buses by passenger size and
specifications. Watkins’ reason for not issuing a solicitation under the provisions for competitive
sealed proposals is that she believed that neither supplier could deliver all 90 buses on short notice and
that DCPS would therefore simply negotiate a modification of their existing (and apparently
unexecuted) contracts and add additional buses to those contracts. But, in fact, DCPS did not add the
90 buses to the existing Laidlaw and ATEL contracts but rather executed a single new contract with
Laidlaw.

       The DCPS contracting personnel stated that the procurement of the 90 buses was not an
                                                  -9-                      ATEL, CAB Nos. P-0678, P-0680


emergency procurement as defined in D.C. Code § 2-303.12(a). DCPS contracting officials never
prepared a determination declaring an emergency procurement as required by D.C. Code § 2-
303.12(a)(3). In any event, even under what appeared to be emergency conditions here, DCPS could
have and should have obtained competition from at least Laidlaw and ATEL. If DCPS had sent the
same hand-annotated July 24 RFQ to both Laidlaw and ATEL, it would have achieved a reasonable
measure of competition between these two suppliers.

       In sum, DCPS violated basic procurement law by failing to justify the sole source award to
Laidlaw, failing to use a competitive method for procuring the buses, failing to provide the same terms
and specifications to the suppliers who were capable of competing, and failing to treat each of the
suppliers in a fair and equal manner.

        For the reasons discussed above, we sustain ATEL’s consolidated protests. ATEL asserts that
the violations were so substantial as to render the award to Laidlaw void ab initio. We find that the
actions of DCPS were arbitrary and irrational, but we decline to conclude that the violations render the
contract void ab initio.

         Some of the errors resulted from a lack of diligence and poor contracting practices while others
resulted from the unique situation of a newly court-appointed Transportation Administrator facing a
critical need for additional buses with a new school year ready to begin. The contracting officer claims
that she instructed the contract specialist to send the 90-bus requirement to both ATEL and Laidlaw.
The contract specialist states that he thought he did send the requirement to both. The contracting
officers and the contract specialist did not maintain proper records, being unable to produce any of the
materials sent to Laidlaw or allegedly sent to ATEL. Only after we ordered DCPS to obtain the critical
documentation from Laidlaw, which Laidlaw had in its files, were we able piece together some of the
key events in the procurement. The contracting officer is responsible for making sure that
procurements are properly done. The communications by the contracting office with the suppliers were
vague, incomplete, replete with errors, carelessly transmitted, lacking proper instructions, and not
maintained in the contract file. The contracting officer was not diligent in following up with the
contract specialist to make sure that both suppliers had received the same requirements information
against which to submit a quotation. And after the proposals (Laidlaw’s August 1 proposal and
ATEL’s August 4 proposal) were submitted, the contracting officer certainly should have realized that
DCPS had not provided the same information to both suppliers. At that point, the contracting officer
should have contacted ATEL and discovered why it quoted a 60-month term rather than a 12-month
term, and why it did not specify the quantities and specifications for the buses. With those actions,
DCPS would have learned that ATEL did not receive the July 24 hand-annotated RFQ, and DCPS could
have instructed ATEL to resubmit its quotation based on the RFQ rather than on the verbal and
undefined terms given to ATEL by Gilmore.

       As mentioned above, part of the problem also stems from the fact that the DCPS procurement
personnel (contracting officer and contract specialist) were dealing with Laidlaw, while the court-
appointed Transportation Administrator (Gilmore) was dealing (on a single occasion, i.e., July 30) with
ATEL at the critical time for the 90-bus procurement. ATEL was unable to get clear specifications
from Gilmore or his assistant, Kean, the DCPS contracting office withheld vital information from
ATEL, and ATEL did not know that DCPS contracting personnel were dealing with Laidlaw. Both
suppliers thought that they were in individual negotiations for the 90-bus requirement. As a result,
                                                 - 10 -                   ATEL, CAB Nos. P-0678, P-0680


there was confusion among not only the bus suppliers (principally ATEL) but also Gilmore and the
DCPS contracting office. Gilmore testified that he did not use the contracting authority he was granted
in the court order which appointed him but in fact his “recommendations” were acted upon by the
contracting officers and the contract specialist. In any event, it was the DCPS contracting officer, not
Gilmore, who executed the letter contract with Laidlaw.

       At this point, termination as a remedy is moot. The August 2003 letter contract that DCPS
signed with Laidlaw has no legal force. By its terms, it was to be effective for 60 days, subject to
extensions pursuant to 27 DCMR § 2425.9, which provides:

       The contracting officer shall execute a definitive contract within one hundred and
       twenty (120) days after the date of execution of the letter contract or before completion
       of fifty percent (50%) of the work to be performed, whichever occurs first. The
       contracting officer may authorize an additional period if the additional period is
       approved in writing by the head of the contracting agency.

       DCPS has submitted extensions purportedly through June 30, 2004. However, the letter
contract provides that in no event shall the amount paid under the letter contract or any extension
exceed 50 percent of the total definitized contract amount of $1,973,619.90. Thus, the letter contract
had a not-to-exceed amount of $986,809.95, which is less than the $1,000,000 threshold for Council
approval under District law. Normally, only definitized contracts are submitted to the Council. D.C.
Code § 1-204.51 (formerly D.C. Code § 1-1130 (2001)) provides in relevant part:

       (b) Contracts exceeding certain amount.

                (1) In general. -- No contract involving expenditures in excess of $ 1,000,000
       during a 12-month period may be made unless the Mayor submits the contract to the
       Council for its approval and the Council approves the contract (in accordance with
       criteria established by act of the Council).

In addition, D.C. Code § 2-301.05a (entitled “Criteria for Council review of multiyear contracts and
contracts in excess of $1 million”) (formerly D.C. Code § 1-1181.5a (2001)) provides in part:

               (a) Pursuant to § 1-204.51, prior to the award of a multiyear contract or a
       contract in excess of $ 1,000,000 during a 12-month period, the Mayor or executive
       independent agency or instrumentality shall submit the proposed contract to the Council
       for review and approval in accordance with the criteria established in this section.

               ....

                (d) After July 28, 1995, no proposed multiyear contract or lease and no proposed
       contract or lease worth over $ 1,000,000 for a 12-month period may be awarded until
       after the Council has reviewed and approved the proposed contract or lease as provided
       in this section.

               (e) After July 28, 1995, any employee or agency head who shall knowingly or
                                                  - 11 -                    ATEL, CAB Nos. P-0678, P-0680


       willfully enter into a proposed multiyear contract or a proposed contract or lease in
       excess of $ 1,000,000 without prior Council review and approval in accordance with
       this section shall be subject to suspension, dismissal, or other disciplinary action under
       the procedures set forth in § 1-616.01(d)(1) and (18). This subsection shall apply to
       subordinate agency heads appointed according to subchapter X-A of Chapter 6 of Title
       1, and to independent agency heads.

               (f)(1) No contractor who knowingly or willfully performs on a contract with the
       District by providing a product or service worth in excess of $ 1,000,000 for a 12-month
       period based on a contract made after July 28, 1995, without prior Council approval, can
       be paid more than $ 1,000,000 for the products or services provided.

        Modification No. 3, which extended the term of the letter contract through February 29, 2004,
exceeded the not-to-exceed amount by nearly $62,000, and also exceeded the $1,000,000 contract
threshold for Council review and approval. There is no evidence in the record that DCPS even sought
Council approval. DCPS explains that it decided not to definitize the letter contract and intended
merely to let the letter contract expire at the end of the anticipated definitized contract term of August
26, 2004. The problem with this approach, as just stated, is that the value of services during the past 9
months has far exceeded the letter contract’s not-to-exceed amount and the statutory threshold of
$1,000,000 for Council approval. Those thresholds were exceeded by late February 2004.
Accordingly, Laidlaw has been performing without a valid contract since then. Because DCPS has
never received Council approval, performance by and payments to Laidlaw after late February 2004
violate D.C. Code §§ 1-204.51 and 2-301.05a. See Second Genesis, Inc., CAB No. D-1100, Feb. 4,
2000, 48 D.C. Reg. 1480, 1489.

        DCPS states that Laidlaw is still providing the 90 buses to DCPS purportedly under the letter
contract. Because there is no valid contract for Laidlaw’s current performance, we direct DCPS to
promptly compete its requirements for at least the remainder of the intended definitized contract term.
We understand that there is an outstanding DCPS solicitation for a major acquisition of approximately
580 buses. It is for DCPS to decide how best it will meet its current and future requirements using
valid, competitive procurement procedures.

        Pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.08(f)(2), we award ATEL its reasonable proposal preparation
costs and cost of pursing the consolidated protests. ATEL submitted a request for $196,795, consisting
of $95,570 for labor hours incurred by ATEL’s CEO, CFO, and staff, and another $101,225 billed by
ATEL’s consultant (George Lowe). We have reviewed ATEL’s submission and DCPS’s response to
that submission. We find that ATEL has not properly documented its request for costs. To verify costs,
the Board requires that a protester:

       (1) submit the names of its employees who worked on the bid or proposal, (2) identify
       and describe the tasks performed, (3) submit documentation supporting the hourly rates
       and number of hours worked, and (4) document overhead and fringe benefits. In so
       doing, we also require an affidavit or verified statement from one or more of the
       protestor’s principals, which contains the explanations of costs incurred. … We do not
       mean to indicate that we require precise mathematical certainty in order to award bid or
       proposal preparation costs. However, we will not base awards on unsubstantiated
                                                  - 12 -                     ATEL, CAB Nos. P-0678, P-0680


       claims by the protestor which engage the Board in mere speculation.

Tito Contractors, Inc., CAB No. 363, Aug. 12, 1993, 41 D.C. Reg. 3597; see also Recycling Solutions,
Inc., CAB No. 377, June 30, 1995, 42 D.C. Reg. 4990. Further, the amount claimed must be
reasonable. “[A] claim is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, the costs do not exceed those that
would be incurred by a prudent person in pursuit of a protest.” Galen Medical Associates, Inc., B-
288661.6, July 22, 2002, 2002 CPD ¶ 114. ATEL’s submission does not include required
documentation of the names of the employees, an explanation of what each employee did, support for
the employee labor costs, a breakdown of the staff who incurred labor hours, and either payroll
documentation establishing the hours incurred or affidavits from each attesting to the labor hours
incurred. All we have is a single affidavit from Brian Benton, the CFO, with an attached exhibit
(Exhibit A) which lists brief activity descriptions and numbers of hours in three categories, “CEO”,
“CFO”, and “Staff.” Nor is there any explanation of the “freight” cost of $6,000 contained in the same
exhibit. Finally, the only support for the $101,225 fee of George Lowe of Van Scoyoc Associates, Inc.,
is an undated letter from Lowe to Benton (Exhibit B) stating that “our fees incurred to date with respect
to the bid protest which has been on-going since August 2004 through current date presently aggregate
$101,225.00.” Billing records are needed for Lowe describing activities and hours incurred by date,
evidence of billing rate, and a specification of the amount, date, and reason for incurring each cost other
than labor.

        The parties shall negotiate the appropriate amount due ATEL and DCPS shall promptly pay the
agreed upon amount. If the parties cannot agree, they shall present the matter to the Board for
resolution.

       SO ORDERED.
