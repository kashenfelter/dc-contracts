        Two prospective contractors, Ideal Electronic Security Company and AccuTech Systems, Inc.,
protested the decision of the District of Columbia Public Schools ("DCPS") to award Simplex Time
Recorder Company ("Simplex") a contract under Solicitation No. DCPS-R-98036-OS for a closed circuit
television surveillance system at various public schools. The protesters contend that DCPS improperly
evaluated the proposals and improperly determined Simplex to be the only offeror within the competitive
range.                                                    • •

        We conclude that DCPS violated no law or regulation in its evaluation of the proposals and that
the record does not show that the technical evaluation of the proposals was either irrational or arbitrary.
The evaluation and scoring ultimately adopted by the contracting officer was consistent with the evaluation
scheme established in the solicitation., Accordingly, we deny the consolidated protests.

                                            BACKGROUND

         On June 5,1998, DCPS issued Solicitation No. DCPS-R-98036-OS for a closed circuit television
surveillance system at various public school locations. (Agency Report ("AR") Ex. 1). Section M.3 of the
solicitation defined the selection criteria and corresponding values as follows:

        Five prospective contractors submitted responsive proposals by the solicitation' s closing date and
timeonJuly20, 1998. Proposals were submitted by Ideal, AccuTech, Simplex, Cardkey Systems, Inc.,
and Condortech Services, Inc. (AR at 3). On July 22, 1998, a technical evaluation panel ("TEP")
appointed by the contracting officer reviewed the five proposals. According to instructions from the
contracting officer, the evaluators first independently evaluated and scored each proposal. (AR Ex. 7).
Based on all technical and price criteria, and including the 1 8 LSDBE points for which Ideal qualified, and
correcting various arithmetic errors by two of the evaluators, the five proposals had the following average
scores arrived at independently by each e valuator:                       ;,

        Next, the TEP met "to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal with the obj ective
of reaching a consensus on its merits and (deficiencies, relative to the evaluation criteria/factors." (AR Ex.
7). The TEP members met and discussed the offerers and their proposals, including strengths and
weaknesses for each. During the discussion, one member identified deficiencies in Ideal' s proposed

cameras and video multiplexors and performance problems on one prior contract. (AR Supp. Ex. 18).2
In the course of this consensus evaluation meeting, the TEP rhembers then rescored the proposals based
on their discussions. The panel members state that their detailed collective technical discussion and
reassessment highlighted technical deficiencies in some of the proposals, including Ideal's, that were not
noted by various members during their individual assessments. Ideal's consensus technical score was 3 7
points lower than its average technical score from the TEP individual evaluations, decreasing from 110.24
to 73. The decrease was primarily under the criteria for operational capacity and technical approach which
decreased by a total of 34 points.between them. Simplex's consensus technical score was about 5 points
higher than its average technical score from the individual evaluations by the TEP members. The following
summarizes the results of the consensus scoring:                 ,

(AREx. 9; AREx. 13, at 5; ARat5). The TEP recommended that the competitive range be limited to
Simplex, because the other offerers had no reasonable chance of supplanting Simplex as the highest ranked
offerer in terms of technical and price. On July 22,1998, the contracting officer met with the TEP and
discussed their consensus evaluations, scoring, and recommendations. The contracting officer agreed with
the TEP because the next closest two offerers, though close in technical scoring, were far lower in the price
scoring because they offered prices 200 and 300 percent higher than that offered by Simplex. Ideal and
AccuTech were considered to be too weak under the technical criteria. (AR Ex. 11; AR Supp. Ex. 18).                f


         On July 24 and July 29,1998, the contracting officer conducted negotiations with Simplex,
requested a BAFO, and received Simplex' BAFO on July 31,1998. The contracting officer determined
that the BAFO price offered by Simplex was fair and reasonable and thereafter awarded a contract on
Augusts, 1998.                                      ,.   , :!

 Exhibit 18, consisting of affidavits from the contracting officer and three of the evaluators, was filed as
part of the District's October 5, 1998 response to Ideal's comments on the Agency Report.

         In determining the propriety of an evaluation and selection decision, We examine the record to;
determine whether the decision was reasonable and in accord with the evaluation criteria listed in the
solicitation and whether there were any violations of procurement laws or regulations. Health Right, Inc.,
CABNo.P-507,Oct. 15,1997,9 P.D. 7372,7395. Implicit in the foregoing is that the evaluation and'
selection decision must be documented in sufficient detail to show that it is not arbitrary. Id.; Southwest
Marine, 96-1 CPD1 56; S&MProperly Management, B-243051, June 28, 1991, 91-1 CPD U 615.
In particular, the agency's technical evaluation documentation is required to include an analysis of the
technically acceptable and unacceptable proposals, including an assessment of each offerer's ability to
accomplish the technical requirements.                       -

         Ideal argues the contracting officer improperly relied on the subjective opinion of one TEP member
concerning Ideal's past performance on another contract, in justifying (lie significant decrease in its technical
scores (from the individual assessments to the consensus assessment) and its elimination from the
competitive range. That argument does not take account of the additional supplementation offered by the
District, including the affidavits of three of the TEP members and the contracting officer. Ideal argues that
we should disregard those materials because they were submitted well after the Agency Report and after
Ideal had responded to the Agency Report. Although we agree with Ideal that the record, as it existed
prior to the District's last supplementation, did not adequately document the evaluation and selection
process, at least with regard to the consensus evaluation of Ideal, we believe that the supplemental affidavits
provide adequate explanation for the recommendations of the TEP and the evaluation and selection
decision of the contracting officer. These affidavits should have been prepared and submitted as part of
the Agency Report. Nevertheless, we will not exclude them from the record because it appears that no
debriefing occurred and no depositions were conducted of the relevant District personnel. Thus, the key
protest issues did not crystallize until after the Agency Report and its exhibits were served on Ideal. When
Ideal pointed out in its comments on the Agency Report that the record lacked substantial information
supporting Ideal's consensus evaluation and scoring, the District responded with the supplemental affidavits.

         In other circumstances, post-Agency Report amplifications might not carry significant weight: Here;
however, the facts set forth in the affidavits are consistent with the contracting officer's earlier and poorly
documented conclusions. The affidavits also explain the rather vague comment in the TEP final report that
the "detailed collective technical assessment highlighted technical deficiencies that were not noted in the
individual assessments'' - a reference primarily to the significant difference between the consensus technical
scoring and the average of the individual technical assessments of Ideal, and the comment that "Ideal's past
performance rating was reduced based upon the technical expert member' s knowledge of the company."
More importantly, Ideal has not rebutted the statements contained in the affidavits which detail deficiencies
in the cameras, and video multiplexors proposed by Ideal. For these reasons, we have permitted the
District to supplement the record and we find that the supplemental affidavits provide an adequate rationale
for the recommendations of the TEP and the competitive range and selection determinations made by the
contracting officer.

        There is no indication in the record that either the TEP or the contracting officer considered criteria
other than those provided in the solicitation. Thus, the argument that DCPS did not evaluate according to
                                                                                                                 [7651]

the specified criteria is without merit, AccuTech's argument that its price was lower than that of Simplex's
and that AccuTech's technical offering met the specification requirements does not contradict the
determination of the contracting officer and the TEP that Simplex had the best offering, considering all price
and technical criteria, therefore, AccuTech's protest does not state a meritorious ground.

                                             CONCLUSION

        The consolidated protests are denied.
