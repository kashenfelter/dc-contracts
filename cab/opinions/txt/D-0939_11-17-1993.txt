                                                 OPINION

       By this appeal, Heller Electric Co., Inc. (Heller), on behalf of its subcontractor
Associated Builders, Inc. (Associated) and Associated's painting subcontractor P.M. Ballard,
Inc. (Ballard), requests an equitable adjustment to its contract with District of Columbia
Public Schools (DCPS) in the amount of $31,334.65 plus interest, for the purchase of
additional paintY Heller appeals the decision of the Superintendent of Schools, which
upheld the decision of the contracting officer (A.F. A)Y


Findings of Fact

             1.     The contract at issue was for the electrical modernization at River
Terrace and Noyes Elementary Schools in the amount of $1,199,500.00 and $35,000.00 per
addendum No.3, for a total of $1,234,500.00. Work was to start on September 8, 1992 and
to be completed within 270 calendar days or by May 27, 1993. The contract was signed by
the Superintendent of Schools on November 25, 1992. (A.F. B).

               2.     The parties have jointly stipulated that Heller entered into an oral
subcontract with Associated in the amount of $352,500.00, for the interior finishing,
restoration of areas disturbed by the electrical construction, and painting. Heller's bid and
contract price to DCPS incorporated Associated's bid and subcontract price to Heller. (J.S.


   LlBecause the amount of this is appeal is less than $50,000.00, this case has been decided pursuant to D.C.
Code ยง 1-1189.4(c), and Board Rule 216, 36 OCR 2709, for Optional Accelerated Procedures. By joint motion
of September 13, 1993, the parties requested to cancel the hearing set for this matter and instead requested
a decision on the record, which motion was granted by Board Order of September 14, 1993.

4).11 Associated entered into a written painting subcontract with Ballard on January 7,
1993, in the amount of $69,700.00. (J.A.F 16).1/ Associated's bid and subcontract price to
Heller incorporated Ballard's bid and subcontract price for the painting. (J.S. 5). Heller's
subcontract with Associated and Associated's agreement with Ballard were not submitted
for agency approval, and were not approved pursuant to the general terms and conditions
of the contract. (J.S. 6).

              3.    Painting requirements are set forth in the specifications, at section
09900 (J.A.F. 3), and in the contract drawings. Subsection 09900.1.1 provides in part as
follows:

                                                   ***
                B.       Paint exposed surfaces whether or not colors are designated in
                         'schedules', except where a surface or material is indicated not
                         to be painted or is to remain natural. Where an item or surface
                         is not mentioned, paint the same as similar adjacent materials
                         or surfaces. If color or finish is not designated, the Architect
                         will select from standard colors or finishes available.

Subsection 09900.1.2 provides in part as follows:

                A.       Product Data: Submit manufacturer's technical information,
                         label analysis, and application instructions for each paint
                         material proposed for use.

                K.       Application: Apply paint in accordance with the manufacturer's
                         directions. Use applicators and techniques best suited for
                         substrate and type of material being applied ....

                         1.      Paint colors, surface treatments, and finishes are
                                 indicated in 'schedules.'

                         2.      Provide finish coats that are compatible with primers
                                 used.

                         3.      The number of coats and film thickness required is the
                                 same regardless of application method. Do not apply

                            between applications where required to produce a
                            smooth, even surface.

                     4.     Apply additional coats when undercoats or other
                            conditions show through final coat, until paint film is of
                            uniform finish, color, and appearance ....

              4.     There are two sets of contract drawings affecting the painting, one that
was issued with the original IFB (J.A.F. 1), and a second set that was issued with Addendum
No.3 to the IFB. (Id.)

              5.     The original drawings for both schools provided floor plans depicting
the rooms in each building, at sheets CIE-6 and 7 (River Terrace) and C2E-8 and 10
(Noyes). The drawings include a "Room Finish Schedule" that provides information
concerning the work to be performed in the rooms, including demolition, patching, plastering
and painting. (J.S. 10).

                      The original drawings also set forth "Demolition Notes," "Finish Notes"
and "General Notes." The Room Finish Schedules include columns for each category of
notes, and indicate in the columns which notes apply to which rooms. (J.S. 11).

            6.     The "General Notes" column on the original drawings indicates that
General Note D applies to certain of the rooms in the two schools. General Note D states
as follows:

                     Finish all new work as required to match adjoining or existing.
                     (A.F. 4, CIE-6).

               7.     On May 22, 1992, the Agency issued-Addendum No.3 (J.A.F. 2), which
includes 23 pages of notes and sketches, including deletions, revisions, and additions to the
specifications, drawings, and general conditions. Addendum No.3 also includes several
sheets of drawings (J.A.F. 1).

               8.     Addendum No.3 does not specifically refer to or revise the painting
specifications. Pages 5 and 6 of the 23 pages list certain deletions and changes to drawings
CIE-6 and 7. Page 15 and 16 of the 23 pages list certain deletions and changes to drawings
C2E-8 and 10. The 23 pages of Addendum 3 notes and sketches do not reference that there
are any deletions or changes to the Room Finish Schedules or General Notes shown on the
original drawings. (J.S. 14).

              9.    Included in the drawings issued with Addendum No.3 are drawing
CIE-14 and 16 (River Terrace), and C2E-17 and 18 (Noyes). Drawings CIE-14 and C2E-17
are identified as "Finish Schedule," which provide information concerning painting in
columns for "Room No.," "Room Name," "Floor," "Base," "Walls," "Column" and "Remarks."
(J.A.F. 18).

to the Room Finish Schedules or General Notes shown on the original drawings. (l.S. 16).
Drawings CIE-16 and C2E-18 set forth "Supplemental Finish Schedule and General Notes."
Supplemental Notes 3 and 12 state as fol1ows:

              3.     Contractor shal1 paint walls in corridors, offices, stairwel1s,
                     classrooms, lunchrooms, cafeterias, assembly areas and toilet
                     rooms as indicated in the finish schedule ....

              12.    Contractor shall provide manufacturer's standard color selection
                     to be reviewed in the field. Colors will be selected by the
                     architect. Contractor shall coordinate more than one color per
                     wall where painted wainscots exist. (A.F. 1).

              11.    The prime contract contains the standard Changes clause, Article 3,
which states that the Contracting Officer:

             ... may at any time ... by written order ... make any change in the work
             within the general scope of the Contract, including but not limited to
             changes ... in the Contract Drawings and specifications .... If any
             change under this Article causes an increase ... in the Contractor's cost
             of ... the performance of any part of the work under this Contract,
             whether or not changed by any order, an equitable adjustment shall be
             made and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly ....
             (A.F. B).

               12.    On or about October 31, 1992, Heller forwarded to the Contracting
Officer a submittal, from Ballard, for agency approval (l.A.F. 14). The submittal included
a "color deck" of standard colors from the Duron Paint Company, together with an October
23, 1992 letter from Ballard to Associated (Id.) that states:

              As per the note on the drawings [supplemental note 12, on sheets
              CIE-16, C2E-18], enclosed is a Duron color deck for the Owner's use
              and/or selection. However, it should be noted that since we only
              figured to prime new plaster patches and apply one finish coat to
              match existing, color selections must closely approximate those existing
              in order to adequately cover in one coat.

               13.   On or about October 31, 1992, the Contracting Officer sent Heller's
transmittal, the Duron Color Deck and Bal1ard's October 23, 1992 letter, to DCPS' technical
department, the Office of Capital Improvements and Construction Services, for input. (l.S.
18). No response thereto was received.

              14.    On or about February 2,1993, DCPS issued revisions to the Addendum
3 drawings (drawing sheets CIE-14 and C2E-17) (l.A.F. 18). The revised drawings list two
colors for River Terrace walls -- Duron's "Yuma Yel1ow" and "Cream Apricot" -- and four
                                                                                                [5465]

colors for Noyes walls -- "Yuma Yellow," "Still Water Blue," "Mint Tone Green," and "Big
Sur." The revised drawings also add a "Color" column to the finish schedules, under the
"Room Name" heading, which indicates with which of the colors the rooms are to be
painted. (Id.)

              15.     By letter to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative dated
February 12, 1993 (J.A.F. 19), Heller forwarded a February 9, 1993 letter from Ballard (Id.)
in which Ballard stated that the "color selected for the walls will not cover the existing colors
in a one coat application, " and contended that the colors were a change to the contract
painting requirements.

              16.    By letter to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative dated
February 24, 1993 (J.A.F. 20), Heller forwarded a February 12, 1993 letter from Ballard (Id.)
requesting a Contracting Officer's decision on the dispute over the finish paint color.

              17.     By letter dated March 24, 1993 (J.A.F. 22), the Contracting Officer
issued her decision denying that the color selection set forth on the February 2, 1993
drawings was a change, and directing Heller to proceed in accordance with the color
selection. Heller and Ballard proceeded in accordance with the Contracting Officer's March
24, 1993 directive, and the painting is virtual1y complete. (J.S. 22).

               lK     By letter of April 7, 1993 (J.A.F. 24), Heller appealed the Contracting
Officer's decision to the Superintendent on behalf of Ballard. By letter of April 16, 1993,
the Superintendent upheld the Contracting Officer's decision, and the instant appeal ensued.
(A.F. A).

                               POSITION OF THE PARTIES

Appellant

        Appellant takes the position that Heller informed DCPS, before the contract was
signed, of Ballard's interpretation that the new wall finish paint colors were to match the
existing paint colors and would therefore only require one coat of paint. Appellant urges
that when DCPS entered into the contract without expressing a contrary view, it was thereby
bound by Ballard's interpretation, Perry & Wallis, Inc. v. United States, 427 F. 2d 722, 728,
192 Ct. Cl. 310 (Ct. Cl. 1970); Creswell v. United States, 427 F. 2d 722, 725, 146 Ct. Cl. 119
(Ct. Cl. 1959).

       Next, Appellant argues that its interpretation of the contract documents must govern
because its interpretation gives force and effect to all of the contract provisions. Rastall v.
CSX Transportation, Inc., 574 A. 2d 271, 278 (D.C. App. 1990). Finally, Appellant argues
that even if DCPS' interpretation is also reasonable, Heller's interpretation should govern
because DCPS furnished the contract documents. Intercounty Construction Corp. v. District
of Columbia, 443 A. 2d 29, 32 (D.C. App. 1982).
                                                                                                       [5466]

DCPS

        DCPS points out that Appellant has cited case law concerning contract principles for
latent ambiguities in contract language. However, where, as here, there is no ambiguity, the
wording of the contract controls and resort cannot be had to extraneous circumstances or
subjective interpretations. Duhame v. United States, 119 F. Supp. 192, 195, 127 Ct. Cl. 679,
683 (1954). DCPS further argues that Appellant's interpretation fails to give effect to the
contract language which stated that the architect was to select the paint color. (See F.F.
10).~ With regard to the contract principle that ambiguities are to be construed against
the drafter, DCPS argues that because there is no ambiguity, the principle is inapplicable.


                                               DECISION

       We can find no merit in Appellant's position.

       To support its argument that only one coat of paint was required by the contract
documents, Appellant relies on General Note D which states, "Finish all new work as
required to match adjoining or existing." (See F.F. 6). However the General Notes do not
address painting specifically on drawing C1E-6.~/ Painting is addressed in the Finish
Notes)' We do not agree that General Note D limits DCPS to use paint which matches


  ,ilFindings of Fact are hereinafter referred to as (F.F._).

  ~The General Notes provide:

       General Notes:

       A       All walls and ceilings should be restored to match original condition prior
               to commencement of work.

       B.      For mounting heights of new fixtures see specifications.

       C.      All cutting and patching shall be included for completion of this work.
               Materials shall match adjoining.

       D.      Finish all new work as required to match adjoining or existing.

                                                                                            (AF. D., CIE-6)

  Z'The Finish Notes provide:

       Finish Notes:

       lA      All newly patched and plastered walls are to receive paint finish to match
               adjacent walls.

       2A      New wall tiles should match existing wall tiles.
                                                                                               (continued ... )
                                                                                                          [5467]

existing colors. Instead, the plain language of the contract requires the contractor to "paint
walls in corridors, offices, stairwells, classrooms, lunchrooms, cafeterias, assembly areas and
toilet rooms as indicated in the finish schedule .... " (emphasis added). (F.F. 10). Finish
schedules were in fact provided by DCPS which set forth information for painting (F.F. 9),
including the colors to be used for River Terrace and Noyes Schools. (F.F. 14). Further,
the plain language of the contract states, "Colors will be selected by the architect." (F.F. 10).
Appellant also can point to no contract language which states that only one coat of paint is
necessary. To the contrary, the plain language of the contract states, t'[a]pply additional
coats when undercoats or other conditions show through final coat, until paint film is of
uniform finish, color and appearance." (F.F. 3).

       We conclude therefore, that there is no ambiguity in the contract language with
respect to paint colors, or number of coats of paint required. Instead, Appellant has
advanced an unsupported position with respect to contract interpretation because the
painting subcontractor Ballard apparently based the bid on its erroneous assumption that
only one coat of paint was necessary. (See l. Ballard Affidavit, l.A.F. 33). As DCPS has
correctly pointed out, a contract is not rendered ambiguous by the mere fact that the parties
disagree as to its meaning, when the disagreement is not based on reasonable uncertainty
of the meaning of the language used. Perry & Wallis, Inc., 192 Ct. Cl. at 315; Bishop
Engineering Co. v. United States, 180 Ct. Cl. 411, 416 (1967). Where a contract is not
ambiguous, the wording of the contract controls its meaning and resort cannot be had to
extraneous circumstances or subjective interpretations to determine such meaning. Perry &
Wallis, Inc., 192 Ct. Cl. at 315; Duhame, 127 Ct. Cl. at 683.

        Further we are not persuaded by Appellant that only its interpretation of the contract
gives force and effect to all of the provisions of the contract. To the contrary, Appellant'S
interpretation misconstrues or ignores the finish schedules for painting, the paint color
selected by DCPS, the numbers of coats of paint required, and the authority of the architect
to select the paint colors. (See P.P. 3, 5, 9, 10). With respect to the contract provision
which states that the architect shall select the colors (F.F. 10), Appellant asserts that "the
reason for having the architect make the selection is that there are many gradations of
similar colors from which to choose, and the architect is responsible for decisions on
aesthetics." (Appellant's Brief, p. 20). However, there are no contract provisions which limit
the architect to selecting only gradations of similar colors. Instead, the architect is limited
only by Subsection 00900.1.1B, which provides, "If color or finish is not designated, the
Architect will select from standard colors or finishes available." (F.P. 3). However, the
colors for both River Terrace and Noyes were selected and indicated in the contract
