                                          OPINION

        W.M. Schlosser Company, Inc. ("Schlosser"), the only bidder under Invitation No. 9469-
94-AI-23-HC, protests the District of Columbia's determination that Schlosser's bid was
nonresponsive because of a defective bid guarantee. Schlosser also challenges the District's
decision to cancel the IFB and to reissue the solicitation under Invitation No. 5164-95-Al-23-
DM. The District asserts that the contracting officer properly determined that Schlosser's bid
guarantee was defective and that the contracting officer reasonably determined that bid
cancellation and resolicitation were warranted. We sustain the protest.

                                            FACTS

        On October 3, 1994, the Department of Public and Assisted Housing ("DPAH") issued
Invitation for Bids ("IFB") No. 9469-94-AI-23-HC in the open market to modernize the Eastgate
Gardens apartments. (Agency Report ("AR") Exhibit 1). DPAH issued the IFB to eight
vendors. On November 7, 1994, protester submitted the only bid received by DPAH. (AR
Exhibit 2). The instructions to bidders are set forth in a form furnished by the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"). (AR Exhibit 1). Paragraph 9 of the instructions
deals with bid guarantees and provides in pertinent part:

       All bids must be accompanied by a negotiable bid guarantee which shall not be
       less than five percent (5 %) of the amount of the bid. . . . The bid guarantee may
       be . . . a bid bond secured by a surety company . . .. Failure to submit a bid
       guarantee with the bid shall result in the rejection of the bid. . .. "

The cover sheet for Schlosser's bid is a DPAH standard form entitled "Bid Form Construction
Contract". (AR Exhibit 2, Attachment B). One line on the Bid Form reads: "Enclosed is bid
guaranty consisting of 5% of the total amount bid. Bid Bond Certified'Check' Other" (Jd.).
The words "Bid Bond" are circled. The form is executed by Schlosser's president. The bid also
contains a 2-page form entitled "Bid Bond (Construction)" which is another standard DPAH
[6060]

         form. (Schlosser Reply, Exhibit A). The bid bond form identifies the IFB, the bidder, the
         surety, and is executed by Schlosser and the surety. The following blocks (as completed by
         Schlosser) also appear on the bond:

         Although Schlosser entered the requested corporate and bid identification information in the top
         two and bottom blocks, neither Schlosser nor the surety entered any amounts or made any
         markings on the other blocks relating to the amount of the bid bond. Printed portions of the
         bond below these blocks contain, inter alia, the following language:

                [T]he principal and Surety(ies) hereto, are firmly bound to the District of
                Columbia Government ... in the above penal sum for the payment of which we
                bind ourselves . . . .

         Five instructions appear on page 2 of the bid bond but none of them give any directions on
         filling out the blocks reprinted above.

                 On November 18, 1994, the contracting officer executed a Determination and Findings
         for Cancellation which indicated that because the bid bond of Schlosser did not contain a face
         value the bid was rejected as nonresponsive. (AR Exhibit 3). The rejection of the bid and
         cancellation of the IFB were approved by the Director of the Department of Administrative
         Services ("DAS") on November 21, 1994. (Id.). DPAH resolicited the requirements by
         reissuing the IFB (under Invitation No. 5164-AI-23-DM) on November 21, 1994. Bid opening
         was scheduled for January 13, 1995.

                 On December 7, 1994, Schlosser filed its protest, alleging that its bid was responsive
         because the bid bond was for the penal sum of five percent of the bid as required by the IFB.
         Schlosser requested that it receive contract award under the original IFB and that the new IFB
         be cancelled. On December 20, 1994, the District advised the Board that bid opening for the
         resolicitation was to be extended to January 27, 1995. Pursuant to a Board order of December
         20, the District filed an agency report on January 6, 1995, and the protester filed a reply on
         January 17, 1995.
                                                                                              [6061]



                                               -3-               W.M. Schlosser Co .• CAB No. P-425


        In its agency report, the District argues that the bid bond is clearly defective because:
(1) no penal sum is identified in the appropriate box; (2) no "Amount Not To Exceed" is listed
in the appropriate boxes; and (3) the "5% of Bid" box is not checked off. Noting GNIJ
Enterprises, Inc., CAB No. P-1l8, Sept. 28, 1990,38 D.C. Reg. 3125, where we held that, in
accord with 27 DCMR § 2702.2, it was improper for a contracting officer to reject the bid of
the sole bidder where the only basis for rejecting the bid was the bidder's failure to furnish a
bid bond, the District contends that the contracting officer had a reasonable basis for rejecting
Schlosser's bid because HUD's "Procurement Handbook for Public Housing Agency's (PHAs)
and Indian Housing Authorities (lHAs) , " Handbook 7460.8 Rev-l (Jan. 1993), requires rejection
of a bid where a bid bond is defective.

        In its January 17 reply to the agency report, Schlosser urges that the bid bond on its face
sets forth the penal sum as "5% of Bid" and there was no requirement for checking off the box
containing that notation. Schlosser also points to the bid form's indication of a bid guarantee
consisting of "five percent of the total amount bid." Schlosser has attached an affidavit from
the bonding agent who prepared and signed the bond on behalf of the surety stating that her
understanding was that the bond was in the amount of five percent of the bid. Schlosser
contends that 27 DCMR § 2702.2 and our ruling in GNIJ control the outcome here because the
provision from the HUD Procurement Handbook relied upon by the District requires a bid
guarantee of five percent "unless otherwise required by state or local laws or regulations."

                                         DISCUSSION

       The Board has jurisdiction over this protest pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1189.3 (1992).

        The Procurement Practices Act generally requires bid security (e.g., a bid bond) for all
competitive sealed bids and competitive sealed proposals for construction contracts when the
price is estimated by the District to exceed $100,000. D.C. Code § 1-1185.2(a)(l); 27 DCMR
§ 2701.2. The procurement statute and regulations also specify that a bid bond shall be in an
amount equal to at least five percent of the amount of the bid or price proposal. D.C. Code §
1-1185 .2(b); 27 DCMR § 2701.4. The statute provides that if an invitation requires a bid bond,
and a bidder does not comply -- i.e., by failing to submit a bid bond or by submitting a defective
bid bond -- then the bid must be rejected unless, pursuant to the procurement regulations, it is
determined that the bid fails to comply in a non substantial manner with the security
requirements. D.C. Code § 1-1185.2(c). Certain enumerated exceptions to the general
mandatory requirement for bid security are contained in 27 DCMR § 2702. Under 27 DCMR
§ 2702.2, if a bidder fails to comply with the bid security requirements, but is the only one who
submitted a bid, the bid may be accepted and the contracting officer shall require the furnishing
of the bid security before the contract is signed.· In GNIJ, we held that it was improper for
the contracting officer to reject a bid where there was only one bidder and where the sole basis
for rejection was the bidder's failure to provide a bid bond. We stated that there had to be some
other reasonable basis for rejection. 38 D.C. Reg. at 3127-28.


• The District's exceptions to the bid security requirements, such as 27 DCMR §2702.2, have
their counterparts in the Federal Acquisition Regulation. See, e.g., 48 C.F.R. § 28.101-4(c)(l).

                                                        -4-                W.M. Schlosser Co., CAB No. P-425


                 Citing HUD's Procurement Handbook, the District contends that HUD's procurement
         policy set forth in Chapter 4 of the Handbook requires all bidders to submit a bid bond in the
         penal sum of five percent and that a failure to do so requires rejection of the bid. 2 (AR at 5;
         AR Exhibit 4). According to the District, this procurement policy provides the "reasonable
         basis" for rejection required by GNlJ. We do not agree. Chapter 4 of HUD's Procurement
         Handbook expressly provides that a number of its requirements are not to override state or local
         law. The bid guarantee requirement is one such requirement. For construction contracts
         exceeding $100,000, paragraph 4-16.E.1.a states: "24 CFR 85.36 provides that contractors shall
         be required to submit the following, unless otherwise required by State or local laws or
         regulations: (1) a bid guaranty from each bidder equivalent to 5 % of the bid price .... " (AR
         Exhibit 4, at page 4-12 (emphasis added». In addition, the introduction to Paragraph 4-16 of
         the Handbook states. "The required bond or guaranty is described in the sample procurement
         policy statement in Appendices 1, 2 and 3 based on HUD regulations." Appendix 1, entitled
         "Sample Statement of Procurement Policy for Public Housing Agencies," like Paragraph 4-
         16.E.1.a of the Handbook, requires in Section III.C.5 that bidders submit a bid guarantee equal
         to five percent of the bid price "unless otherwise required by State or local laws or regulations. "
         (Protester's Reply, Exhibit E). There can be no question that District procurement law makes
         an exception to the requirement for bid security at the time of bid where only one bidder submits
         a bid. The Federal Acquisition Regulation contains the same exception to bid security
         requirements where there is only one bidder, see 48 C.F.R. § 28.101-4(c)(l), and the
         Comptroller General of the United States has even ruled that a local housing agency's decision
         to waive bid security requirements in connection with a HUD-funded project was fully in accord
         with federal law and regulation. Ed Davis Construction, Inc., B-216353, Feb. 22, 1985,85-1
         CPD 1226.



         2   Paragraph 4-16 of HUD' s Procurement Handbook, at page 4-11, provides in relevant part:

                 A.     Bid guarantee.

                        1.     A bid guarantee or bid bond is submitted by the
                               bidders with their bids and assures that, if awarded
                               the contract, the bidder will accept and perform the
                               contract and not attempt to withdraw or otherwise
                               disavow the contract and will execute such
                               contractual documents as may be required within
                               the time specified . . . .

                        2.     If the contractor does attempt to renege on the
                               contract, the surety for the bond is required to step
                               in and take over performance of the contract, or the
                               check tendered may be cashed. . .. If the bid
                               guarantee is not submitted with the bid, the
                               [housing agency] shall reject the bid . . . .
                                                                                               [6063]

       Accordingly, the contracting officer should not have determined Schlosser's bid to be
nonresponsive even if the bid bond was defective. 3

        The protest is sustained. The District shall award the contract under the original
invitation to Schlosser assuming it is found to be responsible. The reissued solicitation,
Invitation No. 5164-AI-23-DM, shall be cancelled.·

       SO ORDERED.

3 With regard to the issue of whether Schlosser's bid bond is defective, we are satisfied from
the record that the bid bond sets forth a penal sum of five percent of the bid. No specific dollar
amounts are set forth in the,"Penal Sum of Bond" block or t.he "Amount Not To Exceed" block.
We agree with the protester that the "5% of Bid" block indicates a bond in the required amount
of five percent of the bid. The lack of a check mark or other indication in the "5% of Bid"
block does not lead us to a contrary conclusion. The bid instructions neither suggested nor
required such a marking. In the absence of a specified penal sum or NTE amount which
contradicts the indication of "5 % of Bid", this particular bid bond form identifies a bid security
amount of five percent of the bid. Because we are of the view that the surety here would be
held liable for five percent of the bid (if the bidder defaulted), the bid bond is not defective.

• On January 26, 1995, the clerk orally advised the parties of the Board's decision to sustain
the protest.
