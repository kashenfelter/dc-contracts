                                   OPINION DENYING THE PROTEST OF GRAN TURK
                                                 Filing ID 44639736

        In this matter, third-ranked bidder GranTurk Equipment Co., Inc. (protester or GranTurk)
protests the Department of Public Works’ (District) award of a contract for the acquisition of two
refuse trucks to low bidder Waste Equipment Sales and Service, Inc. (Waste or Intervenor). The
protester also challenges the responsiveness of the second ranked bidder, Maryland Industrial
Trucks (M.I.T.). M.I.T. has neither protested the award to Waste, nor intervened in this matter.

        After carefully reviewing the entire record herein, we dismiss GranTurk’s protest because
it has not demonstrated that it would be next in line for award were the protest to be sustained.
The second ranked bid submitted by M.I.T. would be next in line for award if the protest were
sustained. Gran Turk’s contention that M.I.T.’s bid is non-responsive because its descriptive
literature fails to conform to two bid specifications is without merit. Under Section L.20.2 of the
solicitation herein, the contracting officer had discretion to accept bids whose descriptive
literature failed to conform to solicitation specifications. Accordingly, even if the descriptive
literature submitted with M.I.T.’s bid failed to conform to solicitation specifications, M.I.T.’s bid
was properly determined responsive. Under these circumstances, the protester is not next in line
for award, and lacks standing to protest the award to Waste.

                                                               BACKGROUND

        On January 6, 2011, the District issued IFB No. DCKT-2011-B-0034 (IFB) for the
acquisition of seven refuse trucks.1 The protest herein centers solely on the District’s award to
Waste of a single component of the IFB: CLIN#1 for two 16 cubic-yard high compaction rear
loader refuse trucks. (AR, Ex. 2.)

        With respect to CLIN#1 and the issues material to the instant protest, the IFB included
three specifications (at Section C) and two instructions (at Section L) of singular import:

              C.2.2.25.3                    Compaction force: minimum 89,000 pounds. Must be high compaction.

  The District procured a total of two 16 cubic‐yard high compaction rear loader refuse trucks,  one 6 cubic‐yard 
rear loader refuse packer, and four 8 cubic‐yard rear loader packers. (AR, Ex. 2.) The IFB provided each vehicle type 
with its own Contract Line Item Number (CLIN), and also stated the District’s intention to award a firm fixed‐price 
contract to a single contractor for each CLIN.   
                                                                     2
                                                                                                       Granturk, Inc.
                                                                                                     CAB No. P-0884
                                            (State compaction force to be provided): _____________

              C.2.2.25.5                    Body sides shall be minimum 11 gauge to 1/8 inch AR450 high tensile
                                            sheet which has tensile strength of over 200,000 PSI. Curved shell design
                                            with ¼” wrap around reinforcement top and bottom. The body floor shall
                                            be ¼” minimum.2

              C.2.2.26.4                    Hopper: minimum 3/8 inch 100,000 PSI steel one-piece (no liners).

              L.20.1 Descriptive literature must be furnished as a part of a bid and must be received
              before the time set for opening bids. The literature furnished must be identified to show
              the items in the bid to which it pertains. The descriptive literature is required to establish,
              for the purpose of bid evaluation and award, details of the products the bidder proposes to
              furnish as to design, material, quality, construction, and performance characteristics.

              L.20.2 Failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the
              specifications and other requirements of this invitation for bids may require rejection of
              the bid. Failure to furnish the descriptive literature by the time and date set for receipt of
              bids will require rejection of the bid, except that if the materials are transmitted by mail
              and received late, it may be considered under the provision for considering late bids, as
              set forth elsewhere in this invitation for bids. The Contracting Officer may waive the
              requirement for furnishing descriptive literature if either of the following occurs:

                             A. Bidder states in the bid that the product being offered is the same as a product
                             previously or currently being furnished to the District; or
                             B. The CO, on advice of technical personnel determines that the product offered
                             by the bidder complies with the specification requirements of the current
                             invitation for bids. (emphasis added.)

        (AR, Ex. 2a.) On February 3, 2011, the District received six timely bids in response to
CLIN#1 (including two no-bids). (Protest at 5; AR, Ex. 1.) The bids were ranked as follows per
the bid tabulation sheet:

                                                          Bidder                    Bid Amount
                                           1. Mid-Atlantic Waste Systems            $376,666.00

                                           2. Waste Equipment Sales and Service     $378,060.00

                                           3. Maryland Industrial Trucks            $381,340.00

                                           4. GranTurk Equipment Co., Inc.          $393,232.00

  Section C.2.2.25.5 was amended by the District on January 26, 2011, to accept a minimum of 80,000 psi. (AR, Ex. 
3, Amendments to the Solicitation.) The amendment does not impact the Board’s analysis or conclusions.

                                                                                                   Granturk, Inc.
                                                                                                 CAB No. P-0884
        The contracting officer’s technical representative concluded its bid review on February 8,
2011; noting that Mid-Atlantic Waste Systems’ bid was non-responsive3, but concluding that the
bids of Waste, M.I.T. and Gran Turk were responsive. (AR, Ex. 10.) Each of the three
responsive bidders submitted descriptive literature with their bids as required by Sections L.20.1
and L.20.2 of the IFB.

        On April 5, 2011, approximately five weeks after bid opening, the District’s contract
specialist (at the behest of the contracting officer) sent emails to Mid-Atlantic, Waste, M.I.T. and
Gran Turk, asking each to clarify whether their particular refuse truck met the IFB’s requirement
for 89,000 lbs. minimum compaction force.4 (AR, Exs. 9, 11.) The four bidders replied to the
referenced emails by April 6-7, 2011; with the result being that the bid rankings and
responsiveness memorandum of February 8, 2011, remained unchanged5. (AR, Ex. 9.)

        On April 27, 2011, the District awarded the contract for the two rear loader refuse trucks
to Waste. (AR, Ex. 7.) Third low bidder GranTurk filed the instant protest timely on May 11,
2011. The awardee Waste intervened on June 14, 2011.6 Second low bidder M.I.T. has neither
protested nor intervened in the instant protest. The Board conducted a hearing on July 26-27,
2011.7 The parties and Waste filed post-hearing briefs on August 30, 2011. Miscellaneous
pleadings were filed by the parties after the filing of post-hearing briefs through December 2011.

        In its protest, Gran Turk challenges both the awardee8 and the next in line bidder, M.I.T.
(Protest at 9, 11, 12-14, 18-19.) With respect to the protester’s challenge to M.I.T., Gran Turk
contends generally that the District erred in determining M.I.T.’s bid responsive to two
specifications of the IFB. Very specifically, Gran Turk contends that M.I.T.’s descriptive
literature for the curved shell design specification (C.2.2.25.5) does not “demonstrate that
                                                            
3
   Mid‐Atlantic’s bid offering of “69,000 lbs psi” compaction force was found unacceptable as to specification 
C.2.2.25.3, and its “minimum 4 to 4.5 inches of bore packing carrier or slide cylinder” was found unacceptable as to 
specification C.2.27.13. (AR, Ex. 10.)  
4
   The District’s emails also sought clarification as to whether each bidder’s equipment met minimum requirements 
for cubic yard space (C.2.2.25.2), refuse capacity (C.2.2.25.4), body thickness (C.2.2.25.5), and hydraulic system 
operating pressure (C.2.2.27.3). (AR, Ex. 9.)  
5
   Mid Atlantic’s earlier non‐responsiveness determination did not change, and the bids of Waste, M.I.T., and 
GranTurk continued to be viewed as responsive by the contracting officer. (AR, Ex. 9, Greg Harrelson Email.)   
6
   Waste intervened pursuant to D.C. Mun. Reg. tit. 27, §100.2(l) (2002). 
7
   This case was originally assigned to former Administrative Judge Warren Nash, who presided over the hearing but 
retired before a decision was issued.  Thereafter, the case was reassigned to Chief Judge Loud.     
8
   With respect to the awardee, the protester contends that (1) Waste’s “descriptive literature” noted that its 
equipment produced “79,500 pounds of compaction force, not the 89,000 pounds of compaction force required 
by” the specifications, (2) Waste’s bid “did not state that its” equipment could meet the curved body shell design 
specification and the descriptive literature submitted therewith also failed to demonstrate such compliance, and 
(3) Waste’s bid did not meet the specification requirement for a 3/8 inch hopper floor based on “descriptive 
literature” that described Waste’s rear loader as providing “3/8 inch AR200” instead of the required “3/8 inch 
100,000 PSI steel”. (Gran Turk Protest at 12‐14.)  Subsequent to filing its protest, Gran Turk asserted an additional 
ground for challenging the award to Waste, namely that the District violated procurement law by requesting and 
considering additional information from bidders subsequent to bid opening. (Gran Turk Comments To AR at 13‐17; 
Gran Turk Post Hr’g Br. 13‐19.)  The additional allegation focuses almost exclusively, however, on the District’s 
request for and consideration of additional information from Waste. Id.

                                                                                                      Granturk, Inc.
                                                                                                    CAB No. P-0884
M.I.T.’s offering will comply with this specification”. (Gran Turk Post-Hr’g Br. 5, 46.) Gran
Turk also contends that M.I.T.’s descriptive literature differed from specification C.2.2.26.4 by
stating that “the tailgate hopper floor [would] be ¼ inch” rather than the specification’s required
3/8 inch thickness. (Gran Turk Post-Hr’g Br. 5-6; GranTurk Comments To AR, Ex. A, Decl. of
Edward A. Antoniewicz.)

        Finally, Gran Turk contends as to both specifications (C.2.2.25.5 and C.2.2.26.4) that
M.I.T.’s failure to “state that [it] would comply with [the specifications] rendered its bid non-
responsive in light of the fact that “M.I.T. stated ‘yes’ … it would comply with many of the other
specifications in Section C of the IFB”. 9 (Gran Turk Post Hr’g Br. 5, 50-51.)

                                                               DISCUSSION

              We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code §2-360.03(a)(1).

       The threshold question presented is whether the protester has standing to challenge the
award to Waste. As noted herein, Gran Turk is not next in line for award. (AR, Ex. 1). Gran Turk
had the highest priced of three responsive bids. Gran Turk contends, however, that it has
standing because its pleadings challenge both the awardee and the next in line (M.I.T.). (Gran
Turk Post Hr’g Br. 10-11.)

        A protester has standing for purposes of jurisdiction if it has some direct economic
interest in the procurement. Micro Computer Co., Inc., CAB No. P-226, 40 D.C. Reg. 4388 (May
12, 1992). However, where there is “an intermediate party who has a greater interest in the
procurement than the protester, the protester’s interest will be, and is, considered too remote to
qualify as an aggrieved or interested party”. Protest of MTI-RECYC, CAB No. P-287, 40 D.C.
Reg. 4554 (Oct. 1, 1992). The Board will not consider protests by offerors who are not next in
line for award if the protest is sustained. St. John’s Community Services, CAB No. P-555, 46
D.C. Reg. 7695 (Mar. 23, 1999); C.P.F. Corporation, CAB No. P-521, 45 D.C. Reg. 8697 (Jan.
12, 1998).

        We conclude that the protester has failed to demonstrate that it is next in line for award if
the protest were to be sustained. M.I.T. is a clear intermediary bidder in this matter whose bid
ranked second overall to the awardee Waste. The bid tabulation sheet ranks M.I.T. as the second
low responsive bidder (AR, Ex. 2), the contracting officer determined M.I.T. as the second low
responsive bid (AR, Exs. 6, 10), and the contracting officer testified that M.I.T. would be next in
line for award if the protest against Waste were to be sustained (Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 147:5-20, July
27, 2011.)

   Initially, Gran Turk also contended that M.I.T.’s descriptive literature failed to conform to specification C.2.2.25.3 
regarding compaction force. (Protest at 18‐19.) Gran Turk has not included the latter protest grounds in its post‐
hearing brief materials. The Board therefore treats the latter argument as abandoned by Gran Turk. It is immaterial 
to the Board’s analysis and conclusions, however, whether Gran Turk challenges M.I.T.’s descriptive literature as to 
Section C.2.2.25.3 (compaction force).     
 
                                                               5
                                                                                                 Granturk, Inc.
                                                                                               CAB No. P-0884
        To determine whether Gran Turk is next in line for award, this board must first address
whether Gran Turk’s challenge to the second low bidder herein (M.I.T.) has merit. Gran Turk
contends that M.I.T.’s bid was non-responsive because its descriptive literature failed to
conform to sections C.2.2.25.5 and C.2.2.26.4. It is important to note that Gran Turk’s basis for
challenging M.I.T.’s second place ranking is the (purported) failure of its descriptive literature to
comply with certain IFB specifications10. (Gran Turk Post Hr’g Br. 20-27.) Gran Turk’s protest
rests entirely on its interpretation that section L.20 of the IFB requires descriptive literature to
conform to IFB specifications. (Gran Turk Post Hr’g Br. 22, 50-51.)

       Our review of section L.20 of the IFB does not support Gran Turk’s contention. In
pertinent part, Section L provides:

              L.20.1 Descriptive literature must be furnished as a part of a bid and must be received
              before the time set for opening bids. The literature furnished must be identified to show
              the items in the bid to which it pertains. The descriptive literature is required to establish,
              for the purpose of bid evaluation and award, details of the products the bidder proposes to
              furnish as to design, material, quality, construction, and performance characteristics.

              L.20.2 Failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the
              specifications and other requirements of this invitation for bids may require rejection of
              the bid. Failure to furnish the descriptive literature by the time and date set for receipt of
              bids will require rejection of the bid, except that if the materials are transmitted by mail
              and received late, it may be considered under the provision for considering late bids, as
              set forth elsewhere in this invitation for bids. The Contracting Officer may waive the
              requirement for furnishing descriptive literature if either of the following occurs:

                             A. Bidder states in the bid that the product being offered is the same as a product
                             previously or currently being furnished to the District; or
                             B. The CO, on advice of technical personnel determines that the product offered
                             by the bidder complies with the specification requirements of the current
                             invitation for bids. (emphasis added.)

              (AR, Ex. 2a.)

        The general rule is that where a contract is not ambiguous, the wording of the contract
controls its meaning and resort cannot be had to extraneous circumstances or subjective
interpretations to determine such meaning. Appeal of Heller Elec. Co., Inc., CAB No. D-939, 41
D.C. Reg. 3717, 3723 (Nov. 17, 1993)(citations omitted). The same maxim applies to
interpretation of a solicitation. Allied Technology Group, Inc. v. U.S., 39 Fed. Cl. 125, 144 (Cl.
Ct. 1997); Blake Constr. Co. v. U.S., 202 Ct. Cl. 794, 798 (1973).

        In our view, the plain language of Section L.20.2 makes it very clear that a bid whose
descriptive literature does not conform to IFB specifications “may” be accepted. The relevant
section L.20.2 expressly states that “[f]ailure of descriptive literature to show that the product
                                                            
10
  Protester states that “the only way to give meaning to Section L.20 of the IFB … is that the bid and the

offered conforms to the specifications and other requirements of this invitation for bids may
require rejection of the bid”. (Emphasis added.) In this case, it was lawful for the contracting
officer to accept M.I.T.’s bid as responsive, notwithstanding the alleged failure of its descriptive
literature to conform to specifications C.2.2.25.5 and C.2.2.26.4. Under these circumstances,
M.I.T. is next in line for award and the only bidder with standing to challenge the award to
Waste herein.

        A review of our previous decisions addressing descriptive literature finds nothing
inconsistent with our conclusion that Section L.20.2 herein grants the contracting officer
discretion to accept bids with non-conforming descriptive literature. In Protest of Advanced
Medical Systems Inc., CAB No. P-202, 39 D.C. Reg. 4516 (April 1, 1992), the Board ruled that
the protester’s bid was properly rejected as non-responsive because its descriptive literature
failed to establish that its fetal monitor met the specification requirement for an autocorrelation
feature. In Protest of Lewis Systems, CAB No. P-252, 38 D.C. Reg. 3242 (April 11, 1991), the
Board ruled that the protester’s bid was properly rejected as non-responsive because its
descriptive literature failed to establish that its curbside recycling containers met the
specification requirement for a minimum drainage capacity of 10 ounces.
        In each of the above mentioned cases, however, the District’s contracting officer was
required by the terms of the solicitation to reject bids whose descriptive literature failed to
conform to contract specifications. The descriptive literature clauses in Advanced Medical
Systems, supra, and Lewis Systems, supra, are identical and read as follows: “[f]ailure of
descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the specifications and other
requirements of this invitation for bids will require rejection of the bid” (emphasis added). (AR,
IFB No. 081-9-65-CW, ¶27, §B, Advanced Medical Systems, supra; AR, Ex. C Special
Conditions, ¶ 9, §B, Lewis Systems, supra.) Therefore, the Board’s previous cases are
distinguished from the instant matter in that Section L.20.2 herein expressly gives the contracting
officer discretion to accept a bid with non-conforming descriptive literature.11
        Further, we have reviewed the federal government contract cases cited by the protester
regarding descriptive literature clauses. FFR-Bauelement-Bausanierung GmbH, Comp. Gen.
Dec. B-274828, 97-1 CPD ¶7; Thermal Reduction Co., Comp. Gen. Dec. B-211405, 83-2 CPD
¶180; RMTC Sys., Inc. v. Dep’t of the Army, GSBCA 12637-P, 94-2 BCA ¶26,614; Nu-Lite
Electrical Wholesalers, Inc., Comp. Gen. Dec. B-248383, 92-2 CPD ¶104; AMSCO Scientific,
Comp. Gen. Dec. B-255313, 94-1 CPD ¶112.

       These cases are inapposite to the issues presented by the present protest because Section
L.20.2 herein grants the contracting officer discretion to accept bids with non-conforming
descriptive literature. The federal cases cited by protester either involve descriptive literature
clauses that specifically require rejection of bids with non-conforming descriptive literature,

   The descriptive literature clause in Advanced Medical Systems, supra, and Lewis Systems, supra, also appears in 
Protest of Chesapeake Bus & Equipment, CAB No. P‐611, 48 D.C. Reg. 1537 (May 10, 2000). It is possible, therefore, 
that the District inserted the instant Section L.20.2 language into solicitations to clarify contracting officer’s 
discretion to accept bids with non‐conforming descriptive literature, and that the current clause is the successor to 
the District’s earlier descriptive literature clause. The record is silent, however, as to the basis for the change in 
language from the compulsive “will” to the permissive “may” as regards the District’s descriptive literature clause.

contracting officer is only authorized to accept bids whose descriptive literature “meets the
salient physical, functional, and other characteristics” specified in the solicitation, FFR-
Bauelement-Bausanierung GmbH, Comp. Gen. Dec. B-274828, 97-1 CPD; RMTC Sys., Inc. v.
Dep’t of the Army, GSBCA 12637-P, 94-2 BCA ¶26,614; or invoke rules regarding treatment of
unsolicited descriptive literature, Nu-Lite Electrical Wholesalers, Inc., Comp. Gen. Dec. B-
248383, 92-2 CPD ¶104.

         We have considered the protester’s other arguments challenging the award to Waste and
find them equally devoid of merit. The protester’s contention that the contracting officer
testified that descriptive literature must be read to make a proper responsiveness determination is
legally irrelevant. (Gran Turk Post Hr’g Br. 25-26). It is legally irrelevant because Section
L.20.2 is manifestly clear that bids with non-conforming descriptive literature can be accepted by
the contracting officer. And as we noted in Heller, supra, where contract language is
unambiguous, resort to extraneous circumstances or subjective interpretations is not permissible
for purposes of contract interpretation. Heller at 3723.

        Additionally, there is nothing in D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 27, §1507.2 (2002) that prevents a
contracting officer from accepting a bid whose descriptive literature fails to conform to IFB
specifications. (Gran Turk Post Hr’g Br. 23.) The regulation cited by the protester merely
delimits the two circumstances under which a contracting officer can require the submission of
descriptive literature with bids. Neither circumstance, however, limits the contracting officer’s
discretion to accept bids with non-conforming descriptive literature.12 In this case, the IFB
specifically conferred that authority on the contracting officer at Section L.20.2.

        Further, we disagree with the protester’s labeling of the instant descriptive literature
clause as meaningless. (Gran Turk Post Hr’g Br. 22.) To the contrary, the contracting officer
herein testified that she uses the bid as “controlling” and that the descriptive literature “is just
supplemental”. (Hr’g Tr., Gena Johnson, vol. 2, 94:19-22, July 27, 2011.) The contracting
officer’s use of descriptive literature in said manner is consistent with Section L.20.1 of the
solicitation, which notes that descriptive literature is required to provide details about the product
being offered (i.e., its design, material, quality, construction, and performance characteristics).

        Additionally, protester’s contention that M.I.T.’s bid was rendered ambiguous because it
failed to “state that [it]will comply” with specifications C.2.2.25.5 and C.2.2.26.4 “although
[M.I.T.] stated “yes” that it would comply with many of the other specifications” is without
merit. The protester has not cited any authority for the proposition that a bidder has a duty to
write the word “comply” next to each specification in its bid to demonstrate responsiveness.
Moreover, item No. 12 of M.I.T.’s signed bid states that “in compliance with the above
[including Section C], the undersigned agrees…to furnish any or all items upon which prices are
offered.” (AR, Ex. 5, M.I.T. Bid.) The bidder’s signed execution of the bid at item No. 12

determine before award that products offered meet bid specifications. D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 27, §1507.2 (2002).   
Alternatively, the regulation provides that a contracting officer can require submission of descriptive literature if

denotes acceptance of IFB terms, excluding those that the bidder has taken exception to. Cf.
Matter of: Image Contracting, B-253038, 1993 WL 316192 (bidder’s signed execution of the bid
documents represents its agreement to be bound by all sections in the Table of Contents).

        Finally, it is not altogether clear from the record whether the protester asserts standing on
the grounds that the integrity of the evaluation process was compromised by the District’s
requesting email clarifications from bidders on equipment characteristics five weeks after bid
opening. See CUP Temp., Inc. , CAB No. P-474, 44 D.C. Reg. 6841 (July 3, 1997). The initial
protest herein includes specific challenges to M.I.T. as next in line, but only on the ground that
descriptive literature made its bid non-responsive to IFB “specifications and essential
requirements”. (Gran Turk’s Protest 1,6,11,18-19, 21.) Similarly, Gran Turk’s post-hearing brief
states conclusorily that it has standing because “([it] has challenged the first and second ranked
bidders (Waste and M.I.T. respectively)”. (Gran Turk Post Hr’g Br. 10-11.)

         Nonetheless, we noted in CUP, supra, that a protester ranking third among offerors had
standing to challenge the award because it challenged the integrity of the evaluation process.
Assuming arguendo, that the protester contends that standing is conferred under the principle
articulated in CUP, supra, we disagree. In In Re Thomas, CAB No. P579, 46 D.C. Reg. 4618
(May 11, 1999), we noted that a protester challenging “the integrity of the manner in which the
agency officials scored all the offerors” must show how the higher-ranked offerors were
improperly evaluated “such that the protester would be in line for award if his protest grounds
were sustained”. Id.

        Accordingly, we find nothing in the record that shows that the District’s belated email
request for clarification of certain equipment characteristics resulted in improper scoring that
would render Gran Turk next in line for award. The record shows that prior to the request for
email clarification, Waste, M.I.T., and Gran Turk were found responsive and ranked one, two,
and three respectively on the basis of price. (AR, Ex. 10.) After the series of email exchanges
between April 5-7, 2011, Waste, M.I.T. and Gran Turk were still found responsive by the
District, and still ranked one, two, and three respectively. Though admittedly unusual, the
District’s request for email clarifications herein had no impact on M.I.T.’s ranking as second low
bidder and Gran Turk’s ranking as third. Gran Turk has not establish a nexus between the
District’s request for email clarifications and how M.I.T.’s bid was improperly evaluated “such
that [Gran Turk] would be in line for award if [its] protest grounds were sustained”.

         Accordingly, Gran Turk’s protest is dismissed with prejudice. Gran Turk would not be
next in line for award if the protest against Waste were sustained and therefore lacks standing.
