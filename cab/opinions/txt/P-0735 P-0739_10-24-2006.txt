             Protestor’s Response to the District’s Motion to Correct Opinion and
                   Request for Reconsideration of Order Denying Protests

        Urban Service Systems Corporation (Urban) hereby joins the motion of the District

of Columbia (District) to “correct its Opinion”1 dated October 16, 2006 because it omits

facts critical to the resolution of these consolidated cases. In addition, and pursuant to CAB

Rule 117.2,Urban requests that this Board reconsider its opinion and issue specific findings

of fact in support of an order that conforms evidence Urban submitted in support of its

motion for partial summary judgment on July 21, 2006. In support of this response and

request, Urban states as follows:

        1.       On October 16, 2006, this Board denied Urban’s consolidated protests noting

(Order at 1) that “the District has moved to dismiss the current protests on the grounds

that the new protests are untimely and that the Board previously considered and decided

        1
          The District does not appear to ask this Board to “correct” any sort of typographical error. Rather,
the District seems to ask the Board to issue new findings of fact to support its contention that TAC was
entitled to certification as an LSDBE as of February 2006. Insofar as the District is seeking reconsideration of
the opinion to conform to the evidence submitted by the parties, Urban joins that request.

                                                       1
against Urban on the same issues raised here.” After finding no jurisdictional impediment

to consideration of the protests, the Board held

              We conclude that the contracting officer did not violate the
              law, regulations, or the terms of the solicitation in deciding to
              award to TAC on the basis of the bids opened on August 30,
              2005. Because bids are evaluated as of bid opening date, in this
              case August 30, 2005, TAC was properly certified through a
              provisional certification and entitled to a 9 percent reduction
              in its bid prices as we previously held in CAB No. P-0714.

(Order at 2). In reaching that conclusion, the Board stated

              Urban understandably challenges the now-expired provisional
              certification and asks us again to independently review the
              certification of TAC to protect the integrity of the procurement.
              We declined to do so in CAB No. P-0714 because the
              exceptional circumstances provoking such a review were not
              present . . .As of August 30, 2005, the DSLBD/OLBD made a
              provisional recertification of TAC which we held to entitle
              TAC to a 9 percent bid preference. Urban successfully
              challenged the recertification of TAC before the SLBOC,
              however, the denial of recertification occurred on November
              8, 2005, well after bid opening. Because the law is clear that
              preferences are determined for price evaluation purposes at
              the time of bid opening . . . the subsequent denial cannot
              retroactively changed the bid price evaluations as of August
              30, 2005.

(Order at 6) (emphasis supplied);

        2.    The Board did not, however, address - or even mention - Urban’s motion for

partial summary judgment or the “exceptional circumstances” identified therein. The

failure to address Urban’s motion under applicable precedent is reversible error, as we now

show.

        By motion dated July 21, 2006 (Transaction No. 11861106 ), Urban moved for partial


                                             2
summary judgment arguing (Mot. at 3-4)

              Three out-of-state companies, not individuals, owned TAC, a Delaware
              corporation, on August 30, 2005 (Ex. 2 at 41-4). At that time, TAC garaged all
              of its trucks -its physical resources to provide transportation and hauling
              services - in Maryland and Virginia rather than in the District (Ex. 2 at 9, 14
              and 21). TAC had contracts valued at more than Twenty-two Million Dollars
              at the time and a bonding capacity of Ten Million Dollars (Ex. 3; Ex. 2 at
              34-5). A bonding capacity of Ten Million Dollars indicates that TAC had
              access to an individual or firm with sufficient assets to guarantee the bond
              at its face value (Affidavit of Edward J. Casselle, attached hereto a made a
              part hereof as Ex. 4);

              TAC clearly was not entitled to certification as an LBE at bid opening on
              August 30, 2005 because it maintained its physical resources (trucks) outside
              of the District. Moreover, TAC was not entitled to DBE status on August 30,
              2005, because it admittedly was able to post a Ten Million Dollar
              performance bond for a previous contract (Ex. 2 at34-5). To post that bond
              TAC, and the company or individual that provided its backing on the bond,
              would have had to demonstrate financial resources in the face amount of the
              bond, e.g., Ten Million Dollars. Individuals or companies holding more than
              Ten Million Dollars in credit clearly are not disadvantaged within the
              meaning of the LSDBE statute;

       3.     In support of its argument that TAC was not entitled to any preference points

as of the bid opening on August 30, 2005, Urban filed a statement of undisputed facts that

the District failed to dispute or oppose. When the District failed to dispute those facts, this

Board was required to deem them admitted. Beard v. Banks, 2006 U.S. LEXIS 5176 (June 28,

2006) (holding that a non-moving party who fails to “challenge the facts identified in the

[moving party’s] statement of undisputed facts . . . is deemed to have admitted the validity

of the facts”). Therefore, this Board was required to deem the following facts as admitted:

              a.     The District issued TAC a temporary certification on August 30, 2005.

              b.     In 2005, TAC was owned by three out-of-state companies.


                                              3
              c.     In 2005, TAC was incorporated in Delaware.

              d.     In 2005, TAC garaged all of its trucks in Maryland and Virginia.

              e.     In 2005, less than 10% of TAC’s workforce was located in the District.

              f.     In 2005, TAC had a bonding capacity of Ten Million Dollars.

              g.     In 2005, TAC expended more on administrative expenses in
                     Pennsylvania than it did in the District.

              h.     In 2005, TAC had annual revenues of at least $22,000,000.00.

Indeed, the task of this Board on Urban’s motion for partial summary judgment was to

determine whether, on the basis of those undisputed facts, it was entitled to summary

judgment on its argument that as of August 30, 2005, TAC was not properly certified as an

LSDBE because if failed to meet the then-extant requirements for certification under

District law. Indeed, it was this Board’s task, in reviewing Urban’s motion for partial

summary judgment, to look at all of the “pleadings . . . together with the affidavits” to

determine where Urban was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. SCR 56(c). This Board

thus was required to determine whether TAC was entitled to certification as an LSDBE

based on the above undisputed facts and the affidavit of Urban’s expert witness who

opined that “to acquire a Ten Million Dollar performance bond in the manner described

by Mr. Adolph in his sworn testimony of November 8, 2005, TAC would have had to have

a current line of credit available at the bonding company or financial institution issuing its

stand-by letter of credit in an amount at least equal to the amount of the bond” (Affidavit

of Edward J. Casselle, Ex. 4 to Protestor’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment at ¶4). The

Board’s failure to apply applicable standards and precedent to its review of Urban’s motion

                                              4
for partial summary judgment is, accordingly, reversible error. The Board should correct

that error promptly;

        4.       The District asks this Board to issue an opinion based on the fact that the

SLBOC re-certified TAC on February 12, 2006. Urban joins in the request that the Board

correct the record to reflect that re-certification with the caveat that, as indicated on the

District’s Ex. 2 to the instant motion, TAC’s re-certification was not made retroactive to

August 30, 2005. Urban also requests that this Board issue an additional finding of fact that

as of February 12, 2006, and based on that re-certification, TAC was only entitled to the 6%

preference point reduction reflected in the District’s Ex. 2, the official record of the DSLBD,

and not the 9% preference point reduction it previously had received based on the

provisional certification.2

        By requesting that additional finding of fact, the District again puts before the Board

the legal question of whether a provisional certification by the DSLBD that entitles a

company to a 9% bid price reduction survives a subsequent final certification by the SLBOC

that entitles a company to only a 6% bid price reduction. If the Board continues to find

that, as a matter of law, a provisional certification by staff on the date of bid opening

operates as a “grandfather” provision so as to grant a company a continuing certification

not subject to revision upon final review by the SLBOC, it should identify the provision of


        2
         Although the District failed to submit a statement of undisputed facts with its motion to dismiss,
Urban is willing to stipulate that the SLBOC certified TAC in February 2006, entitling it to six preference
points (Protest No. P-0739, Ex. L; District Ex. 2 to the instant motion) if the District also will stipulate that in
M arch 2006 the SLBOC reported Urban as being entitled to seven preference points (Protest No. P-0737, Ex.
M ). As we have shown previously, when TAC’s bid price is adjusted by 6% only (based on its entitlement
to a 6% preference point reduction ) Urban is the lowest bidder for Award Group I.

                                                         5
law - or the controlling precedent of the Court of Appeals - that supports so unique a

holding;3

        5.         Finally, the Board should amend its opinion to explain how the decision by

a staff member of the DSLBD to issue a provisional certification without any reference to

the statutory requirements for certification fails to rise to the level of an “exceptional

circumstance” that would justify Board review of that action under its decision in C&D Tree

Service, Inc., CAB No. P-0440, Mar. 11, 1996, 44 D.C. Reg. 6426, 6433-6439, when the SLBOC

declined to ratify the provisional certification for nearly six months. That circumstance is

made all the more exceptional by the undisputed facts showing that at the time of bid

opening on August 30, 2005 - and the contemporaneous issuance of the provisional

certification - TAC was not entitled to any bid price reduction because it was a Delaware

company, owned by three out-of-state companies, that garaged all of its trucks outside of

the District, employed a workforce made up of more than 90% non-District residents and

had a bonding capacity of Ten Million Dollars. Further compounding the “exceptional”

nature of the circumstances surrounding TAC’s certification are the undisputed facts that

the SLBOC voted not to certify the company on November 8, 2005 for specific reasons4 and

        3
        Of course, an unreviewed decision by this Board - like those of any fact-finding tribunal - has no
binding or precedential effect.

            The verbatim transcript of that vote reads at pages 83-7, in its entirety

1       CHAIRM AN GLYM PH: Okay. Before we vote, I
2       guess I would like the commissioners to put on the
3        record the concerns that we have, I guess,
4       regarding this.
5       COM M ISSIONER POW ELL: One of my concerns
                                                                                          (continued...)

6    was that his trucking business was located outside
7    the District, and the other thing was that the fee
8    that he would have to pay for his trucks, which
9     Commissioner Gomez indicated was $13,000 a year,
10   and that he had no trucks registered in the
11   District, and his employees, he had--he did
12   indicate he had seven or 14. W hich one?
13   CHAIRM AN GLYM PH: W ell, he said 14, but
14   the UC-30 that he filed as of July 3 1st, 2005
15   showed four.
16   COM M ISSIONER POW ELL: The number of
17   employees that he indicated was questionable to me.
18   CHAIRM AN GLYM PH: Okay. Thank you, sir.
19   Commissioner Gomez?
20   COM M ISSIONER GOM EZ: I find long-term
21   inconsistencies in the participation of the company
22   in this program. His company started in 2000. He
1     has over 100 trucks. That's a lot of equipment for
2    a disadvantaged business. The bonding seems to be
3    backed up by another source, and the preponderance
4    of the business activities of the company take
5    place outside the District of Columbia.
6    The 10 acres and the 115 trucks and the
7    80-some employees outside of the city, the
8    transactions outside, even of M aryland and
9    Virginia, and going to other states and other
10   participants do not seem to be in line with what
11   the program is to nurture and incentivize small
12   businesses, when in fact there are small businesses
13   in the same line of business in the city that are
14   operating and competing for the same kind of work.
15   It may be they don't have the same capacity, but
16   individually they could take pieces of it, not a
17   single company taking all of it. So I think the
18   preponderance of the business activities do not
19   take place within the District of Columbia proper.
20   CHAIRM AN GLYM PH: Commissioner Johns?
21   COM M ISSIONER JOHNS: An applicant for
22   certification as a local, small, disadvantaged
1    business must show that it is a local business by
2    showing evidence that the business's
3    enterprise--the business enterprise's principal
4    office is physically located in the District of
5    Columbia.
6    The law defines principal office as the
7    primary office based upon the totality of the
                                                           (continued...)

         (...continued)
8    business activities in which routine and essential
9    business functions occur.
10   In this case, although TAC's
11   representative, M r. Adolph, testified that certain
12   routine business functions occurred in D.C.,
13   including bookkeeping and other recordkeeping,
14   payroll maintenance, there are also a number of
15   business functions that occur outside of the
16   District, as bookkeeping, payroll maintenance, and
17   there are other things listed in the law as
18   examples--for instance, receipt of business
19   telephone calls, receipt of correspondence, storing
20   of books and records, et cetera.
21   Even M r. Adolph admitted in his testimony
22   that with respect to receipt calls, there are
1    functions that occur in D.C. and outside of D.C.
2    Looking beyond that, there are certain
3    indications that show that further support that the
4    principal business functions are occurring outside
5    of D.C.
6    For instance, when looking at profit and
7    loss from June 2005, it shows a breakdown of
8    administrative salaries, with 21,000 going to D.C.,
9    31,000-plus going to Pennsylvania, and 133,000
10   going to other, which I surmise includes at the
11   very least M aryland.
12   That indicates that there is more
13   administrative functions going on outside of D.C.
14   than in.
15   Also Mr. Adolph testified that he had over
16   100 trucks, none of which are housed in D.C.
17   However, there are some housed in M aryland,
18   Pennsylvania, and Virginia, which I think is a
19   further indicator that principal business functions
20   are occurring outside of D.C.
21   Lastly, he testified that he had over 85
22   employees, and based on the information provided to
1    this comm ission, only four of which are D.C.
2    residents, which I think also gives further
3    indication that the primary focus of this business
4    is more outside of D.C. than in.
5    And with that, that is why I vote to deny
6    TAC Transport.
7    CHAIRM AN GLYM PH: There's nothing more I
8     want to add to the record. I just agree with my
9    fellow commissioners, and I think in looking at
                                                           (continued...)

reversed itself without any explanation in the record of this case on February 16, 2006. The

totality of undisputed facts here constitutes such “exceptional circumstances” as to require

this Board to look behind the provisional certification issued to TAC on August 30, 20055

and conclude that on that date TAC was not entitled to a bid price reduction of any kind

and, accordingly, that it was not the successful bidder for Award Group I.

        WHEREFORE, Urban joins the request of the District for re-issuance of its order of

October 16, 2006 to include all omitted findings of fact.

          At a very minimum, the Board should define precisely the circumstances that constitute the
“exceptional circumstances” necessary for review of an SLBOC certification since we have shown repeatedly
that the SLBOC “abdicated its function” to certify TAC in accord with law in this case, the only “exceptional
circumstance” thus far defined by the Board, and explain precisely how Urban has failed to make a case of
“exceptional circumstances.”
