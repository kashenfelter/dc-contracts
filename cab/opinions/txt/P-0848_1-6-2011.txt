      For the Protester, Warner H. Session, Esq. For the District of Columbia
Government: Robert Schildkraut, Esq., Assistant Attorney General.

      Opinion by Administrative Judge Warren J. Nash, with Chief Administrative
Judge Marc D. Loud, Sr., concurring.

                               CORRECTED OPINION
                                    Filing ID 35350990

         Community Bridge, Inc., (“Community Bridge”) on April 9, 2010, protested the
award of any contract from the above solicitation to any bidder other than Community
Bridge. On April 27, 2010, the District of Columbia filed its motion to dismiss the
protest, alleging that Community Bridge had filed an untimely protest more than 10 days
after it knew, or should have known, of the grounds of its protest. The District on April
12, 2010, executed a Determination and Finding to proceed with contract performance.
Community Bridge filed its opposition to the D&F on April 15, 2010. Since we have
determined that the protest was untimely filed, there is no need to determine the adequacy
of the D&F. The Board agrees with the District and the Board hereby dismisses the
protest with prejudice.

                                   BACKGROUND

        The Office of Contracting and Procurement (“OCP”) of the District Government
issued solicitation DCKT -2009-R-0120 in the open market for grounds maintenance and
landscaping services on September 23, 2009. (Exhibit 2). The solicitation required a
prospective contractor to provide grounds maintenance, landscaping services and other
related services to several District agencies. (Exhibit 2). The District contemplated
award of multiple contracts, and the District wanted to award single contracts to one
contractor in each ward of the city. (Exhibit 2). Community Bridge submitted a proposal
to provide services under the RFP, and was awarded a contract on April 3, 2010.
(Exhibit 8). Community Bridge is protesting the award of contracts to Lorenz for
services in Wards 3 through 8. The District awarded a contract to Lorenz, Inc., on April
13, 2010. Community Bridge filed this protest on April 9, 2010.

                                     DISCUSSION

       In the motion to dismiss, the District alleges 1) that Community Bridge lacks
standing to protest because the protest was filed after March 17, 2010, and was therefore
-2-                                                     Community Bridge, Inc., CAB No. P-0848


untimely, and that 2) alternatively, the protest is untimely because it was filed more than
10 days after the district submitted the Lorenz and Community Bridge approval
resolutions on March 12, 2010, and that Community Bridge knew about the adverse
action taken against its interest by March 16, 2010, the date that Community Bridge’s
attorney submitted an email message to Councilmember Jim Graham that outlined the
reasons for Community Bridge’s support of a disapproval resolution submitted by
Councilmember Harry Thomas, Jr. The District alleges that Community Bridge knew
that the award resolution had been sent to the Council, and that Community Bridge
actively lobbied against award of the companion contract to Lorenz. The District further
alleges that since Community Bridge knew of the Lorenz award by March 16, 2010, any
protest of the award to Lorenz should have been earlier than April 9, 2010, or by March
30, 2010. Therefore, this protest is untimely.

        The District correctly cites Sigal Construction Corporation, DCCAB No. P-0690,
P-0693, P-0694 (Consolidated)(2004) to support the proposition that in certain cases of
active lobbying of the DC Council by a protester, the timeliness of a protest may be
affected by the actions of the protester. In Sigal, the protester actively worked to
convince the Council to disapprove a proposed award to a competing contractor.
However, Sigal’s protest was untimely because it was filed more than 10 business days
after Sigal’s actual notice that a proposed award had been submitted to the Council. Sigal
did not receive a formal notice of the proposed award, but it actively lobbied the council
against approving the award.

       In Sigal, the Board set forth the parameters to be used when considering the
timeliness of a protest that involves active council lobbying by the protester:

       The Procurement Practices Act provides the following in D.C. Code § 2-
       309.08 with regard to an award protest:

        (a) This section shall apply to a protest of a solicitation or award of a
       contract addressed to the Board by any actual or prospective bidder,
       offeror, or contractor who is aggrieved in connection with the solicitation
       or award of a contract.

        ....

        (b)(2) In cases other than those [based upon alleged improprieties in a
       solicitation] . . . , protests shall be filed not later than 10 business days
       after the basis of protest is known or should have been known, whichever
       is earlier.

        The correct principle of law on timeliness of a protest in connection with
       an award is that the 10-business day period stated in D.C. Code § 2-309.08
       begins when the bidder or offeror knows or should have known the basis
       of its protest and the party has become aggrieved in connection with the
       award by an official action adverse to that party. JLTJV (Jair
-2-                                                    Community Bridge, Inc., CAB No. P-0848


      Lynch/Tompkins Joint Venture) misconstrues our decision in Micro
      Computer. That case addressed the issue of the timeliness of a protest
      filed against the presumptive low bidder even though no award had been
      made. Micro Computer simply stands for the proposition that the Board
      may entertain jurisdiction over a protest which technically is premature
      because there has been no formal action taken by the contracting officer
      adverse to the protester. There is no difficulty in such an approach
      because if the presumptive low bidder does not receive award or the
      protester receives the award, the protest will be moot and voluntary
      dismissal will follow. See, e.g., Consolidated Waste Industries, CAB No.
      P-0300, Oct. 8, 1992, 40 D.C. Reg. 4570. If the protester does not receive
      award, the Board can then resolve the protest based on an actual decision
      adverse to the protester. Further, it may be useful for the contracting
      officer and government legal counsel to learn of a protest ground even if
      prematurely filed because the agency may be expected to take a more
      informed contract action based on the issues raised in the protest.

       Usually, the contracting officer's official action adverse to the party will
      be a notice of award, a notice of intent to award, a notice that the party did
      not receive award, a notice that the party's bid or offer will not be further
      considered in the procurement, a notice that the party's offer is not within
      the competitive range, or a notice that the bid or offer is rejected for some
      other reason. It is well settled in our cases that a bidder or offeror does not
      have to file a protest in connection with an award until it has received
      notice of an official action by the contracting officer which is adverse to it.
      See, e.g., Unfoldment, Inc., CAB No. P-0447, Aug. 2, 1996, 44 D.C. Reg.
      6488, 6490-91 (protester's challenge to an anticipated award to the
      incumbent and an affirmative determination of the incumbent's
      responsibility status is premature and speculative); Consolidated Waste
      Industries, CAB No. P-0430, June 12, 1995, 42 D.C. Reg. 4983 (protester
      merely surmises that the District intends to award the IFB to another
      bidder; since the District had not yet completed its responsibility
      determination nor awarded a contract; protest was premature). In
      Alexandria Scale, CAB No. P-0361, Mar. 25, 1993, 40 D.C. Reg. 5055,
      the facts showed bid opening on June 12, 1992, that protester notified the
      contracting officer by letter of June 23 that the low bidder could not meet
      the specifications, and that between June 18 and December 14, 1992, the
      contracting agency made inquiries to the low bidder seeking responses to
      protester's June 23 letter. On January 7, 1993, after a partial award was
      made to the low bidder, the protester filed its protest on January 14, 1993,
      7 days after award, but months after being on notice of the underlying
      basis for the protest. The Board held that the protest was timely filed
      because the operative date for starting the 10-day filing period was the
      date on which the bidder was notified of the adverse agency action --
      January 7, 1993, in that case. In Koba Associates, Inc., CAB Nos. P-0344,
      P-0359, Mar. 3, 1993, 40 D.C. Reg. 5003, we held that the 10-day period
-2-                                                     Community Bridge, Inc., CAB No. P-0848


       for filing a protest begins to run when the District takes adverse action to
       the concerns of the offeror, not when the offeror raises the issues in a letter
       to the contracting officer seeking clarification. In Koba, the protester
       sought clarification by letter of August 27, 1992, challenging a direction
       given by the contracting agency during discussions, but the 10-day time
       for filing its protest began to run when protester received the September
       24, 1992 notice terminating negotiations. Thus, Koba's protest was timely
       filed on October 7, 1992. See also Fort Myer Construction Corp., CAB
       No. P-0261A, Jan. 28, 1992, 39 D.C. Reg. 4400 (although Fort Myer was
       aware of low bidder's bid mistake at the time of bid opening on October
       10, 1990, it was not aggrieved until November 1, 1990, when the District
       informed Fort Myer that the low bidder's error was not disqualifying).

        Under these principles of timeliness, we conclude that Community Bridge
untimely raised the protest grounds on April 9, 2010. The documents submitted by the
protester clearly show that the Community Bridge knew on March 16, 2010, that Lorenz
would be awarded the contract after the contract was approved by Council. Further,
Community Bridge lobbied the Council by attempting to stall, or end, the approval of the
contract. Community Bridge filed this protest more than 10 days after it attempted to
lobby the Council to disapprove the contract. Accordingly, we dismiss this protest as
untimely.
