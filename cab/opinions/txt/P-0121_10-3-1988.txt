     For the Protester: Harvey Shanes, President.               For the Government:      Nancy

      Opinion by Administrative Judge Sharpe 1 with Administrative Judges Booker and
Davis concurring.

                                              OP1NION

       The Clothes Barn filed this protest on July 26, 1988. 2 On August 25, 1988, the
District moved the Board to dismiss the protest for lack of timely filing. Clothes Barn
did not respond to the District's motion.

             Clothes Barn's protest letter includes the following statement:

                 Enclosed please find a copy of (sic) letter to Mr. Bruce Gordon dated
             June 30, 1988. As per Mr. Gordon's advice, this letter [the June 30, 1988
             letter] is being forwarded to your department [the Board] so that this
             protest may formally be put on record.

(Emphasis added.) In the June 30 letter addressed to Mr. Gordon (at the time, Mr.
Gordon was serving as the Acting Associate Director, Materiel Management
Administration, Department of Administrative Services), Clothes Barn challenges two of
the bids responding to IFB No. 8294-AA-84-0-8-MW ("Clothing-Male and Female/ Shoes").


lIJudge Sharpe's participation in this case is pursuant to the authority contained in the
D,C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985, D.C. Code, ยง 1-1189.2(c)(2) (1987 Replacement).

 yrhis case originated during the period when the District of Columbia Contract Appeals
Board was functioning pursuant to Commissioner's Order No.9, D.C. Code, Supplement
V (1987), as amended by Mayor's Order 86-65, 33 DCR 3006 (May 16, 1986). Pursuant
to the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985 (PPA), D.C. Code, ยง 1-1189.1 (1987), a new
independent agency denominated as the Contract Appeals Board was created. This new
Board became operational on August 1, 1988, and succeeded to the jurisdiction of all cases
pending before the previously established Board.

            The District correctly notes that under the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985
    (PPA) , D.C. Code, ยง 1-1189.8(b)(1987), in order for a protest before this Board to be
    timely, it must have been filed within ten working days after the party knew or should
    have known of its protest grounds. The District initially argues that Clothes Barn knew
    or should have known of its grounds of protest on the bid opening date (June 23, 1988).
    In the alternative, the District argues that Clothes Barn knew or should have known of
    its protest grounds no later than June 30, 1988 (the date of the previously mentioned
    letter from Clothes Barn to Mr. Gordon).

           We need only address the District's alternative argument. Clothes Barn's use of
    the June 30, 1988 letter to Mr. Gordon to state its protest grounds provides clear evidence
    that Clothes Barn actually knew of its grounds of protest no later than June 30, 1988.
    Thus, the ten-working day period prescribed in ยง 1-1189.8(b) of the PPA for filing a
    protest began to run here as of June 30, 1988. Since we did not receive Clothes Barn's
    protest until July 26, 1988 (more than ten working days after June 30, 1988), the protest
    is untimely. While it is unfortunate that Clothes Barn was apparently unaware of the
    statutory, ten-working day requirement for filing a protest with this Board, this
    circumstance cannot excuse Clothes Barn's failure to comply with the filing requirement.
    See MTI Construction Company. Inc., 1 P.D. 66 (D.C. CAB 1987).


                                             ORDER

            The protest is dismissed, with prejudice, as untimely.
