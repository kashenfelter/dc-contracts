                                                 OPINION

       On November 6. 2000. B&B Security Consultants, Inc. ("B&B Security") filed a protest
challenging the District's award of a contract to Heritage Services. Inc. ("Heritage") under the
Federal Supply Schedule ("FSS")II to provide security services for the Commission for Mental
Health Services ("CMIlS") facilities. B&B Security was tbe incumbent contr(]ctor prior to award.
On November 9. 2000, B&B Security voluntarily withdre\v one of the two protest grounds of
challenge. 2 Under the remaining protest ground, B&B Security alleged violation of 27 DCMR
§21 03.4(b). which governs when it is mandatory for the District to purchase from the FSS.

       On November 27.2000, the District filed a motion to dismiss. The Intervenor filed a motion
to dismiss the protest on December 7,2000.

        On December 6, 2000. B&B Security filed an amended protest, alleging abuse of the
procurement process and multiple violations of 27 DCMR ~21 03. B&B Security concluded that
the contracting officer lacked authority to make award to Heritage under the FSS. On December 28.
2000. the District and Heritage filed motions to dismiss the amended protest.

        Both the District anel Heritage challenge B&B Security's standing to protest under the FSS.
They both argue that the District had the authority and acted in compliance with the law in procuring
under the FSS. In support of their motions to dismiss the amended protest the District and Heritage
also argue that the amended protest grounds are untimely filed and are otherwise without merit.

    B&B Security filed a voluntary dismissed it allegation that the District violated D.C. Code 27 DCMR ~ 6049
governing removal of the contract from the sheltered market. (Voluntary Dismissal of Second Basis of Protest).

        The Protester responds that it is an aggrieved, sufficiently injured and interested party which
has standing to protest; that its amended protest is timely; and that the District has violated District
procurement law.

       We conclude that B&B Security's challenge to the District's decision to use the FSS is
untimely and that the Protester lacks standing to protest the procedures leading to award of the
contract to Heritage under the FSS. Accordingly, the protest is dismissed.

                                            BACKGROUND

        On November 1, 1999, the District competitively awarded Contract No. RM-99-C-0044-AS
to B&B Security to provide uniformed security services. This contract was for a base year period
from November 11, 1999 to November 10.2000, with four option years. On September 8. :2000. the
Contracting Officer served B&B Security with preliminary notice of the District's intention to
exercise the first year option. The September 8 letter also informed B&B Security that the
preliminary notice did not obligate the District to exercise the option. (AR. Ex. 17). On September
 11.2000. the Interim Director of Administration/Chief of Facilities Ivlanagement. CMHS. informed
the Contracting Officer that CMHS did not wish to extend the contract with B&B Security. (Id).
The September 11,2000, Memorandum also informed the Contracting Officer of CMHS' s interest
in obtaining security services from a FSS contractor. and mentioned that CMHS officials had held
an introductory meeting with officials from Heritage Services. Inc. (Id)

        On September 26.2000. the Contracting Officer notified B&B Security that the District had
decided not to exercise the first year option of its contract and had instead decided to use a FSS
contract to procure security services. (AR, Ex. 17). CMHS issued three determination and findings
documents related to the use of the FSS other than the Determination to Proceed' : (I) a
Determination and Findings For Using FSS ("Initial D&F') dated October 4. 2000, (AR, Ex. 18);
(2) a Determination and Findings to Supplement For Using FSS, ("D&F Supplement'") also dated
October 4.2000. (AR. Ex. 19); and (3) a Corrected Supplement to Determination and Findings To
Use FSS ("Corrected D&F Supplement") dated November 29.2000 which the District substituted
in lieu of the D&F Supplement. 4!

       In the initial D&F. the Contracting Officer concluded that security services should be
procured under the FSS. (AR, Ex. 18). 1n the subsequent D&F Supplement and Corrected D&F
Supplement the Contracting Officer further identified its selection of FSS 539. Special Item
Number (SIN) 246-54 Guard Services. (AR. Ex. 19). In the Initial D&r. the Contracting OiTicer


    Discussed infi'a at note 6.

    The District explained that 011 or about November 20, 2000. the Contracting Officer executed a D&F
Supplement which was incorrectly dated October 4, 2000 and which contained clerical mistakes and errors. The
District did not identify the mistakes and errors. (Corrected D&F Supplement ~4(d))
                                                                                                            [8129J

                                                                      CAB No. P-630

also listed a number of problems with B&B Security's performance. (AR, Ex. 18, ~4(a»).

        In the Corrected D&F Supplement the Contracting Offi cer found that CMH S required special
features in security services to ensure effective program performance; and that such security services
were not available from other government supply sources which met CMHS's minimum needs. The
Corrected D&F Supplement also described the procedures that CMHS followed in utilizing the FSS.

        On November 1. 2000, the District issued Purchase Order No. PI 000097 to Heritage. under
FSS 539 SIN 246-54, Guard Services, Contract No. GS-07F-0364K to provide security services for
CMHS facilities for a l20-day period from November 11.2000 through March 10,2001. (AR. Ex.
21. Purchase Order; AR, Ex. 22, FSS). The purchase order hourly rate was $13.51 for Guard Type
I services and $17.79 for Guard Type II services. The total amount av\'arded under the purchase
order was $923,324.40.

        On November 6, 2000, B&B Security filed its initial protest challenging the District's award
to Heritage. On November 9, ::2000. the Contracting Officer IActing Chief, OCP. exercised a partial
option with B&B Security and extended the term of the contract from November 11.2000 through
December 1CL 2000. On November 17, 2000. Heritage filed as an Intervenor in the protest
proceeding.

       On December 8, 2000. pursuant to D.C. Code 1-1189.8(c)(2) (Supp.1998). the Interim
Director (OCP) executed and the District filed its "Determination and Findings to Proceed With
Performance Pursuant to an Order under a Contract under a FSS After filing of a Protest by B&B
Security Consultants, Inc." ("D&f to Proceed"'). On December 22, 2000. the Board sustained the
determination by the Interim Director which allowed the District to proceed with performance with
Heritage. (Board's Order Denying Protester's Motion to Override Determination to Proceed. dated
December 22.2000).

                  The Initial and Amended Protests and the Motions to Dismiss

The Initial Protest

         B& B Security argues that the Heritage contract violates the provisions of District law
governing the requirements for purchasing through the FSS. B&B Security argues that the District's
use of the FSS is governed by 27 DCMR 92103 and is mandatory where the fSS price is lower than
the price obtainable with a ne\y contract and where the District's minimum needs are met. However.
B&B Security contends that the District failed to meet either of these requirements. since Heritage' s
prices are higher than B&B Security's and the $200J)00 maximum limitation for FSS purchases will
110t meet the District's needs. thereby requiring a series of $200,000 purchase orders resulting in a

 cumulative order in excess of the maximum limitation. Fur~her. B&B Security argues that the
 District's D&F finding that the price requirement was met is false, arbitrary and an abuse of
 discretion. (Initial Protest),

 The Amended Protest

          Additionally B&B Security's amended protest alleges that: (l) The Contracting Officer
  lacked authority to issue a purchase order to Heritage in excess of the $200,000 maximum order
. limitation; (2) CMHS abused the procurement process in making an illegal sole source award to
  Heritage and by applying the wrong standard in making its determination to justify use ofthe GSA
  Schedule: and (3) the District improperly cited FAR §8.404(b )(3) as authority for using the FSS.
  rather than Title 27 which limits awards under the FSS. B&B Security asserts standing based on
  direct economic interest in the procurement of security services by the District.

 The Motions to Dismiss

          The District and the Intervenor move to dismiss B&B Security's protests primarily arguing
 that B&B Security lacks standing to protest because B&B Security is not 011 the FSS. is not eligihle
 to compete for orders under the FSS and is not an actual or prospective supplier v,hose direct
 economic interest would be effected. They assert that B&B Security would not be in line fcn award
 even if the amended protest were sustained. (Motion to Dismiss the Amended Protest). The District
 also contends that District procurement regulations and FAR authorize the District to use the FSS
 at its option. and that in this case FSS use was optional. The District argues that it is in compliance
 with the authority for optional use of a FSS per 27 DCMR ~21 00 (i), §21 03.4 and ~21 04, FAR
 §8.404 (b). FSS 539 §552.216-72. and GSA Order ADM 4800.2(d) and therefore compliance with
 requirements governing mandatory use of the FSS is not applicable.(AR, Ex. 18: D&F. Ex. 1). With
 respect to the amended protest grounds, the District contends that they are untimely and should be
 dismissed.

                                            DISCUSSION

         The threshold issues in this matter are whether B&B Security could challenge the District's
 use of the FSS. whether that challenge was timely, and whether B &B Security has standing to
 protest the procedures that the District used in securing the services of Heritage.

         Section 903 of the D.C. Procurement Practices Act CPP A"). D.C. Code                      ~ 1-1189.3.
 establishes the Board's protest jurisdiction and provides in pertinent part:

         The Board shall be the exclusive hearing tribunal for. and shall have jurisdiction to review
 ancl determine de novo:

                 (1) Any protest of a solicitation or award of a contract addressed to the Board by an
         actual or prospective bidder or offeror. or a contractor who is aggrieved in connection with
         the solicitation or award of a contract. , ..

Section 908 (c) of the PPA, D.C. Code § 1-1189.8 (c), establishes the Boarers standard of review:

               (c) On any direct protest ... the Board shall promptly decide whether the
       solicitation or award was in accordance with the applicable lav./. regulations and
       terms and conditions of the solicitation. The proceeding shall be de novo. Any prior
       determinations by administrative officials shall not be final or conclusive.

        Consistent with the PP A, we have held that only "aggrieved"' persons have standing in
protests before the Board. In order to have standing, an actual or prospective bidder or offeror must
show that it has suffered. or will suffer. a direct economic injury as a result of the alleged adverse
agency action. Recycling Solutions, Inc, CAB No. P-377, Apr. 15, 1994.42 D.C. Reg. 4550,4575
citing District olColumbia 1'. Group Insurance Administratiol1, 633 A.2d 2.18-19 (D.C. 1993):
Micro Computer Co., CAB No. P-226. May 12. 1992,40 D.C. Reg. 4388,4390-91. It is a \vell
settled principle that a protester lacks standing where it would not be in line for award even if its
protest were sustained. St. John's Community Services, CAB No. P-555, Mar. ~3. 1999.46 D.C.
Reg. 7695. 7697; CPF Corporation, CAB No. P-521. Jan. 12, 1998.45 D.C. Reg. 8697. 8699;
American Combllstion Industries, Inc., CAB No. P-499. Aug. 14. 1997.44 D.C. Reg. 6896.

        The Board has also held that where a protester was not a contractor on the FSS that the
protester lacked standing to challenge the award by the District to a vendor on the FSS. AIADI AC
1m 'lIne.. CAB No. P-595, Nov. 18. 1999, 11 P.D. 7812. 7813; Remco Business S~vstems, 1I1C., CAB
No. P-131, Dec. 30,1988.36 D.C. Reg. 4016, 4017.

        Were the Board to decide that the District's use of the FSS was illegal. the District would
have to procure its service needs either by exercising its option with B&B Security or resoiiciting
the contract in the open market. In either case, B&B Security would have a possibility of receiving
the award. B&B Security therefore had standing to challenge the legality of the use of the FSS.
However. \ve find that B&B Security's challenge to the District's use of the FSS is untimely. The
record reveals that CMHS informed B&B Security of its intention to use the FSS to secure security
sen'ices in a letter dated September 26. 2000.(AR. Ex. 18). B&B did not file its protest with the
Board until November 6, 2000. Even adding fi.ve days to account for mailing, the Board finds that
B&B Security received notice ofthe District's intentions on October 2.2000 (October 1.2000 was
a Sunday). To be timely B&B should have filed a protest concerning the District's use of the FSS
by October 16, 2000. ten business days from the date B&B Security should have received the
September 26 letter notif-ying it of CMHS' s decision to use the FSS.
                                                                                                 [81321



                                               -6-             B&B Security Consulfants. illc.
                                                               CAB No. P-630

       We also find that B&B Security is not a FSS contractor and could not receive a FSS contract
under any circumstance. Therefore, B&B Security lacks the requisite standing to challenge the FSS
procedures that the District used in awarding a contract to Heritage.

       Accordingly, the protest is dismissed with prejudice.


SO ORDERED.
