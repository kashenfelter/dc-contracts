            BACKGROUND

                   On August 13, 1990, the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) issued RFP
            No. 0290-AA-NS-I-SG (RFP) "for hauling and utilization of sludge from the Blue Plains
            Wastewater Treatment Plant in Washington, D.C." (Agency Report, Exhibit 1, Section
            A.2).Y The RFP contemplated the hauling and utilization of approximately 1000 wet tons
            of sludge per day over an approximate period of 39 months from the date of contract
            award. It was anticipated that the amount of sludge would decrease to 700 tons per day
            for approximately 21 months thereafter. (AR, Ex. 1, Sec. D.l).Y The original date set for




               I1Hereinafter, references to the Agency Report filed on August 30, 1991, shall be "AR, Ex(s). _" or
           "AR, Ex. - . J Sec. _".

                ~/Section D.l of the RFP lists "acceptable methods of utilization". They are: (1) land application; (2)
           olI-site composting, to include disposal of product; and (3) "[a]ny other slugde disposal technology
           demonstrated at large scale and for sustained periods which meets the terms and conditions of this RFP
           and which is determined advantageous and acceptable to the participating jurisdictions." (emphasis added).

                   The Evaluation Committee was to "... determine the acceptability or unacceptability of the quality
           and efficiency of the methods proposed... " by evaluating: (1) reliability of method; (2) the recycling and
           reuse of nutrients (beneficial use of product); (3) history of community acceptance of sludge disposal in
           impacted areas; (4) overall parity of distribution of sludge between the participating states; (5) impact on
                                                                                                           (continued ... )

             receipt of proposals was September 17, 1990. However, by two addenda, the ultimate date
             set for receipt of proposals was October 31, 1990. (AR, Exs. 2C and 2D). Three other
             addenda were issued, none of which are pertinent here. (AR, Exs. 2A, 2B and 2E).

                   On August 28, 1990, the government held a pre-proposal conference for the purpose
            of questions, comments and information. (AR, Ex. 3). Seven prospective otTerors
            attended: JABB¥, Laidlow Environmental Services, Enviro-Gro, High Tech, MTI,
            YWC/Ad+Soil (YWC), and Recyc Systems. (Id.). Thereafter, the government received
            three otTers: JABB, YWC and MTI-Recyc (MTI).~ (AR, Exs. 4, 5 and 6).




                Y (... continued)
            Blue Plains; and (6) odor control. (AR, Ex. 1, Sec. E.2).

                     The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines "disposal" as ". . . the discharge, deposit,
            injection, dumping, spilling, leaking or placing of any solid waste or hazardous waste into or on any land
            or water so that such solid waste or hazardous waste ... may enter the environment or be committed into
            the air or discharged into any waters, including ground waters." (emphasis added). (Comments of
            YWC/Ad+Soil on the Board Conference, February 10, 1992, Exhibit 2 [Affidavit of John A. O'Neal,
            Attachment 7]).

                     According to a September 1984 publication issued by the EPA entitled "Environmental Regulations
            and Technology, Use and Disposal of Minicipal Wastewater Sludge", five major slugde use/disposal options
            were currently available: (1) land application; (2) distribution and marketing of sludge products; (3)
            landfilIing; (4) incineration; and (5) ocean disposal. (M., Exhibit 2 [Affidavit of John A. O'Neal, Attachment
            1)).
                    According to a March 1989 Draft Environmental Impact Statement issued for the EPA on a sludge
            management study of the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant, land application of dewatered sludge
            was the preferred alternative of disposal studied by the EPA. However, in that study, six other alternatives
            were evaluated: (1) no action; (2) incineration with ash landfiIIing; (3) in-vessel composting and product use;
            (4) heat drying and product use; (5) landfiIIing dewatered sludge; and (6) ocean disposal. (M., Exhibit 2
            [Affidavit of John A. O'Neal, Attachment 2]).

                    Reading the authorities provided in conjunction with the RFP's acceptable methods of utilization
            of wastewater sludge, it is clear that the term "disposal" encompasses "utilization" in a variety of ways and
            technologies, all of which involve sludge management. ~ also MTI-Recyc Comments on Informal

                   An evaluation committee performed preliminary evaluations of the proposals; and
            while it appears that all offers were acceptable, the panel determined that each offeror
            needed to address specific issues about their respective proposals. (AR, Ex. 7).?!

                   Subsequently, the government conducted separate negotiations with each offeror,
            addressing the issues raised by the committee. (AR, Exs. 8A, 8B, 8C and 10). The
            offerors submitted best and final offers (BAFO's) on November 16, 1990. (AR, Exs. 9A,
            9B and 9C). On or about November 20, 1990, the evaluation panel met to review the
            discussions held with the offerors and the resultant BAFO's. (AR, Ex. 10). Thereafter,
            the panel unanimously agreed that JABB was acceptable for 1000 wet tons per day, YWC
            was acceptable for 200 wet tons per day and MTI was acceptable for 200 wet tons per day.
            (Id.).

                 The evaluation committee also reviewed the prices submitted; and based upon a
           comparison of possible price combinations, the panel agreed unanimously that the
           combination of JABB (800 wet tons per day) and YWC (200 wet tons per day) "... was
           the most economically advantageous" and recommended awards to both companies. (Id.).~

                  On June 18, 1991, the government entered into contracts with JABB and YWC.
           (AR, Exs. 11A and 11B).l! The term of each contract is from July 12, 1991, through July
           11, 1993. (Id.). As of August 30, 1991, the contractors had commenced performance.



              :!!The Evaluation Committee consisted of members from the jurisdictions of Prince George's County,
           Montgomery County, Washington, D.C., Fairfax County and the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission
           (WSSC). (AR, Ex. 1, Sec. D.3; Ex. 7).

               ~iSection B.21, subsection A. of the RFP states:

                           The Government will award (a) contract(s) resulting from this solicitation
                           to the responsible otTeror(s) whose otTer(s) conform(s) to the solicitation
                           and is (are) most advantageous to the Government, considering price and
                           other factors specified elsewhere in this solicitation.. . .

                    Subsection C. of Section B.21 states, in pertinent part:

                           ... The District intends to make (an) award(s) for the entire 1000 tons
                           per day to one or more otTeror(s). (The District could award five 200 ton
                           per day contracts if they resulted in the most economically advantageous
                           arrangement for the District.) ....

                ZIThe acceptance period for otTers was 90 days from the date specified for submission of BAFO's, or in
           this case, until sometime around February 14, 1991. By letters dated March 18, 1991, the government
           requested that JABB and Ad +Soil extend their proposals from February 14 through April 30, 1991; and by
           letters dated April 24, 1991, the government requested JABB and Ad+Soil to extend their proposals to June
           30, 1991. The otTerors did so. (AR, Exs. 13A, 13B, 13C and 13D).

           THE PROTEST

                   MTI filed its timely protest with the Board on June 26, 1991, alleging that it was
           an "aggrieved party" within the meaning of D.C. Code §1-1189.8 (1987), in that it was an
           actual otTeror in response to the RFP.!I In its protest, MTI alleged the following:
           (1) that on information and belief, YWC failed to comply with the alleged mandatory
           requirement for "earmarked storage" or alternatively, that the government allegedly waived
           or relaxed the requirement for YWC alone, thereby prejudicing MTI's opportunity to otTer
           a landfill in lieu of storage; (2) that YWC, on information and belief, failed to comply with
           Section D.20 of the RFP ("Special Standards of Responsibility") by not providing valid
           permits from cognizant jurisdictions permitting storage and disposal of Blue Plains sludge
           in the manner required; (3) that on information and belief, JABB could not qualify for
           award of 1000 wet tons per day because it could not provide at least a 60-day storage
           capacity, as required by Section D.16 of the RFP; and (4) that both JABB and YWC were
           not eligible for award because their proposals expired on February 14, 1991. MTI sought
           termination of the contract awards, or if no awards had yet been made, a direction from
           the Board to DAS to award the contracts "... only on a basis consistent with the law and
           regulations."21 Additionally, protestor requested an evidentiary hearing, or in the
           alternative, an informal conference pursuant to Rules 310.1 and 311.1 of the Board's Rules
           of Practice.!W

                  On July 9, 1991, MTI requested leave to take discovery and to that end, submitted
           a request for production of documents and a first set of interrogatories. The motion was
           denied as premature by Order dated July 25, 1991.

                  On August 16, 1991, the government filed a motion, out of time, for an extension
          of time within which to respond to the protest, until August 30, 1991. On the latter date,
          the government filed its Agency Report. Therein, with respect to protestor's allegations
          concerning the waiver or relaxation of storage requirements, the government argued in
          essence that YWC's proposal of a landfill for disposal of sludge during inclement weather,
          in lieu of storage, was a valid disposal technology and met the requirements of the RFP.
          With regard to the allegations concerning YWC's failure to provide valid permits, the
          government set forth specific facts to demonstrate that YWC had complied with Section
          D.20 of the RFP. The same is true with respect to MTl's third allegation that JABB
          failed to meet the storage requirement of the RFP. Finally, with respect to the allegation
          concerning JABB's and YWC's ineligibility for award because of the failure to extend the
          bid acceptance period, the government presented evidence to show that the otTerors had,
          at the government's request, extended the proposal acceptance period. See fn. 7, supra.

                    On September 10,1991, JABB requested an enlargement of time through September
            30, 1991, in which to respond to the Agency Report. On September 11, protestor filed its
            comments to the Agency Report. Therein, MTI stated that it would no longer pursue
            the second, third and fourth bases for its protest. Protestor also asserted that the Agency
            Report veritably admitted that YWC did not propose storage of sludge in violation of the
            alleged mandatory requirement in the RFP. By Order dated September 16, 1991, the
            Board granted JABB's request for an extension of time; and on September 20, 1991, JABB
            filed its comments to the Agency Report.

                   In its comments, JABB argued that MTI had no bases upon which to state that
            YWC's proposal was not in compliance with the RFP because the government had made
            clear that use of a landfill was an acceptable method of disposal. Additionally, JABB
            claimed that to the extent that the RFP permitted the use of a landfill, and to the extent
            that protestor believed that alternative to be unclear, MTI's protest was untimely. Finally,
            JABB argued that termination of the contracts would not be in the best interests of the
            government.

                    On September 26, 1991, protestor filed its reply to JABB's comments, reiterating
            its position that "[r]euse and recycling are at the very heart of this procurement" and that
            the government waived that requirement for ywc.

                  By Order dated December 18, 1991, the Board ordered the parties, inter alia, to
           determine a mutually agreeable date for an informal conference, to be held no later than
           January 30, 1992.!!I Thereafter, the parties arranged to hold the conference on January
           23, 1992. On January 10, 1992, counsel for YWC filed a Notice of Appearance.

                  On January 23, 1992, the Board convened the informal conference. During the
           conference, the Board heard the parties' arguments and clarification concerning the
           purpose of the RFP and the accepted technological methods for sludge utilization and
           disposal. The Board also sought information and heard the parties regarding the purpose
           and need for storage of sludge during inclement weather. Thereafter, the Board gave the
           parties additional time to provide comments and supplements to the record, all of which
           were submitted through March 23, 1992.

                  In its February 10, 1992, comments, the government argued for the first time that
           MTI did not have standing to challenge the contract awards; and consequently, the Board
           lacked jurisdiction over the protest. The government's position was based upon its
           assertion that even if the protest was sustained with regard to YWC's failure to comply
           with the alleged mandatory requirement of the RFP, MTI would not be next in line for
           award and was, therefore, not an "aggrieved" or "interested" party for the purpose of this
           Board's jurisdiction.



               IllThis case was reassigned to Administrative Judge Terry Hart Lee on November 18, 1991.

                    JABB supported the government's position concerning the Board's lack of
            jurisdiction in its February 10, 1992, submission, as did YWC in its comments of the same
            date. Thereafter, on February 21, 1992, protestor submitted its reply to the post-
            conference comments of the other parties. Therein, MTI asserted that it met the
            "aggrieved party" requirement as set forth in D.C. Code §1-1189.8 and in Rule 300.2 of the
            Board's Rules of Practice. Further, protestor argued that it is an "aggrieved" offeror for
            three reasons: (1) it alleged that the government waived the mandatory requirements of
            the RFP and as a result, the minimum relief sought is a reopening of the competition; (2)
            because JABB's second low bid of 1000 wet tons per day was rejected, it is "legally dead";
            and the government no longer has authority to accept it; and (3) JABB is not qualified
            for award of 1000 wet tons per day because it lacked the requisite storage capacity for the
            sludge.


            DECISION

                  With the withdrawal of three of the four counts of MTl's protest, the only allegation
           remaining for consideration is whether YWC failed to comply with the alleged mandatory
           requirement for "earmarked storage" of sludge, or in the alternative, whether the
           government allegedly relaxed or waived the mandatory requirement for YWC alone, thereby
           denying protestor an opportunity to offer a landfill in lieu of storage. However, the
           government and intervenors argued that protestor lacked standing to challenge the awards
           because it would not be next in line for award even if the protest was sustained, and was
           not, therefore, an "aggrieved" or "interested" party for the purpose of the Board's
           jurisdiction.

                  The Procurement Practices Act of 1985, D.C. Code §§1-1181.1, et ~. (1987)
           empowers the Board to review and determine de novo a protest of a solicitation or award
           of a contract by a disappointed bidder or offeror "... who is aggrieved in connection with
           the solicitation or award of a contract...." (emphasis added). D.C. Code §1-1189.3(1).
           However, just what is meant by the term "aggrieved" is nowhere evident in the statute.
           See D.C. Code §1-1181.7. Therefore, as with other matters of statutory interpretation in
           the procurement arena, we must, as we have done previously, turn to the federal
           counterparts of the District's procurement statute to fashion a just and fair interpretation
           of the law.

                  "Protest", as defined in the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (CICA), 31
           U.S.C. § §3551, et seq .

                   . . . means a written objection by an interested party to a solicitation by an
                   executive agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract. . . or a
                   written objection by an interested party to a proposed award or the award
                   of such a contract; ... (emphasis added).

           Id. §3551(2). Under a myriad of decisions, the Comptroller General has determined that
           a protestor will not be deemed "interested" if it would not be in line for award if its
           protest were upheld. See, ~ Four Seas and Seven Winds Travel. Inc., B-244916,

           a party is sufficiently interested for purposes of its jurisdiction, the Comptroller General
           will consider a number of factors, including the nature of the issues raised, the relief
           sought by the protestor and the protestor's status in relation to the procurement. Jack
           Young Associates, Inc., supra.

                   Similarly, the CICA amendments to the Brooks Act, 40 U.S.c. §759(t)(9), define
           the terms "protest" and "interested party" for purpose of the jurisdiction of the General
           Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA) in almost the same language
           as that used by the Comptroller General. Furthermore, with respect to the GSBCA
           jurisdiction over bid protests, both the GSBCA and its appellate tribunal have made it
           clear that only the second lowest bidder has a direct economic interest in the award of a
           contract where the bidders offer essentially the same package of products or services, the
           bids differ materially only as to price, the solicitation itself is not challenged, and there
           is no reason to believe that the second lowest bid is not responsive. The same is true in
           negotiated procurements where compliance with solicitation requirements is at issue.

                   Recently, in its decision in Micro Computer Co., Inc., CAB No. P-226, January 9,
           1992, 39 DCR 4381 (1992), this Board reversed a number of its prior decisions which
           effectively prohibited disappointed bidders from protesting solicitations prior to contract
           award. That decision focused on previously restrictive interpretations of the term "protest"
           as it has developed and is currently used in the procurement arena. The Board also
           stated that the language and construction of Rule 300.2 of the Board's Rules of Practice,
           which is the only place where a purported definition of the term "aggrieved person" is
           found, is entirely inconsistent with the language and intent of Rule 300.1 in the contex1
           of a protest, i.e. a written challenge to a solicitation, proposed award or award of a
           contract. Id. at 4385, fn. 8.

                   On reconsideration in Micro Computer Co., Inc., CAB No. P-226, May 12, 1992, 5
            P.D. 1025, the Board went to great lengths to further explain its position with respect to
            a protestor's standing. Therein, we stated that in government contract cases, the most
            common form of injury is the economic loss which would result from loss of a contract.
            To emphasize our position, we quoted the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
            Circuit in Hayes International Corp. v. McLucas, 509 F.2d 247, 255 (5th Cir. 1975), cert.
            denied 423 U.S. 864 (1975):

                    Unlike the type of delicate question which arises when a plaintiff alleges an
                    injury of a non-economic nature to interests which are widely shared, . . .
                    the economic injury suffered by a losing bidder in seeking a government
                    contract is manifest.... (emphasis added).

            Thus, this Board has gone on record as holding that in order for a protestor to have
            standing for purposes of our jurisdiction, it must have some direct economic interest in
            the procurement in question. In Micro Computer Co., Inc., supra, the protestor was the
            second low bidder; and we held that where the government determined that another
            company was the apparent low bidder, based upon, inter alia, its responsiveness to the
            solicitation, that decision ". . . triggered [the protestor's] threatened economic injury,
            thereby rendering it an 'aggrieved party' for purposes of the Board's jurisdiction." Id. at
            1028.

                  Turning now to the instant matter, the record shows that the method used by the
            government to evaluate and make award (s) was as follows:

                    First, the Evaluation Committee shall determine which proposals are
                    acceptable in the Technical, Experience and Management, and Minority
                    Participation areas, using the evaluation factors set forth in Section E of the
                    RFP,


                   Second, the Evaluation Committee will evaluate prices submitted by
                   acceptable offerors to determine which single offer or combination of offers
                   will result in the most advantageous contract to the District and the user
                   jurisdictions.

                   Third, using the definitive responsibility criteria set forth for RFP Section
                   D.19 Permits,!Y the contracting officer shall determine whether the lowest



               12/Section D.19 of the RFP states:

                    priced otTeror for a proposed individual award item is capable of performing

                    [o]fficer and the Evaluation Committee determine that the otTeror is not
                    capable of performing the tonnage indicated for the individual award item,
                    the contracting officer shall reject the otTer for the individual award item
                    and reevaluate the otTers based on the next lowest priced combination of

                    entire 1000 tons in this manner. (emphasis in text; emphasis added).

            (AR, Ex. 1, Sec. B.21C.) The record also demonstrates that after evaluation of BAFO's,
            the evaluation panel determined that based on tonnage and price, the offers ranked as
            follows:

                                    JABB (800 wet tons)
                                    Ad + Soil (200 wet tons)                  $68,510,500.00

                                    JABB (1000 wet tons)                      $69,306,725.00

                                    JABB (800 wet tons)
                                    MTI.Recyc (200 wet tons)                  $70,644,296.00

           Clearly, the second low offeror was JABB for the entire 1000 tons; and the third low
           combination of otTers was JABB and MTI for 800 tons and 200 tons, respectively. (AR,
           Ex. 10). Consequently, where, as here, there is an intermediate party who has a greater
           interest in the procurement than the protestor, the protestor's interest will be, and is,
           considered too remote to qualify it as an aggrieved or interested party. Jack Young
           Associates. Inc., supra. Moreover, because MTI did not timely contest the tonnage offered
           by JABB or the technical evaluations, we have no reason to believe that MTI would be in
           line for award if this protest was sustained.!1I Id.; Four Seas and Seven Winds Travel.

                    Nevertheless, citing Eklund Infrared, B-238021, March 23, 1990, 90-1 CPD ~328,
            MTI asserted that because it claimed that the government waived or relaxed the
            mandatory requirements for storage, thereby precluding it from having the same
            opportunity to offer a landfill in lieu of storage, it is an "aggrieved party" for the purpose
            of this Board's jurisdiction. Eklund, however, is inapposite.

                    There, the protestor (the third low acceptable offeror) challenged the contract award
            on the basis that the awardee's "equal" product failed to comply with the salient
            characteristics of the brand name identified in the procurement. Too, the agency conceded
            that it had made an award to a nonconforming offeror, thus conceding the merits of the
            protest.MI

                  Here, the government and intervenors strenuously argued and clearly showed that
           storage was not a mandatory requirement; it was simply an option that could be offered
           by a bidder as an interim measure to handle the disposal of sludge in the event of
           inclement weather. Thus, YWC's offer of a landfill for permanent disposal with no storage
           contemplated is clearly another acceptable "... sludge disposal technology demonstrated
           at large scale and for sustained periods. . .." (AR, Ex. 1, Sec. D.l; Comments of
           YWC/Ad+Soil on the Board Conference, Exhibit 2 [Affidavit of John A. O'Neal,
           Attachment 1]).~ That MTI did not consider a landfill as an acceptable and widely-used
           disposal technology does not change that fact.W



                HiIn some cases, the Comptroller General will consider a timely protest by a party that is not next in
           line for award. However, those cases generally involve claims of defects in the solicitation itself; so that if
           the protest was sustained, the solicitation might be cancelled and reissued. State Technical Institute at
           Memphis, supra. See also General Electrodynamics Corporation, B·221347.2; B.221347.3, May 13, 1986, 86·
           1 CPD "1454 (where GAO entertained a protest by a third low offeror because it made allegations that it
           had been misled, and consequently, it could not compete on an equal basis.).

               l.,!/Section 5.3.4 of Attachment 1, "Use and Disposal of Municipal Wastewater Sludge", states, with
           respect to "storage":

                   Storage space to accommodate at least several days' or more production of sludge should
                   be provided at the treatment plant and elsewhere in case transportation or labor problems
                   prevent hauling sludge to the landfill site. On·site storage is also desirable in case
                   inclement weather or other problems disrupt site operations.... (emphasis added).

           Nothing in this description of storage in any way suggests that it is a substitute method for use or disposal
           of sludge; and in view of the information provided by the parties on wastewater treatment and management
           technology, protestor has failed to persuade the Board otherwise. In essence, YWC offered disposal only
           during inclement weather, not disposal "in lieu of" storage.

               16/The Board agrees with the government and intervenors that to the extent the protest concerns a
           perceived ambiguity in the specifications regarding "storage" for purposes of later utilization or disposal
           versus direct disposal in a landfill or other facility during inclement weather, the protest is untimely. See

                   As stated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit:
                   ... The Board must exercise its authority to determine which parties are
                   sufficiently 'interested' to have standing before entertaining a potentially

           United States v. International Business Machines Corp., supra, at 1012. That we have
           done. As a result, because the protestor would not be next in line for award if this protest
           was sustained, and because the protestor did not timely challenge the solicitation, the
           evaluation of otTers or the responsiveness of the second low otTer, it is not a sufficiently
           "aggrieved party" for the purpose of this Board's jurisdiction.

                  Therefore, based upon all of the facts and circumstances and the authorities cited
