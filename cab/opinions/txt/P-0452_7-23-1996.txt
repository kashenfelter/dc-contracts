                                            OPINION

         Fort Myer Construction Corporation has filed a protest of Department of Public Works·
Invitation No. 93-01 15-AA-2-0-KA , alleging that the low. bid of Southern Maryland Restoration,
Inc. ("SMR"), is nonresponsive because of a defect in SMR's bid bond, namely, that SMR's
corporate secretary failed to execute a "Certificate as to Corporation" included on the bid bond.
The District has moved to dismiss the protest on the ground that Fort Myer initially misfiled its
protest with the contracting officer and by the time the protest was refiled with the Board, the
statutory lO-working-day filing deadline had passed. On the merits, the District argues that the
bid bond of SMR is not defective notwithstanding the unexecuted certificate becauseSMR's
surety properly executed the bid bond thereby legally obligating itself to pay should SMR fail
to fulfill its obligations. With regard to the jurisdictional issue of timely filing of a protest, we
hold that the protester's misfiling of the protest with the contracting officer within the statutory
time period was the functional equivalent of filing the protest with the Board, and we overrule
our prior decisions holding to the contrary. On the merits, we agree with the District that the
bid bond was not defective. Accordingly, we deny the protest.

                                             FACTS

       On February 20, 1996, the Department of Public Works ("DPW") issued IFB No. 93-
0115-AA-2-0-KA in the open market for the FY-94 1st Federal Aid Resurfacing Contract.
(Agency Report (" AR") at I). The solicitation contains a "Bid Bond for Construction" Form
No. DC 2640-5. The instructions on page "c" of the bid bond form set forth the requirements
for execution of the bid bond. Instruction Nos. 2 and 4 provide in relevant part:

       2.      Corporation's name should appear exactly as it does on Corporate Seal
               and inserted in the space designated "Principal" on the face of this form.
               If practicable, bond should be signed by President or Vice President; if
               signed by other official, evidence of authority must be furnished. Such
                                               -2-           Fort Myer Construction Corp., CAB No. P-452

               evidence should be in the form of an Extract of Minutes of a Meeting of
               the Board of Directors, or Extract of Bylaws, certified by the Corporate
               Secretary, or Assistance [sic] Secretary and Corporate Seal affixed
               thereto. CERTIFICATE AS TO CORPORATION must be executed by
               Corporate Secretary, or Assistant Secretary.

       4.      Corporations executing the bond shall affix their corporate seals.
               Individuals shall sign full first name, middle initial and last name opposite
               the word "seal"; two witnesses must be supplied, and their addresses,
               under the word" attest" . . . .

       Paragraph 10 of the solicitation's Special Provisions, entitled "PROTESTS", states:

       Any aggrieved person may protest this solicitation, award or proposed contract
       award. The protest shall be filed, in writing, with the Contract Appeals Board
       within ten (10) calendar days after the basis of the protest is known. The address
       of the Contract Appeals Board is 717 14th Street, N.W., Suite 430, Washington,
       D.C. 20005. The aggrieved person shall also mail a copy of the protest to the
       Contracting Officer.

Paragraph 10 incorrectly states that protests must be filed within 10 calendar days. It should
read 10 working days. D.C. Code § 1-1189.8(b).

      DPW opened bids on April 5, 1996, and determined that SMR submitted the low bid of
$777,245.50, followed by Fort Myer as next low bidder. (AR at 2). The contract has not been
awarded.

        SMR's bid is signed by its vice president, Mr. Stephen W. Fye, and is accompanied by
a corporate attestation. The bid form references an enclosed bid guaranty in the amount of 5
percent of the total amount bid. The bid bond attached to SMR's bid is dated March 25, 1996.
The bid bond's "Surety" block is properly completed and contains the signature of an authorized
representative of the surety. The bid bond references the correct IFB by number, contains
SMR's name and address as principal, and is signed by the same SMR vice president who signed
the bid, including a corporate attestation and the corporate seal. The block on the bid bond
labeled "Certificate as to Corporation" is complete with typewritten information, except that the
line calling for the signature of the corporate secretary is blank.

        On April 8, 1996, Fort Myer submitted a 5-page letter addressed to DPW's contracting
officer, entitled "PROTEST", arguing that SMR's bid was nonresponsive on account of a
defective bid bond. In an April 17, 1996 letter, received by Fort Myer on April 23, 1996,
DPW's contracting officer acknowledged receipt of the April 8 protest letter and advised Fort
Myer that "[a]ll protests are to be filed with the District of Columbia Contract Appeals Board

      " Fort Myer refiled the identical protest with the Board on April 24, 1996}

       On May 21, 1996, the District filed a Motion to Dismiss the protest as untimely. The
District's motion to dismiss included as exhibits the solicitation (Exhibit 1), the bid tabulation
(Exhibit 2), and Fort Myer's April 8, 1996 protest letter to the DPW contracting officer (Exhibit
3). Fort Myer submitted an opposition to the motion to dismiss on May 30, 1996. On June 14,
1996, we ordered the District to file an Agency Report to address the merits of the protest. On
June 25, 1996, the District filed its Agency Report. Additional exhibits attached to the Agency
Report included SMR's bid (Exhibit 4), SMR's bid bond (Exhibit 5), a blank bid bond Form No.
DC 2640-5 (Exhibit 6). On July 10, 1996, Fort Myer filed a response to the Agency Report.
SMR as intervenor has filed comments in support of the District's motion to dismiss and· the
Agency Report.

                                         DISCUSSION

I.     Jurisdiction

       We first address the District's motion to dismiss because it raises the threshold question
of Board jurisdiction. The Board's primary jurisdiction-granting provision of the Procurement
Practices Act, D.C. Code § 1-1189.3 (1992), states with regard to protest jurisdiction:

               The Board shall be the exclusive hearing tribunal for, and shall
               have jurisdiction to review and determine de novo:

               (1)      Any protest of a solicitation or award of a contract
               addressed to the Board by any actual or prospective bidder or
               offeror, or a contractor who is aggrieved in connection with the
               solicitation or award of a contract.

Section 1-1189.8(b) of the D.C. Code requires that a person aggrieved by a solicitation or award
"shall file a protest with the Board within 10 working days after the aggrieved person knew or
should have known of the facts and circumstances upon which the protest is based." The 1O-day
filing requirement is a prerequisite to Board jurisdiction and cannot be waived. Consolidated
Maintenance Supply, Inc.; CAB No. P-308, Oct. 2, 1992, 40 D.C. Reg. 4568, 4569.

        The District correctly states that in a number of cases we have dismissed protests as
untimely, holding that misfiling a protest with the contracting officer does not constitute timely
filing with the Board. E.g., Xerox Corp., CAB No. P-125, Feb. 15, 1991,38 D.C. Reg. 3234,
3235; D.H. Kim Enterprises, Inc., CAB No P-293, Dec. 12,1991,39 D.C. Reg. 4365,4366;
J.G. Robinson Heating & Air Conditioning, CAB No. P-337, Oct. 8, 1992,40 D.C. Reg. 4572,
4573; M&T Electrical Contractors, Inc., CAB No. P-367, Aug. 10, 1993, 41 D.C. Reg. 3537.
In addition, our rules provide that protests "shall be filed with the Board" and that "[t]iling

April 8 protest letter and the response from DPW's contracting officer.
                                                -4-           Fort Myer Construction Corp., CAB No. P-452

occurs when the protest is received by the Board." Board Rules 301.1 and 301.3, 36 D.C. Reg.
2710. Nonetheless, for the reasons discussed below, we conclude that a protest filed with the
contracting officer within the statutory 1O-day time period is functionally equivalent to filing
with the Board. To the extent that our prior decisions have held otherwise, we overrule those
holdings.

        We start with the principle that courts and boards should decide cases, wherever possible,
on the merits rather than on procedural technicalities. Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487
U.S. 312, 316-17 (1988) ("the requirements of the rules of procedure should be liberally
construed and ... 'mere technicalities' should not stand in the way of consideration of a case
on its merits"); Anderson v. District of Columbia, 72 F.3d 166, 168 (D.C. Cir. 1995). At the
same time, the Board's jurisdictional scope is limited to that conferred by statute. The question
is whether the Council of the District of Columbia intended -- by stating in sections 1-1189.3(1)
and 1-1189.8(b) that protests be "addressed to" and "filed with" the Board -- to exclude our
treating an otherwise proper protest timely filed with the contracting officer as tantamount to
filing with the Board. We believe the better interpretation is that the Council did not intend to
foreclose our treating such a protest as timely filed with the Board for purposes of jurisdiction.
As a statutory rule of construction, the Procurement Practices Act "shall be liberally construed
and applied to promote its underlying purposes and policies." D.C. Code § 1-1181.1(a).
Treating an otherwise proper protest directed to the contracting officer within the 1O-working-
day statutory period as functionally equivalent to filing with the Board, and resolving the protest
on its merits, promotes fair and equitable treatment of all participants while safeguarding and
maintaining a procurement system of quality and integrity.

         Our interpretation neither minimizes nor defeats the very clear legislative purpose for the
 10-working-day filing requirement. The Council intended to require prompt filing of protests
so that the Board could "promptly decide" protests and avoid any undue disruption of District
agency procurements. Treating a protest filed with the contracting officer as tantamount to filing
with the Board for purposes of timeliness will not prevent the Board from meeting its obligation
to resolve protests expeditiously. We can hardly imagine a situation where the contracting
officer, upon receiving what is obviously a protest, would be unable to furnish the protest to the
Board within a day of agency receipt. Moreover, our treatment of a protest misfiled with the
contracting officer will not cause prejudice to the District. The Board's rules require the Board
promptly to docket and forward an acknowledgement of the protest to the contracting agency and
its legal counsel. Board Rules 303.1-303.3. The contracting agency is responsible for preparing
and submitting the Agency Report within 25 days of receipt of the Board's acknowledgement.
Thus, in the case of a protest misfiled with the contracting officer, the agency still would have
25 days from the date of receiving the Board's acknowledgement to file the Agency Report.
Using actual notice of the protest as the measure, the contracting officer has more time to file
the Agency Report where the protester misfiles than where it initially files only at the Board.
Even in a case where the protester is successful on the merits before the Board, any prejudice
caused by a brief delay arising from the protester's misfiling, through no fault of the agency in
forwarding the protest to the Board, will work against the protester, not the agency, when the
Board fashions a remedy. See D.C. Code § 1-1189.8(e); Board Rules 314.1-314.3.

       There are two lines of precedent which support our reasoning, one concerning the
                                                      -5-           ForI Myer Construclion Corp., CAB No. P-452

     specificity requirements for notices of appeal in federal appellate practice and the other
     concerning notices of appeal filed with federal boards of contract appeals from contracting
     officers' final decisions on claims.

             Rule 3(c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure2 specifies the required content of
     a notice of appeal to federal appellate courts. In construing the" specificity requirement" of Rule
     3(c), which is jurisdictional, courts have held that improperly designating the wrong appellate
     tribunal in the notice of appeal filed in the lower tribunal does not by itself constitute a
     jurisdictional defect requiring dismissal. E.g., Anderson v. District of Columbia, 72 F.3d at
      168; United States v. Musa, 946 F.2d 1297, 1301 (7th Cir. 1991). Central to the specificity
     requirements for notices of appeal under Rule 3(c) is the principle of fair notice to the opposing
     party and to the court. Torres, 487 U.S. at 318; Anderson, 72 F.3d at 168; Musa, 946 F.2d at
      1301. In Anderson and Musa, the appellant's naming the wrong appellate court in his notice of
     appeal did not render the notice jurisdictionally defective because the notice unambiguously
     informed the appellee and the district court what judgment or order appellant was appealing and
     the court of appeals was the only court to which an appeal c.ould ~e taken. Accord, McLemore
"'   v. Landry, 898 F.2d 996, 999 (5th Cir.), cen. denied, 498 U.S. 966 (1990) (appellant's failure
     to designate any circuit in the notice of appeal not a bar to jurisdiction because the Fifth Circuit
     was the only court to which an appeal could be taken).

            Section 7 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. § 606 (1994),3 specifies the
     requirements for a contractor to file an appeal to a federal board of contract appeals from a final
     decision of an agency contracting officer. In construing the 90-day statutory filing requirement,
     also jurisdictional, the federal boards have routinely treated an otherwise proper appeal
     misdirected to the contracting officer within the required time period as tantamount to filing an
     appeal with the board. E.g., Yankee Telecommunication Labs., Inc., ASBCA No. 25240, 82-1
     BCA 1 15,515; Orbas & Assocs., ASBCA No. 30201, 85-1 BCA 1 17,915 at 89,720; Inventory


     2   Rule 3(c) provides:

              A notice of appeal shall specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming
              each appellant in either the caption or the body of the notice of appeal. . .. A
              notice of appeal also must designate the judgment, \order, or part thereof appealed
              from, and must name the court to which the appeal is taken. An appeal will not
              be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal, or for failure
              to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice. . . .

     3 41 U.S.c. § 606 provides:

             Within ninety days from the date of receipt of a contracting officer's decision
             under section 605 of this title, the contractor may appeal such decision to an
             agency board of contract appeals, as provided in section 607 of this title.

         Section 607 does not supply any additional pertinent requirements concerning the actual filing
         of a notice of appeal.
                                                                    e-

Accounting Service, ENG BCA No. 5797, 93-1 BCA 1 25,230 at 125,671; Contraves-Goerz
Corp., ASBCA No. 26317,83-1 BCA 1 16,309; Dawson Constr. Co., EBCA No. 155-2-81,
81-2 BCA 1 15,162. A contracting officer's failure to forward the notice of appeal to the board
does not defeat the board's jurisdiction. Yankee Telecommunications, 82-1 BCA at 76,962-63;
Inventory Accounting Service, 93-1 BCA at 125,671.

        Based on the circumstances presented in the record, we conclude that Fort Myer's filing
of its protest with the contracting officer was functionally equivalent to filing the protest with
this Board and that we should not dismiss the protest as untimely. Fort Myer's letter was
unambiguously a protest from the standpoint of form and content. It was filed the first working
day after bids were opened and it challenged the responsiveness of the apparent low bid. When
Fort Myer delivered its protest to the contracting officer, it certainly provided fair notice to the
appellee, the District of Columbia, and to the agency through the person of the contracting
officer. From the record, there can be no ambiguity that the protester intended to file a protest.
The Procurement Practices Act vests only this Board with jurisdiction over protests from
agencies subordinate to the Mayor. See D. C. Code § 1-1181. 4(c). Thus, there is no issue as
to whether the protester intended an agency protest or a Board protest. q: The Miklin Group,
Inc., GSBCA No. 9322-P, Jan. 20, 1988,88-1 BCA 120,516 at 103,712-13.

        Because we deem Fort Myer's protest filing with the contracting officer within the 10-
working-day time period functionally equivalent to filing with the Board, the fact that the
protester did not receive notice from the contracting officer of the misfiling until one day after
expiration of the lO-working-day period will not defeat Board jurisdiction. In the future, when
the contracting officer receives a misdirected protest, the contracting officer shall immediately
forward the protest to the Board.

II.    Merits

        On the merits of Fort Myer's protest, we agree with the District that SMR's bid is not
rendered nonresponsive simply because SMR's corporate secretary failed to execute a
"Certificate as to Corporation" on the bid bond.

        Bid bond requirements are a material part of the IFB, and a contracting officer cannot
waive a failure to comply with a bond provision. Design For Health, Inc., 69 Compo Gen. 712,
714 (1990), 90-2 CPD 1213. The sufficiency of a bid bond depends on whether the surety is
clearly bound by its terms and whether the government will receive the full and complete
protection it contemplated in the event the bidder fails to execute the required contract
documents and deliver the required performance and payment bonds. Webb Builders Hardware,
Inc., B-185985, May 27, 1976, 76-1 CPD 1 348; Martina Enterprises, B-250766, Oct. 21,
1992, 92-2 CPD 1266. Among other things, the terms of the bid bond must clearly establish
the liability of the surety at the time of bid opening. Design/or Health, 69 Compo Gen. at 714.
When the surety's liability is not clear, the bond is defective. This rule is prompted by the law
of suretyship that no one incurs a liability to pay the debts of another unless he expressly agrees
to be bound. Martina Enterprises, 92-2 CPD 1 266; G&C Enterprises, Inc., B-233537, Feb.
15, 1989, 89-1 CPD 1 163.
                                                -7-            Fort Myer Construction Corp., CAB No. P-452

        Here, SMR's vice president properly executed the bid, he signed the bid bond, the bond
properly identified the IFB to which it was applicable, the appropriate penal amount was
indicated, and the bond was properly signed by the surety. Under these circumstances, the
failure of SMR's corporate secretary to execute the certificate as to corporation could not relieve
the surety of its obligation under the bond. This Board and the Comptroller General have held
that the surety's obligation, and thus the validity of the bid bond, were not affected even where
the principal did not sign the bond at all. E.g., Norair Engineering Corp., CAB No. P-302,
Oct. 21, 1992,40 D.C. Reg~ 4636; Southern Maryland Restoration, Inc., CAB No. P-241 , Aug.
7, 1991, 39 D.C. Reg. 4268; Webb Builders Hardware, 76-1 CPD 1 348; General Ship &
Engine Works, Inc., B-184831, 55 Compo Gen. 422, 426 (1975), 75-2 CPD 1 269. In Webb
Builders, the protester challenged another bidder's failure to execute a "certificate as to
corporation" on the same bid bond Form No. DC 2640-5 used in the present solicitation. The
Comptroller General effectively rejected the challenge on the ground that a defective signature
was immaterial because a bid bond unsigned by the bidder does not render the bond invalid if
the bond is otherwise in order. In our Norair Engineering and Southern Maryland Restoration
decisions, we also rejected the argument that a bid bond was defective simply because the
corporate secretary failed to sign the bid bond. 4                                       .


                                          CONCLUSION

        Because SMR presented a bid bond properly executed by the surety, and the bond
references the IJ:B and identifies the correct penal amount, the fact that the corporate secretary
failed to execute the "certificate as to corporation" is a minor informality. The District will
receive the full and complete protection it contemplated in the event SMR fails to execute the
required contract documents and deliver the required performance and payment bonds.

        Accordingly, the protest is denied.

        SO ORDERED.

 4 We find no merit in Fort Myer's attempt to avoid the force of these cases by arguing that the
 certificate as to corporation was necessary in light of a typographical error in the portion of the
 printed bid form where the bidder agrees to furnish executed contract documents and
 performance and payment bonds with good and sufficient "survey" -- rather than "surety." This
 error does not vitiate the surety's obligation. The very next clause states that if the bidder fails
 to satisfy these obligations, "required bid guaranty shall be applied as specified in Instructions
 to Bidders." Several lines down on the bid form, the bidder also expressly incorporates its "bid
.guaranty consisting of 5% of the total amount bid" in the form of a bid bond.
