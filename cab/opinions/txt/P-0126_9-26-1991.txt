                                               OPINION

       This protest by CapitolCare Incorporated, (CCI, Protestor), challenges the award
of a contract to provide electronic monitoring devices for the Department of Corrections'
work release and home detention program to the Hitek Community Control Corporation
(Hitek).

       CCI argues that Hitek, a Florida-based corporation, is incapable of providing
services within the metropolitan area of Washington, D.C. and, further, that Hitek's bid
was nonresponsive to the technical specifications of the IFB in the following respects:

      1.     The transmitter for monitoring movements of the participants in the
             home security program does not meet the requirements of the IFB;

      2.     The receiver/dialer equipment fails the technical specifications, as
             does the control computer, and

      3.     liitt:rl.   (.antlOt   perform as required by the IFB.

      The District submits that CCl's protest raises the issue of whether the
government properly evaluated Hitek's bid. Each of CCl's individual issues is analyzed
and answered.

      CCI did not respond to the Agency Report.

       We have carefully considered each issue raised by CCI and the District's response
thereto. Under our rules, a protestor has the burden of establishing its case by a
                                           _ 2: -      CAPITOLCARE INCORPORATION, CAB No. P.126


preponderance of the evidence. In this matter, the District refuted each allegation
effectively. The failure of CCI to reply to the Agency Report and provide evidence to
substantiate its claims, or to contest the District's defenses, has resulted in a failure to
meet its burden of proof.

        The protest is DENIED.
