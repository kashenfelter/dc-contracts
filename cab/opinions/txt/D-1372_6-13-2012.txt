                  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CONTRACT APPEALS BOARD

APPEAL OF:

GATEKEEPERS INTERNET MARKETING, INC.                                             )
                                                                                 )
Under Contract Nos. PODS-2003-C-615-04                                           )        CAB No. D-1372
                    PODS-2003-C-920-27                                           )
                    PODS-2003-C-037-02                                           )

                                  ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS
                                        Filing ID 44793107

       Before the Board is the District’s motion to dismiss the present action based on the
following grounds: (1) the Appellant failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted;
and (2) this appeal is barred by the statute of limitations. (Mot. to Dismiss 1.) 1 The Appellant
opposes the District’s request for dismissal. (Appellant’s Resp. to District’s Mot. to Dismiss 1.)

        By way of background, the Appellant contracted with the District to provide information
technology services under Contract Nos. PODS-2003-C-615-04, PODS-2003-C-920-27, and
PODS-2003-C-037-02. (Revised Joint Prehearing Statement 1.) Appellant provided services to
the District from December 2004 to September 2008. (Id. at 2.) The Appellant alleges that the
District failed to pay its company for goods and services accepted by the District during this time
period. (Id. at 1.) The parties concur that the Appellant submitted a contract claim to the
Contracting Officer (“CO”) against the District arising from the aforementioned contracts, and
that the CO issued a final decision denying the claim on June 20, 2009. (Id. at 2-3.) It is also
undisputed that, on November 19, 2009, Appellant filed the present action with the Board to
appeal the CO’s June 20, 2009, final decision. (Id. at 3.)

         Based upon the foregoing facts, the District asserts that the Board does not have
jurisdiction to hear the present appeal because it is barred by the 90 day statute of limitations
period applicable to contractor claims against the District after the CO’s final decision is issued,
as set forth under D.C. CODE § 2-360.04(a) (2011). (District’s Mot. to Dismiss 3-4.) The
Appellant, on the other hand, does not deny the applicability of a statutory period within which
an appeal of a claim must be filed with the Board, but rather seemingly requests that the Board
retain jurisdiction of this matter because, after receiving the CO’s final decision, the Appellant
allegedly expended additional time attempting to negotiate a settlement with the District before
filing its appeal with the Board. (Appellant’s Resp. to District’s Mot. to Dismiss 1.)

        Upon consideration of the District’s motion to dismiss, the Appellant’s response, and the
entire record, the Board finds that the Appellant’s appeal is time barred. The statute discussed
herein expressly provides that a contractor seeking to appeal a CO’s final decision on a contract
claim has a period of 90 days within which it may file such an action with the Board after the

1
  The Board’s June 1, 2012, Prehearing Order instructed the District to file a motion to dismiss regarding the present
statute of limitations ground, and ordered the Appellant to file a response thereto, based upon the District’s
representation during the parties’ May 24, 2012, prehearing conference that this present action is time barred.
                                                             -2-             GATEKEEPERS INTERNET MARKETING, INC.
                                                                                                   CAB NO. D-1372

contractor receives the CO’s final decision on its claim. D.C. CODE § 2-360.04(a) (2011). 2 The
Board has expressly recognized this 90 day period as a statutory time limitation within which an
appeal must be filed with the Board. E.g., Claim of Chief Procurement Officer, CAB No. D-
1182, 50 D.C. Reg. 7465 (Nov. 29, 2002) (articulating the same 90 day statute of limitation
period for filing claims with the Board after receipt of the contracting officer’s final decision,
under former D.C. CODE § 2-309.04(a)).

        In the present action, the CO issued a final decision on June 20, 2009, and the Appellant
filed a complaint with the Board on November 19, 2009, which was 152 days after the CO’s
final decision was issued. Therefore, the Appellant’s appeal was filed well beyond the 90 day
statute of limitations period set forth in D.C. CODE § 2-360.04(a), and, consequently, the Board
lacks jurisdiction to decide this appeal.

        Additionally, as the second basis for requesting dismissal of this matter, the District
asserts that the Appellant’s action should be dismissed because it fails to state a claim pursuant to
Rule 12(b)(6) of the D.C. Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. (District’s Mot. to Dismiss
1.) However, having found that the Board cannot exercise jurisdiction over this appeal because
of the statute of limitations applicable to a contractor’s right of appeal to the Board, we find it
unnecessary to address this secondary issue as an alternative basis for dismissal.

       For the foregoing reasons, the District’s motion is granted, in part, and the present action
is dismissed with prejudice.

SO ORDERED.
