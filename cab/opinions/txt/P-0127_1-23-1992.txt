                                          OPINION

           This protest was filed by Nash/Boyd on September 13, 1988, challenging award of
    the above-captioned contract for sand, cement, crushed stone and miscellaneous
    construction supplies by the Department of Administrative Services (DAS). The stated
    basis of the protest as set forth in the one-page letter from Protestor is as follows:

          "BASIS OF PROTEST:         IMPROPER, UNTIMELY, IRREGULAR PRO-
                                     CEDURES USED BY DAS IN AWARDING

              RESPONSES:

                     "THE CONTRACT PROBABLY ISN'T WORTH PURSUING;
                     THERE IS NO STANDING IN LINE TO BID THIS ONE.
                     AGENCIES [sic] ESTIMATES OF THEIR NEEDS ARE
                     PROBABLY INACCURATE".

                                                       AN AGENCY SUPERVISOR

Protestor requests relief of $50,000.00.

       On November 4, 1989, the District moved for partial dismissal of the protest, or
in the alternative, for a more definite statement. The motion requests partial dismissal,
asserting that Nash/Boyd failed to include in its protest a clear and concise statement of
the legal and factual grounds of two of the allegations of the protest. In the first
instance, the District challenges that Nash/Boyd merely states that, "conflicting
information was given about items awarded." The District asserts that Nash/Boyd does
not adequately describe the conflicting information so as to allow the District to respond
to the allegations. According to the District, Nash/Boyd fails to state the specific
conflicting information that was given about the items awarded and fails to state who
provided the conflicting information.

       In the second instance, the District asserts that Nash/Boyd a lleges that an agency
supervisor informed Nash/Boyd that "the contract probably isn't worth pursuing; there is
no standing in line to bid this one. Agencies estimates of their needs are probably
inaccurate." The District argues that Nash/Boyd has failed to provide sufficient
information concerning the agency involved or the identity of the agency supervisor to
allow the District to respond to the allegation.

       Protestor has not responded to the motion for partial di smi ssal.

       The agency report was subsequently filed on November 7, 1988. The report states
that the Invitation for Bids (IFB) was issued on April 8, 1988, and that bids were
opened on May 12, 1988. Two bidders responded to the IFB, Ideal and Nash/Boyd. The
report further states that (1) the District properly made the bid tabulation sheets
•

                                               -3 -

    accessible to Nash/Boyd; (2) the bid tabulation sheets support an award in the a mount
    of $359,850 to Ideal; (3) the award of contract no. 82l8-AA-56-0-8-HS was timely despite
    the delay from bid opening to the date of award; (4) the Director of DAS does not recall
    informing Nash/Boyd that the contract could not be awarded while there was a pending
    protest; (5) the District acted properly in requesting responsibility information from
    Nash/Boyd after the District awarded contract no. 82l8-AA-56-0-8-HS to Ideal; and (6)
    the relief requested by Nash/Boyd is not appropriate.

            Protestor also has not responded to the agency report.

           Board Rule 307.1 allows protestors seven days within which to respond to the
    District's agency report or dispositive motion, 36 DCR 2713. Board Rule 3073 provides
    that failure of the protestor to file comments or request an extension of time for filing
    will result in closing the record and may result in dismissal of the protest. Board Rule
    307.4 provides that when a protestor fails to file comments on an agency report, the
    factual allegations that are not admitted in the agency report, or otherwise corroborated
    on the record may be disregarded.

           Based on the record before the Board, the protest is DENIED as lacking in merit
    in part, and DISMISSED in part for failing to set forth a clear and concise statement of
    the legal and factual grounds supporting the protest.
