                                             OPINION

        Recently, we sustained a protest of The Answer Temps, Inc. ("TAT") challenging an emergency,
sole source award by the District of Columbia Public Schools ("DCPS") to Horton and Barber
Professional Services, Inc. ("H&B") for transportationof special education students. The Answer Temps,
Inc., CAB Nos. P-564, P-567, Jan. 28, 1999, 10 P.D. 7651. TAT now challenges another DCPS
emergency, sole source contract award to H&B for the period January 29 through February 27, 1999.
The District claims that the latest sole source award is justified by emergency conditions and that
competition was not practicable based on a DCPS survey in December 1998 which purports to show that
no entity other than H&B could meet DCPS's short-term requirements.

        We conclude that DCPS has not justified an emergency award under D.C. Code § 1-1183.12
because this unfortunate, last minute award resulted from inadequate advance procurement plmming and
improper handling ofthe procuremel).t by DCPS and the Office oftIle Chief Procurement Officer ("CPO").
In addition, neither the CPO's detJrmination and findings nor DCPS' s survey rationally support the
decision to award a sole source contract to H&B without obtaining at least some competition :liom other
bidders such as TAT. The District has failed to submit adequate evidence demons~rating that only H&B
could provide bus drivers and attendants for DCPS' s short-term requirements. At the Board's suggestion,
the District conducted a new emergency procurement for the short-term requirements and received four
competitive bids. This fact further shows that adequate competition was possible.

        Accordingly, we sustain the protest. The District shall promptly terminate Contract No. DCPS-C-
99018-4789-0T and make an award to the low, responsible bidder under the recent competitive
solicitation, DCPS-E-99018-0T.

                                            BACKGROUND

         A detailed statement of facts concerning DCPS' s procurement effOlis during the second half of
1998 for bus drivers and attendants for special education students is set forth in our recent protest decision
in CAB Nos. P-564 andP-567. See 10 P.D. at 7651-54. For the present case, the following summary
is sufficient.

         DCPS requires a minimum of 15 0 contractor-supplied bus drivers and attendants for transportation
of special education school children. TAT had a contract with DCPS, which expired on September 30,
1998, for providing bus drivers and attendants. Prior to expiration of that contract, DCPS solicited a
successor long-telm contract through sealed bids. Shortly before TAT's contract was to expire, the CPO
cancelled the solicitation due to specification deficiencies. On September 28, 1998, DCPS entered into
a letter contract with H&B (the low bidder on the cancelled solicitation) to provide bus drivers and
attendants tlu'ough October 31, 1998. DCPS' s stated intent was to assure temporary driver and attendant
services for the special education students pending a resolicitation for a long-tenn contract. Because the
emergency contract had a legal limit of 120 days, the DCPS contracting officer and the CPO knew that
a resolicitation for DCPS' s long-term requirements had to be done promptly in order to meet a
performance start date of no later than February 1, 1999. Unfortunately, a new solicitation for these critical
services was not promptly issued in October 1998. One District employee states that he was assigned to
work on the resolicitation in early November 1998. (AREx. 6 (PiumloAff. ~ 1)). ADCPS supervisory
contract specialist was also assigned to work on the solicitation in early December 1998. CAR Ex. 2
(Hatcher Aff. ~~ 1-2)). At some point in either December 1998 or January 1999, the Deputy CPO
decided that it was necessary to change the fonn of the solicitation from sealed bidding to sealed proposals.
(Id. ~ 3). The solicitation for the long-term requirements was not issued until January 22, 1999. In the
meantinle, DCPS extended what was essentially a sole source letter contract through November 1998, then
through December 1998, and finally through January 28, 1999.

       On the day the letter contract expired, January 28, 1999, the CPO awarded a new sole source,
emergency contract to H&B for a minimum of 150 and a maximum of230 bus drivers and attendants for
the period January 29, 1999, through February 27, 1999. The award was accompanied by a
Detemlination and Finding for an Emergency Contract, dated January 29, 1999. The D&F states that the
decision not to solicit competitio~ is supported by a market survey:

        During December 1998, a market survey was conducted to determine if there were any
        companies who could provide bus drivers and attendants who could begin work
        inunediately and meet DCPS' s progranlmatic requirements. It was discovered that there
        were no companies available that could inunediately supply drivers and attendants to meet
        DCPS's requirements for drug and alcohol testing, CDL drivers' license, DCPS bus
        driver's license "face card", FBI background checks, medical examinations, and training.

(AR Ex. 1, D&F at 2). In the D&F, the CPO added that no firm other than H&B could be awarded a
contract and "immediately perform the services required .... " (Id.). Although no written record of the
                                                                                                                [7673]

                                                                                      I
December 1998 survey exists (AR Ex. 3 (Fitzgerald Aff. ~ 1)), the District included tn the Agency Report
affidavits from Ms. Kathy Hatcher, the PCPS supervisory contract specialist, l and Mt.   John Piunno, whose
position within the District government is not made clear in the record. In her affidaiit, Ms. Hatcher states
with regard to the survey:                                                            i

         4. I had to determine whether a contractor that specialized in providing tJansportation
         services could provide school bus transportation services on an emergedcy basis for a
         short period of time until a new long-term contract was awarded. I learne~ from Kevin
         West, Chief ofthe Transportation Division, DCPS, that there were two nati~nally known
         contractors that specialized in these services: Laidlaw Transportation Incl. ("LTI") and
         Ryder Company. This was subsequently confirmed by a search       ,
                                                                             on th~i Internet.

         5. On or about December 16, 1998, I spoke to a representative ofLTI. I dttermined the
         following:                                                                '
         a. LTI would require a transition period of four to six weeks to adequatelt test, certify,
         train, and perform FBI background investigations.                         I
         b. LTI would not commit to delivering required services within 24 hours, since they
         indicated that even the incumbent contractor's employees would need to'be lappropriately
         qualified to perform.                                                     I

                                                                                      I
         d. LTI would not participate in a competitive emergency procurement fo~ the required
         transportation requirements on a short-term basis (120 days).         I


         6. I considered that the response from LTI was representative of the r1sponse that I
         would have received from Ryder and other contractors that specialized in 'transportation
         services. I did not contact Answer Temps ~ince this is a company that ~pecializes in
         providing temporary personnel services and the District determined that th9 requirements
         were for specialized transportation services.                              I




       In an effort to support the CPO's D&F for a sole source contract to H&~, the Deputy CPO for
Public Safety and Education states in an affidavit:                           I
                                     ~                                                i
                                      ~                                               I
         Based on the limited available information, the District believes there is rea~onable doubt
         that The Answer Temps ("TAT") and Horton and Barber Professional ~ervices, Inc,
         ("H&B") are not qualified and specialized providers in transportation Iservices.
                                                                   ,                  I
                                                                                      I
(AREx. 3, Fitzgerald Aff. ~ 3). Notwithstanding the ambiguities in this statementJ the Deputy CPO also
states that "in the interim, H&B was satisfactorily performing and capable of contintjing to provide services
with minimal disruption to the special education children." (Id. ~ 7). Currently, H~ is providing 216 bus
drivers and213 attendants, each of whom meets all contract requirements. (ARlat 5-6; ARExs. 4-5).
                                                                   "                  I

                                                                                      I

        TAT has filed an affidavit and supporting documents indicating that it is capable of providing bus
drivers and attendants meeting all of the contract requirements. (Declaration of Allene Graves, filed
February 8, 1999).

        TAT filed its protest of the new sole source, emergency contract on J anuary29, 1999. The Board
held a conference with the parties and issued an order on February 1, 1999, indicating inter alia that the
CPO and DCPS should issue a competitive, emergency solicitation for short-term driver and attendant
services in order to avoid disruption of the services should the Board sustain the protest on the ground that
the January 28 sole source award was improper. We have been advised that the CPO and DCPS issued
an emergency solicitation, DCPS-E-990 IS-OT, that four firms (McLean TranspOliation Service, Inc.,
H&B, C. Price & Associates, and TAT) responded to the solicitation, and that H&B was the low bidder.
(TAT filing of February 16, 1999; District tiling of February 17, 1999).2

                                              DISCUSSION

        We exercise protest jurisdiction pursuantto D.C. Code § 1-1189.3 (Supp. 1998).

         The first issue presented by the protest is whether the DCPS and the CPO properly determined
that the circumstances justified an emergency procurement when the thrice-extended letter contract expired
January 28, 1999. We conclude that a valid emergency, as defined by D.C. Code § 1-1183.12 and 27
DCMR § 1710, did not exist. DCPS and the CPO knew long before January 28, 1999, that they would
need another short-term contract to bridge between the January 28, 1999 expiration ofH&B' s letter
contract and the commencement of performance by a contractor under the contract r~sulting :liOln the long-
ternl solicitation. When the re-issuance of anew long-term solicitation failed to occur in October 1998,
as planned, DCPS and the CPO knew or should have known that a timely long-term contract stllii (i. e.,
February 1, 1999) was injeopardy. Certainly by the beginning of November 1998, DCPS and the CPO
should have known that a short. .:tenn contract would be needed beyond January 28; 1999. DCPS and the
CPO also understood that any contractor who did not have current access to a pool of trained drivers and
attendants would need at least a month oftransition time to satisfY aU of the minimum requirements prior
to commencing perfOlmance. Thus, by the time that Mr. Piunno in early November ~ 998 llild Ms. Hatcher
in early December 1998 were conducting their "survey", DCPS and the CPO knew or should have known
that a short-tenn contract would be f~eeded to bridge the period from January 29, 1999, through the start
of performance under the long-termicontract whose solicitation was not issued until January 22, 1999.
Because the "emergency''' that was declared on Jllimary 28, 1999, was caused solely by poor procurement
planning by the responsible District contracting personnel, there was no legally justifiable emergency as that
ternl is defined by statute and regulation. It is dear from the facts that DCPS and the CPO had sufficient
time in October, November, and December 1998, to solicit competitive bids forits short-term needs, with


2H&B misfiled a protest ofthis new emergency solicitation with the DCPS contracting officer on February
16, 1999, which District counsel forwarded to the Board on February 17, 1999, and was docketed as
CAB No. P-573. H&B has withdrawn that protest apparently because it was the low bidder. (H&B filing
of February 17, 1999).
