                   OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS


         On April 29, 1994, Tricon of Washington, D.C., Inc . ("Protestor" or "Tricon") filed a
protest of the award of Contract No. DCPL 94-0001 to Drew Water Services for the District of
Columbia Public Library's ("District" or "DCPL") annual water treatment program.· Protestor
requests that the contract be declared void by the Board and that the Board award the contract
to Tricon in compliance with the provisions of IFB No. DCPL 94-0001. The Protestor alleges
that the contract was awarded in error because the DCPL: (I) made the award considering only
the bid price for the base year and not the combined bid price for the base year and two option
years as required by the bid specifications; and (2) failed to consider the fact that Protestor is
a certified small disadvantaged business and adjust its bid accordingly (i .e., grant Tricon a "5 %
preference for award").




    • The DCPL is an independent agency within the government of the District of Columbia.
D.C. Code §§ 37-101 through 37-110 (1990 Repl.) . As an independent agency, the DCPL is
exempt from the provisions of the Procurement Practices Act of 1985 ("PPA"). D.C. Code §
1-1181.4 (a), (b) (1992 Repl.).

       The Board and the DCPL executed an agreement on September 11, 1992 engaging the
Board "to hear and decide appeals from the Chief Procurement Officer's or Library's final
decision or failure to issue a timely decision on: (I) any protest by a party aggrieved in
connection with the solicitation or award of a contract by the Library; .. .. " This protest of an
action of an independent agency is properly before the Board pursuant to this agreement and to
Board Rule 101.8 , 36 DCR 2686 (April 21 , 1989) .

                                               -3-         CAB No. P-408, Tricon of Wash., D.C., Inc.



      4354.11          A protestor intending to file an appeal from the
                       CCO's decision shall file the appeal with the
                       Contracts Review Committee. The protestor must
                       appeal the CCO's decision within five (5) working
                       days after receipt of the CCO's decision.




       4354 . 13       The Contracts Review Committee shall issue a
                       written decision within forty-five (45) calendar days
                       after receipt of the filing of the appeal. Any failure
                       by the Contracts Review Committee to issue a
                       written decision within the forty-five (45) calendar
                       days shall be deemed to be a denial of the protest
                       and shall authorize the contractor to appeal the
                       protest to the Contract Appeals Board.




       4354.15         Each protestor intending to file an appeal of the
                       Contracts Review Committee's decision shall file an
                       appeal to the District of Columbia Contract Appeals
                       Board ('CAB'). In order for the CAB to consider
                       the appeal, the protestor shall file the appeal within
                       ten (10) working days after the protestor receives a
                       written decision from the Contracts Review
                       Committee.

       4354 . 16       The CAB shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear
                       and decide appeals from written decisions of the
                       Contracts Review Committee; provided, however,
                       that no appeal may be taken to the CAB unless and
                       until all administrative review procedures provided
                       for in this chapter have first been fully and properly
                       complied with and exhausted .

Id. at 7992 - 7993 .

         Protestor was notified by the CCO by a letter dated April 20, 1994 (received on April
28, 1994) that it had not been awarded Contract No. DCPL 94-001. Protest, Attachment 2.
Protestor filed its protest of the contract award with the Board on April 29, 1994. DCPL's ceo
is listed as having received a copy of the protest as filed .
                                                                                                      [5896]



                                                - 4 -       CAB No. P-408, Tricon o f   Wa~ h . ,   D.C. , Inc.



        The Board received a written response to Tricon's allegations directly from the CCO on
May I I, 1994. 2 Although the letter was addressed directly to the Board , there is an indication
that Tricon was sent a copy. The Board finds that the DCPL intended this letter to serve as the
CCO ' s official written response to the protest in accordance with 19 DCMR § 4354.2 (Id . at
7992).

        In his May 9, 1994 letter, the CCO stated the reasons for the award to Drew, rather than
Tricon , as follows : (J) the contract award was for the initial period only, with optional
extension(s);    (2) there was no provision in the IFB for a preference to Small and
Disadvantaged Businesses; (3) the DCPL has designated certain construction projects to meet
the goals of the Small Business Enterprise Set-Aside Program; (4) Drew Water Services was
the low bidder for the initial contract term ; and (5) Tricon was the low overall bidder when
calculating for the initial period and the optional extension period(s) .

        Although it appears that the Protestor failed to strictly comply with the filing
requirements outlined in 19 DCMR §§ 4354 .2 , 4354 .3 and 4354 .5 (Id .), there is no indication
in the record that Protestor was ever aware of or provided a copy of the DCPL's procurement
regulations. We note that the IFB neither makes reference to these regulations nor apprises
potential protestors of their appeal rights. Further, the protest specifically states that it is filed
pursuant to the Board's Rules . Therefore, the Board shall not impute to Protestor constructive
notice of DCPL's procurement regulations and procedures.

       The Board has no evidence in the record before it that Tricon has filed an appeal of the
CCO's decision with the Contracts Review Committee as required by 19 DCMR § 4354.11 (ld .
at 7993) . Therefore, there is neither an appealable decision by the Contracts Review Committee
nor an opportunity for the protestor to deem its appeal to have been denied by the Committee.
19 DCMR § 4354 . 13 (Id .). The regulations clearly state that an appeal may not be brought
before this Board without the protestor first having fully exhausted its administrative remedies.
19 DCMR § 4354 . 16 (Id .). By not first appealing the CCO's written decision to the Contracts
Review Committee (and either awaiting a decision from the Committee or waiting the
appropriate amount of time) before filing an appeal with the Board , Tricon has failed to exhaust
its administrative remedies. 19 DCMR §§ 4354 . 15 (Id.).

        The CCO's May correspondence to the Board does not appear to meet the letter of the
requirements pertaining to a CCO's written decision on a protest of an award as set out in 19
DCMR § 4354 (Id. at 7992 - 7993). However, the Board has deemed this correspondence as
such , and , in light of the fact that the Board finds it imperative that all protestors be afforded
their complete appeal rights, Tricon shall have five (5) working days from the date of this



    2  It should be noted that this response was filed prior to the Office of the Corporation
Coun sel's having filed an appearance in this case -- apparently without coordination with
coun sel.

decision to file an appeal with the Contracts Review Committee. 19 DCMR § 4354.11 (ld . at
7993); Board Rule 301 .2 , 36 DCR at 2710.

        In light of Protestor's failure to exhaust its administrative remedies, as required by the
procurement regulations promulgated by the DCPL, the Board is without jUfisdiction to hear
Tricon's protest. See Impex Industries. Inc., CAB No . D-953, April 15, 1994,7 P.D. 5807;
District Pavinj! Corporation, CAB No. D-954, April 6, 1994, 7 P.D . 5789; Impex International
Industries. Inc., CAB No. D-890, May 15, 1992,40 DCR 4400.


       Therefore, it is hereby

    ORDERED, that the Motion of the District of Columbia to Dismiss the Protest is
GRANTED, and it is

        FURTHER ORDERED, that Protestor shall have five (5) working days from the date
of this Order to file an appeal of the CCO's decision dated May 9 , 1994 with the Contracts
Review Committee of the DCPL, and it is

       FURTHER ORDERED, that the protest is DISMISSED, without prejudice.
