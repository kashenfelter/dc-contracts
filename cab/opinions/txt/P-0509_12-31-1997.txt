                      OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS

        RAM Mobile Data, L.P. qled the instant protest of the Metropolitan Police Depa~ment's
(ccMPD") Request for Proposals No. 97-500 (ccRFP") for wireless mobile data services. l The RFP
solicited two-way data telecommunications services for MPD. RAM contests the ten-day period
between the solicitation issuance and proposal submission, and MPD's refusal to extend the time.
Section C.2.2.2. of the RFP required the submission of "contour maps," showing J 00% coverage
with modem received signal strength equal to or greater than -90dB, expressed in increments of
5dB. RAM did not have maps prepared in the required contour and required about two weeks to
produce them. RAM argued that less-than-30-day deadline unduly limited competition by
permitting insufficient time for qualified potential off'erors like RAM to prepare proposals. RAM
also challenged the RFP evaluation scheme as unduly restrictive for placing more emphasis on one
out of the many factors relevant to performance--network throughput-- rather thap on
performance itself MPD received one timely proposal from Bell Atlantic NYNEx. RAM
submitted a proposal two weeks after the closing date. MPD refused to consider RAM's
proposal. RAM requested that the Board order MPD to consider its proposal.

        On September 23, 1997, MPD filed a Motion to Dismiss RAM's proposal as untimely. By
order dated October 29, 1997, the Board denied MPD's motion and ordered that MPD file its
Agency Report by November 14, 1997. Following receipt of the Agency Report, the Board
ordered MPD to provide further information on the nature of the wireless data technology, the
reason for the shortened solicitation advertising period, and a presentation of arguments setting
forth why it was reasonable for MPD to elevate the performance factor of "network throughput"
above the overall performance.



        lWireless mobile data services permit MPD to receive and transmit time critical files
between patrol cars and agency databases and enable maiVmessage communications. These
services provide a direct, and efficient connection between MPD officers on the street and
information databases, dispatches and other officers.

                                                -2-                CAB No. P-509 RAM Mobile Data, L.P.

        On December 10, 1997, pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1189.8(c)(2), MPD filed a
"Determination and Findings to Proceed with Award and Performance of Contracts While a
Protest is Pending Before the D.C. Contract Appeals Board" ("D&F"), exectued by Richard Fite,
the Chief Procurement Officer of the District of Columbia. On December 17, 1997, RAM filed a
Motion Challenging Override of Stay.                                                 .

        On December 19, 1997, the District responded to the Board's request for additional
information and further argument. On December 19, the District also filed a motion to Dismiss
the Protest for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The District contends that the Board cannot
exercise jurisdiction over this MPD procurement because Congress delegated directly to MPD
small purchase authority up to $500,000 and exempted MPD small purchases from any review by
any official or employee of the District of Columbia government. The estimated cost of this
contract as set forth in the D&F is $90,000.

        The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY 1997 (public Law 104-194, 110
Stat. 2356, Sept. 9, 1996) and for FY 1998 (public Law 105-100, Il1Stat, 2160, Nov. 19, 1997)
provides in pertinent part:

                That notwithstanding any other provision oflaw, or Mayor's Order 86-45, issued
        March 18, 1986, the Metropolitan Police Department's deleted small purchase authority
        shall be $500,000: Providedfurther, That the District of Columbia government may not
        require the Metropolitan Police Department to submit to any other procurement review
        process, or to obtain the approval of or be restricted in any manner by any official or
        employee of the District of Columbia government, for purchases that do not exceed
        $500,000.

        Despite RAM's arguments to the contrary, the language found in the FY 1997 and 1998
Appropriations Acts plainly exempt purchases ofless than $500,000 by MPD from procurement
review by any District official or employee. The Board lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this
protest and is compelled to grant the District's motion to dismiss. Accordingly"the protest is
dismissed.

        SO ORDERED.
