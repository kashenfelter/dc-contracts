                      OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION
                             TO CONSOLIDATE

     On    October   28,   1992,   Centex-Simpson   Construction    Company

("appellant")    filed a notice of appeal with the Board from the

"deemed denial" of its claim for an equitable adjustment in the

amount of $3,262,737.00.      This appeal was docketed as CAB No. 0-929

and was assigned to Judge Terner.       Thereafter, on November 9, 1992,

appellant filed a notice of appeal from a "deemed denial" of its

claim for an equitable adjustment in the amount of $534,000.00 for

additional costs allegedly incurred as a result of differing site

conditions.     The appeal was docketed as CAB No.          0-931 and was

assigned to Judge Lee.

     On December 1, 1992, appellant filed its complaint in CAB No.

D-929.    On December 7, 1992, appellee filed a motion to consolidate

CAB Nos. D-929 and D-931. Y        On December 14, 1992, appellant filed

its complaint in CAB No. D-931.




     1/
     -On December 9, 1992, Chief Judge Bush temporarily assigned
CAB No. D-929 to Judge Lee for the purpose of deciding appellee's
motion to consolidate.

       In   its motion to            consol idate,     appellee contends      that    the

appeals have so many common elements that to treat them separately

would create an undue and costly burden on appellee.                          Appellee

asserts     that      the   issues     in both appeals         arise under the       same

contract and involve the same parties.                  Appellee also contends that

for administrative and legal reasons,                   it is treating appellant's

claims as indivisible.

       In addition, appellee argues that it has been orally informed

that appellant may file additional appeals on different issues

arising under the same contract.

       On December 21, 1992, appellant, through its counsel Sadur,

Pelland     &      Rubinstein,         P. C. ,    opposed     appellee's    motion    to

consolidate in CAB No.               0-931 on the following grounds:           (1)   the

actions are entirely unrelated factually;                      (2) the same witnesses

will   not testify;           (3)    the documents and exhibits will also be

different;      (4)     the    two    actions     do   not    assert   identical   legal

issues; and (5) the relief sought varies materially between the two

appeals.
       For the      reasons set         forth below,         we must deny appellee's

motion to consolidate.

       Rule 118.1 of the Board's Rules of practiceY states:


       When cases involving a common question of law or fact are
       pending before the Board, it may consolidate the cases in
       order to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.

However,

       [t]he determinative factor in understanding whether
       individual claims are merely various aspects of a single
       claim, involving a common set of operative facts, or are
       in fact separate claims, is . . . whether the demand for
       relief arose out of essentially interrelated conduct and
       services and the same, or closely connected, facts.

Richerson Construction, Inc., GSBCA No. 10653, 91-1 BCA                    ~23,538,

citing LDG Timber Enterprises,              Inc. v. united states,        8 CI. ct.

445, 452 (1985).

       A review of the complaint filed in CAB No. D-929 reveals that

the    claim    for   equitable     adjustment      arises   under    Contract    No.

JB/890070       for   construction of       an    ambulatory and critical        care

center adjacent to the north wall of the main D.C. General Hospital

complex.       Appellant is sponsoring the claims of five                (5)   of its

subcontractors and is also claiming additional costs as a result of

failure of a sixth subcontractor to complete alleged cardinally

changed electrical work.          All of the claims concern costs of delay

in    various    aspects   of   the    contract      work,   from    suspension    of

foundation wall activity to radiology area delays.                   Appellant also

cites claims for other delays and contends that its work and that

of its subcontractors was delayed,                disrupted or suspended as a

result of defective design and inadequate contract administration.

Further,    in CAB No.     D-929,     appellant is represented by Braude &

Margulies, P.C. of Washington, D.C.

       In contrast, a review of the complaint filed in CAB No. 0-931

shows that the claim also arises under Contract No.                     JB\890070.

That, however, is where any commonality ends.                        In CAB No. D-931,

appellant    contends       that    it   and     its     excavation       subcontractor

encountered     a    Type    I     differing          site    condition       related   to

unanticipated subsurface debris which resulted in additional costs

for dump fees, labor and equipment and contractor hauler expenses.

The subcontractor involved in CAB No. D-931 is not included as one

of   the   sponsored    subcontractors           in    CAB    No.    D-929.      Finally,

appellant is represented by a different law firm, Sadur, Pelland &

Rubinstein of Washington, D.C.

      Based upon our review of the record thus far, we are wholly

unpersuaded that the appeals are so interrelated that consolidation

is necessary to permit a fair, reasoned and efficient resolution of

these matters.        The delay claims in CAB No.                   D-929 appear to be

predicated in large measure on defective design and inadequate

contract administration, all arising from actual construction of

the facility.       On the other hand, the claim in CAB No. D-931 seems

to be based on differing site conditions related to excavation

prior to the beginning of actual construction.                         Therefore, these

claims are not inextricably intertwined.

      Furthermore, it appears that these claims, while involving the

same parties in one respect, i.e. appellant and appellee will not,

in actuality, involve the same witnesses, documentary evidence and

other facts and circumstances.                 Indeed,       CAB No.    D-929   involves

issues much more extensive and complex than those in CAB No. D-931;

and while "[ t] here is for consideration.                          . the avoidance of
                                      -   5 -

extra costs and delay to the parties             . .," there is also ". . .
the avoidance of waste of adjudicative resources, and that latter

consideration can take precedence over the desires of one or more

of the parties.            "Algernon Blair, Inc., Dawson Construction

Company, Dawson Construction Company (Bonitz Insulation Company) ,

Dawson    Construction       Company       (Masonry   Contractors),     Dawson

Construction     Company     (Floor   Systems,   Inc.),   Atlantic    Electric

Company, Inc, Harrington Associates, Inc., GSBCA Nos. 5881, 5920-

5951, 82-2 BCA    ~15,859.


     Finally, we must consider the potential of prejudice to the

rights of one or more of the parties whose actions have been

consolidated.      "Such prejUdice may result from abrogation of one

party's right to present its claim free from the conflicting and

competing interests of the other parties."            Algernon Blair, supra,

at 77,968.     Here, there do not appear to be common issues present

in these appeals.       Further, consolidation of pre-hearing activities

might prejudice the parties in CAB No. 0-931 in obtaining a more

swift resolution of the matter than they can in CAB No.                0-929,

simply by virtue of the scope of the claims set forth in the latter

docket.      Further,   it does not appear that determination of the

facts and circumstances in one case will definitively drive the

result in the other case.

     with respect to potential, additional claims, appellee asserts

that while the issues arise under the same contract, they will be
                                               - 6 -

different.         Consequently, common questions of law or fact may not

even exist.         That, however, remains to be seen.

        In sum, appellee has not offered any compelling justification

to consolidate these matters; and consequently, it is hereby

       ORDERED,       that appellee's motion to consolidate be,   and the

same is, DENIED; and it is

       FURTHER ORDERED, that the appropriate Appeal Files and answers

to the complaints in both dockets be submitted in accordance with

the Board's Rules of Practice.
