                                            OPINION
                                       Filing ID 38422837

        S3 Integration L.L.C (“S3 Integration” or “S3”) protests the award of a contract for
electronic security systems to Orion Systems Group LLC (“Orion”). S3 Integration challenges
the award on the grounds that the contracting officer did not understand S3 Integration’s bid, and
mistakenly awarded the contract to the wrong bidder. The District responds that S3 Integration
did not understand the bidding requirements of the IFB, and that S3 Integration submitted a bid
that was more than twice as high as the low bid submitted by Orion. After carefully reviewing
the entire record herein, we conclude that the contracting officer did not violate law, regulation,
or the terms of the solicitation in determining Orion to be the low bidder. Accordingly, we deny
the protest.

                                        BACKGROUND

        On August 12, 2010, the District of Columbia government, acting through the
Contracting and Procurement Division of the Department of Real Estate Services (“DRES”) and
on behalf of the Protective Services Police Department (“PSPD”), issued IFB DCAM-2010-B-
0166. Agency Report (“AR”) Ex. 1. The District was looking for a contractor to provide all
management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, transportation, and equipment for the
Electronic Security Systems Operation, Installation and Maintenance Conversion for District
owned and leased facilities. The statement of work required the contractor to both maintain the
current hardware and software in the city wide Electronic Security System, and to convert the
present system to a New Security Management System (“NSMS”) that has more capabilities than
the current system. The IFB contemplated award of a firm fixed price contract. AR Ex. 1,
section B.2.

       Bids were opened on September 17, 2010, the date set forth in IFB Amendment 005 AR
Ex. 6. Three bidders submitted bids, as follows:
                                                 -2-              S3 Integration LLC, CAB No. P-0868


                     Bidder                                      Price
            Orion Systems Group LLC                           $869,000.00
                S3 Integration LLC                           $2,093,713.00
              Condortech Service, Inc.                        $997,096.66
(AR Ex. 10)

        The solicitation required bidders to submit prices for the items set forth in Sections B.5.1
and B.5.2 of the solicitation. The bidders were required to add the Service Lump Sum Price of
Section B.5.1 to the Conversion Lump Sum Price of Section B.5.2 to equal the bid price for the
project. Amendment No. 4 to the solicitation, issued on September 2, 2010, set forth explicit
instructions in attachment b on page 1 regarding the items that would determine the bidder’s
price. AR Ex. 5.

       For the bidders, the sum of the two Lump Sum prices in B.5.1 and B.5.2 were as follows:

                     Bidder                                      Sum
            Orion Systems Group LLC                           $869,000.00
                S3 Integration LLC                            $881,266.00
              Condortech Service, Inc.                        $997,096.66
(AR Ex. 10)

        In the bid document, S3 Integration had entered the larger amount set forth in the first
table above. The amount of $2,093,713.00 is the sum of the lump sum prices set forth in items
B.5.1 and B.5.2 of S3’s bid document. The bid form did not require bidders to add the lump sum
items into one entry.

       In the protest, S3 Integration alleges that the District’s contract specialist, Ms. Helena
Barbour, made a number of statements regarding the evaluation of bids. The specialist, in a
declaration attached to the agency report (AR Ex. 16), dated December 9, 2010, sets forth her
own recollections regarding statements made at the bid opening. She denies making the
statements alleged by the protester. The protester did not submit a response to the agency report.

        The District completed its evaluation of the bids by October 27, 2010. The contract
specialist determined that S3 Integration had improperly prepared its bid, and had included extra
work in the bid items in B.5.2. AR. Ex. 16. She also noted that the written Questions and
Answers issued after the pre-bid conference set forth the District’s intended method of
evaluating the prices that were to be set forth on the bid form.

       The Contracting Officer awarded the contract to Orion on October 27, 2010, for a price
of $869,000. AR Ex. 8. S3 Integration filed this protest on November 12, 2010.

                                          DISCUSSION

       We exercise jurisdiction over the protest pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03 (a)(1).
                                                 -3-              S3 Integration LLC, CAB No. P-0868


         S3 Integration alleged in its protest that the contract specialist at the bid opening
announced that each bidder had a different interpretation of the bid form requirements of the
IFB. S3 Integration further alleges that the contract specialist announced that the District would
request more information from S3 to aid in bid evaluation. S3 alleges that it forwarded
information to the contract personnel after the bid opening, but did not receive any confirmation
of receipt of that information from the District. S3 Integration alleges that after S3’s price is
broken down to one door and one panel, S3 is the lowest bidder. S3 in the protest requests award
of the IFB, or a re-bidding of the solicitation.

         In response, the District argues that S3 Integration’s bid is not responsive to the IFB. S3
Integration presented a bid that included, in Section B, a price to convert all remaining doors and
all remaining panels to the new system. However, the District did not request a price for that
work. As the District asserts in the agency report, the District may not make an award to S3
Integration pursuant to a bid that is not responsive to the IFB. In support of its analysis, the
District presented the declaration of the contract specialist, Ms. Helena Barbour, who provided
information regarding her statements at the bid opening. (AR Ex. 16). S3 Integration did not
respond to the District’s agency report.

         The District may not make an award to a bidder that presented a bid that is not
responsive to the IFB. A responsive bid must present an unequivocal offer to provide the exact
item set forth in the solicitation. When the District accepts a bid, the offeror is bound to perform
the contract in accordance with all of the material terms of the solicitation. In Advance Medical
Systems, Inc., CAB No. P-0202, April 1, 1992, 39 D.C. Reg. 4516, 4518, we quoted the
following from Trail Equipment Co., B-241004, Feb. 1, 1991, 91-1 CPD ¶ 102: “Responsiveness
must be determined at the time of bid opening, and, in general, solely from the face of the bid
and the material submitted with the bid. To allow a bidder to make its nonresponsive bid
responsive after bid opening is tantamount to allowing the bidder to submit a new bid.” Parsons
Precision Products, Inc., 92-2 CPD ¶ 431 (“A bid which is nonresponsive on its face may not be
converted into a responsive bid by post opening bid clarifications or corrections.”).

        The District correctly asserts that it cannot award a contract based on a non responsive
bid. Therefore, we see no reason to express an opinion regarding whether S3 had presented the
lowest bid.

                                         CONCLUSION

       For the reasons discussed above, we dismiss S3 Integration’s protest to the award of the
contract.

       SO ORDERED.
