       Bryan Chaisone, Project Manager for HR General Maintenance Corporation ("HR"
or "Protester"), protests the Department of Public Works ("DPW") award of a contact
(consideration of contract) award to any of the three bidders listed below who submitted bids in
response to the solicitation, IFB No . 98-0 I 09-AA-2-0-CC. The Protester contends that, at bid
opening on May 6, 1998 , three bids should have been excluded from co nsi deration for contract
award for various irregularities in the bid documents.

       On June 12, 1998, the protester fi!ed this protest with the Board.

       The protest is di smissed as untimely.

                                          BACKGROUND

        On April 6, 1998, DPW issued IFB No . 98-01 09-AA-2-0-CC , issued for the replacement
of the roof of the D.C. Correctional Facility, South Wing, Building #299, located at 300 19 'h
Street, S.E.. Bid opening occurred on May 6, 1998, and seven bids were received . At the
time of bid opening the bids were ranked as follows :

       I . SJC                $157,000
       2. A&T                 $188,451
       3. Selective           $254,500
       4 . NAPA               $257,594
       5. HR                  $258,740
       6. Gibson              $266, 170
       7. Kobane              $497,614
                                                                                                    [7581J


                                                  2

       After bid opening, HR, which was awarded the 12% bid preference point reduction,
became the third lowest bidder at a weighted bid of$227,69 1.20. SJC also received a 7% bid
preference point reduction with a weighted bid of $146,0 I 0. On May 8, 1998, DPW found all
seven bids to be responsive.

        On June 12, 1998, the protester filed this protest with the Board asserting that three of the
bids should have been excluded from consideration for contract award for the following reasons :

       "1. SLC Company, Inc.' s price is well below market price and as such, we feel that the
       work cannot be performed properly to specifications and scope for the amount quoted.
       This bid price is unrealistic in that the raw cost to provide this work and raw labor cost
       exceeds there(sic) price.
       2. A&T Associates, Inc. did not have their bid bond signed by their secretary.
       3. NAPA Development Corporation ' s bid package did not include payments to
       subcontractors and suppliers."

       On July 6, 1998, the Government filed a Motion to Dismiss arguing that the protest should
be dismissed because:
       1. HR filed its protest late with the Board;
       2. the issue raised with regard to SJC 's bid is not ripe for review;
       3. the issue raised with regard to A&T's bid is without merit; and
       4. the issue raised with regard to NAPA 's bid is moot.


                                            DECISION

       Board rule 302.2, 45 DCR 1415 (March 13,1998) provides:

       (a) A protest based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation which are apparent
       prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed
       with the Board prior to bid opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals.
       In procurements where proposals are requested, alleged improprieties which do
       not exist in the initial solicitation, but which are subsequently incorporated into this
       solicitation, must be protested not later than the next closing time for receipt of
       proposals following the incorporation .

       (b) Protests other than those covered in paragraph (a) shall be filed with the Board
       not later than ten (10) business days aller the basis of the protest is known or
       should have been known, whichever is earlier.
                                                                                                    [7582]


                                                  3

        The Board calculates that the 10 business day period would have run from May 7, the day
after bid opening, until May 20, 1998. However, the Protester waited until June 12, 1998, long
after the time limit for filing had elapsed . Therefore, the Board is without jurisdiction to hear and
decide the merits of this protest. Accordingly, this protest is dismissed with prejudice.


SO ORDERED.
