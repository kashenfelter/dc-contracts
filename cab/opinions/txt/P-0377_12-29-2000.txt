                                             OPINION

        On February 1, 1993, Eagle Maintenance Services, Inc. ("Eagle") and the District purported
to enter into Contract No. OMS-0132-AA-KH, for Eagle to receive, process, and market recyclable
materials collected by the District. The award was protested by Recycling Solutions, Inc. (“RSI”),
when it learned of the basis for award in June 1993. After extensive protest proceedings, the Board
sustained RSI's protest and declared that the District's purported contract award to Eagle was void ab
initio pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(1). The District's Department of Public Works ("DPW")
sought judicial review of the Board's decision and Eagle continued to perform recycling work under
the invalid contract until the end of April 1995. During the approximate 2-year performance period,
Eagle submitted invoices for payments and Eagle received payments from DPW totaling
$2,070,056. Purporting to settle disputed amounts while Eagle’s cost claim was pending before us,
DPW paid Eagle an additional amount of $1,071,966 in January 1996, which brought the total
payments to Eagle to $3,142,022. To avoid the harsh result of a contractor forfeiting all
compensation for work actually performed, even though no valid contract ever existed, section 1-
1182.5(d)(2) provides that a contractor, who enters into a contract in good faith without knowledge
of or contributing to the procurement violations that rendered the purported contract void, is entitled
to be compensated for reasonable costs it actually incurred. After conducting proceedings regarding
Eagle's compensation under section 1-1182.5(d)(2), including a financial audit conducted by the
Office of the Inspector General, submissions by the parties, and an evidentiary hearing followed by
briefing, the Board concludes that Eagle is entitled to net actual costs incurred on the District
recycling job of $2,182,059. Because the District has made total payment to Eagle of $3,142,022,
the District has overpaid Eagle by $959,963.

                                         BACKGROUND

        This matter arises from the protest of RSI in which RSI contested DPW’s purported contract
award on February 1, 1993 to Eagle under RFP No. OMS-0132-AA-KH. Eagle was to receive,
process, and market recyclable materials collected by DPW, and to buy back recyclable containers
brought to Eagle by District residents. Eagle began performance on March 22, 1993. RSI filed its
protest on June 16, 1993. During protest proceedings, Eagle continued performing and the District
                                                 -2-             Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

made payments on Eagle invoices. In our April 15, 1994 decision, Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB
No. P-377, 42 D.C. Reg. 4550, we sustained RSI's protest and ordered the District inter alia to
cancel Eagle's contract on the ground that the contract was void ab initio. The DPW Director, who
was also the contracting officer, filed an action in Superior Court, Francis v. Recycling Solutions,
Inc., 94-CA-5461, challenging our April 1994 decision, including the Board's holding that the Eagle
contract was void ab initio. Eagle continued to perform recycling services for DPW and DPW
continued to pay Eagle. Because no valid contract ever existed, we will refer to Eagle's work as the
District recycling job.

        On April 18, 1995, the Superior Court dismissed DPW's action. On the same date, we
advised the parties to consult and report back to the Board if further action on our part was needed
regarding the directions contained in our April 1994 decision. By letter dated April 24, 1995, DPW
purported to "cancel" Eagle's contract under Article 6 of the void contract -- essentially, a
convenience termination -- on the grounds that DPW had insufficient funding to continue
performance. (Exhibit 1, Motion of the District of Columbia to Vacate, in Part, the Relief Ordered
by the Board, filed June 5, 1995). On April 28, 1995, Eagle submitted to DPW a demand for a
termination payment in the amount of $6,644,777.05. Eagle later increased its claim to
$6,710,757.22. (Attachment 2, District's August 11, 1995 Status Report). In a submission of
claimed costs to the District’s auditors within the Office of the Inspector General (“OIG”), Eagle set
forth a summary of costs totaling $4,331,706, plus additional costs of acquiring and constructing a
new District-based recycling facility totaling $5,548,367. (HEX 65B, Appendix 1 (Eagle’s Cost and
Revenue Schedules), Schedules 1, 13). In its posthearing brief, Eagle claims that it is entitled to
$9,494,907. (Eagle Brief, at 10).

       Eagle ceased performing the District recycling job on approximately April 30, 1995.

         DPW's purported cancellation of Eagle's void contract for "insufficient funds" violated the
Board's April 1994 order, which required the District to cancel Eagle's contract as void ab initio.
When we became aware of DPW's attempted cancellation, we ordered the District to notify Eagle
that its contract had been declared void ab initio pursuant to the April 1994 decision and D.C. Code
§ 1-1182.5(d). We stated that to the extent that Eagle meets the conditions of D.C. Code § 1-
1182.5(d)(2), compensation to Eagle shall be limited to actual costs reasonably incurred but not
profit. We also directed DPW to make an initial determination, pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-
1182.5(d)(2), as to compensation for costs actually incurred by Eagle. (Order dated June 6, 1995, at
3). DPW subsequently advised Eagle that DPW would be determining amounts due Eagle under
D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2). (Id., Ex. 6, at 2).

        During the approximate 2-year performance period that Eagle performed without a valid
contract, Eagle received compensation (purported contract payments) from the District for the
recycling services Eagle performed. As of April 30, 1995, Eagle had received payments from DPW
totaling $2,070,056. (HEX 65B, OIG Attachments, Schedule K, at 1-2). It appears that during the
second half of 1995, DPW did not make any statutory determination of compensation under D.C.
Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2). Meanwhile, DPW had awarded an emergency contract for recycling services
to Eagle and Eagle was performing essentially the same types of recycling services as it had before.
By January 1996, DPW still had not made a proper determination of Eagle’s actual costs of
performance under D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2). Indeed, DPW’s then contracting officer apparently
                                                  -3-             Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

attempted to settle the matter directly with Eagle's president by making a $1,079,000 payment to
Eagle by check dated January 2, 1996. (HEX 65B, OIG Attachments, Schedule K, at 3). That
payment brought the total amount DPW had paid Eagle to $3,142,022. (Id.). Because DPW
appeared unable to make the determination required by section 1-1182.5(d)(2), we directed that
Eagle and the District prepare detailed schedules of Eagle's actual costs and revenue under the
District recycling job and submit them to the Board. (Order of March 26, 1996). The Office of
Corporation Counsel, on behalf of the District, requested the Office of the Inspector General conduct
an audit of Eagle’s costs and revenue.

I.     Pertinent Portions of the Record

        The Inspector General prepared an initial audit report dated August 10, 1996, entitled
"Report on Audit of Costs Claimed and Revenues Earned on Eagle Maintenance's Contract No.
OMS-0132-AA-KH With the Department of Public Works," OIG No. 9612-07, with OIG’s
Financial Schedules A-C, K, K-(A), K-1 to K-4, Appendix 1 containing Eagle’s June 3, 1996
submission of Schedules 1-13, and the following supporting documentation packages assembled by
OIG: (i) Supporting Documentation for Labor Costs; (ii) Eagle Financial Statements for 1993-1995;
(iii) Supporting Documentation for Other Direct Costs and Subcontractor Costs; (iv) Supporting
Documentation for Intermediate Facility Costs; (v) Supporting Documentation for Market Revenues;
(vi) Eagle Invoices (Feb. 1993 - Apr. 1995); and (vii) Department of Public Works ("DPW")
Payment Vouchers (Feb. 1993 - Jan. 1996).

        On September 17, 1996, the Board held a conference with the parties and reviewed the initial
audit report and supporting documentation. In a September 18, 1996 order, the Board directed that
Eagle produce additional documentation and provide information by means of affidavits in order to
support findings of allowability and allocability of claimed costs for labor, labor burden, other direct
costs (“ODCs”), subcontract costs, and general and administrative (“G&A”) costs. The OIG was
directed to prepare a supplemental audit report based on the additional documentation and
information. The OIG issued an interim audit report dated November 4, 1996, providing
supplemental findings, stating that Eagle had not produced all required documentation and
information, and that OIG would continue performing additional audit steps. The Board issued
orders of November 26, December 13, and December 18, 1996, directing Eagle to produce
documentation and support for claimed costs. Included in the record as Eagle Exhibits 1-64 are
Eagle labor distribution summary reports (“LDSRs”), Eagle Management payroll and financial
documentation, Eagle and Eagle Management tax records, Eagle general ledger detail reports, and
Eagle and Eagle Management cost account indices. These records were produced to the OIG on or
about December 18, 1996. On December 18, Eagle filed indices of three earlier packages of
documents produced to the OIG.

        The OIG issued its "Final Follow-Up Report on the Audit of Costs Claimed by Eagle
Maintenance Services, Inc." (the "final audit report"), Audit Report No. 9612-07B, dated March 5,
1997. (HEX 65A). The final audit report provided its audit results based on the material provided
by Eagle along with explanatory notes. The Board held an evidentiary hearing on March 19, April
15, May 7, and May 16, 1997, and the record includes transcripts of those hearings and hearing
exhibits (“HEX”) received into evidence during the hearings. After the first hearing day, the Board
directed Eagle to supplement the record with the original vendor/subcontractor files containing all
                                                 -4-             Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

invoices, vouchers, and evidence of payment for each claimed cost. (Board Order, dated March 21,
1997). On April 3, 1997, Eagle submitted 3 boxes containing the vendor files for Eagle
Maintenance, the vendor files for Eagle Management, vendor history reports for Eagle and Eagle
Management, general ledger detail for two Eagle cost accounts, and several Eagle Management
invoices. After the April 15 hearing date, the Board directed Eagle to supplement the record with
records that were missing from earlier productions, including vendor documentation supporting the
“Other” and “Other Reimbursement” categories of costs claimed by Eagle in its Schedules 2A and
3A which were part of the June 3, 1996 submission by Eagle to the OIG. The Board subsequently
directed Eagle to file documentation relating to the entities that it marketed recyclable materials,
whether end user or broker. (Board Order of April 28 and May 2, 1997). Eagle filed responses on
May 2, May 6, and June 30, 1997. The OIG and the District submitted additional supporting
documentation, including filings on May 8 and May 19. Also included in the record is the
consolidated exhibit file for the underlying protest, containing inter alia the District’s Request for
Proposals, Eagle’s proposal and Best and Final Offers (BAFOs), the (invalid) contract between
Eagle and the District; and the pleadings submitted in connection with the underlying protest and
Eagle’s cost claim.

II.    Performance Required by the Statement of Work

       The RFP

       The purpose of the Request for Proposals, as revised, was to solicit proposals from
contractors to:

       receive, process, and market recyclable ferrous and nonferrous metal, glass, and plastic food
       and beverage containers (recyclables) collected by DPW or its agents;

       accept recyclables from District registered commercial/private recycling haulers who choose
       to bring designated recyclables to the contractor’s facility;

       receive newspapers collected by DPW and to ship them to the District’s existing newspaper
       market, Capitol Fibre, using DPW-supplied tractor trailers;

       and establish a “buy back” operation within the District, to receive and pay for recyclables
       brought to the contractor by District residents.

(Protest Consolidated Exhibit (“PCX”) 3, Solicitation No. OMS-0132-AA-KH, Addendum No. 5, at
34-35). Based on DPW’s then current collection of recyclables from an estimated 99,100 single
family households, and 1,500 residential condominium, cooperative, and public housing buildings,
and commercial haulers’ collections from an estimated 146,000 apartment households and numerous
businesses, and assuming a 60 percent participation rate from DPW served residential households, a
40 percent participation from condominiums and cooperatives, DPW estimated that the recycling
contractor could expect annual tonnages of 31,883 from the residential sector (newspaper accounting
for 20,000), or about 2,657 tons per month. The annual estimate from the commercial sector was
128,839 tons of recyclables, assuming a 40 percent participation rate. (Id.).
                                                  -5-             Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

        Eagle’s Initial Proposal and BAFO

        In its initial technical proposal, Eagle stated that its Multi-Material Resource Recovery
Center, located at 5941 Central Avenue, Capitol Heights, Maryland, had sufficient capacity to
process both its existing volume of recyclable materials plus the anticipated tonnage to be collected
by DPW. (PCX 23, at 4, 39). It stated that it planned to build another recycling facility in the
District shortly after the contract was awarded so that it could “receive and process all the
recyclables collected in the District . . . .” (Id., at 5, 29).

        Eagle stated that the Capitol Heights facility, owned by its President, Richard W. Tynes, Jr.,
consisted of a building facility with a 28 foot high ceiling and a tipping floor of approximately
25,000 square feet, and a yard of approximately 25,000 square feet. (Id. at 12; PCX 21, at 5). The
yard has a loading dock capable of accommodating tractor trailers, a parking area capable of
accommodating additional tractor trailers, a 15,000 square foot storage area for finished goods
awaiting transportation to recycling markets, and a scale area capable of generating computer printed
weights of vehicles bring recyclables to the facility. (PCX 23, at 12). The building facility, having a
140 x 90 foot processing floor, consists of a weighing area where the scales are located, a newspaper
area where newspapers are stored for processing and packaging, a commingled area where all
commingled recyclables are stored for processing, a tipping area where all recyclables are unloaded
and stored for processing, a processing area where both commingled and separated recyclables are
sorted, processed, and packaged for shipment to various markets across the country, and a loading
area where the processed goods are loaded onto tractor trailers for shipment to market. (Id. at 12-
13).

        Eagle also stated in its proposal that

        The use of automated equipment allows us to operate efficiently and effectively with the
        least amount of man hours. Currently we process approximately 800 tons a month using 8
        laborers working an eight hour shift, five days a week. As previously mentioned, our facility
        is capable of processing approximately 2,000 tons of recyclable materials per month. This
        level of processing can be achieved with approximately 15 laborers working two eight hour
        shifts, five days a week.

(Id. at 13).

        Eagle stated in its proposal that it had been in the business of processing recyclable materials
since May 1990, that it keeps a daily log book indicating the customer who delivered the materials
and vehicle identification, the time and date of delivery, the type of materials delivered, whether the
material was separated or commingled, weight of materials delivered and weight ticket number, and
a notation if the delivered material is determined to be abnormally contaminated. (Id. at 15). Eagle
stated that it maintained management activity reports which include daily tonnages received, daily
weights and percentages of unmarketable and/or contaminated materials, daily tonnages recyclables
sold, daily receipts of revenue from recyclable sales, and the amount of rebates due its customers.
(Id. at16). In accounting for commingled materials, Eagle stated that it used daily averages and that
past experience had shown that approximately 15 percent of all recyclable materials delivered was
non-processable material (also called “bypass”) which was unmarketable and would be sent to
                                                  -6-            Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

landfills for disposal. Eagle would keep track of the percentage of marketable versus unmarketable
material. (Id. at 16-17).

       Eagle also stated that it has been receiving, processing, and marketing recyclable ferrous and
non-ferrous metals, glass, plastic, newsprint, and office paper for Prince George’s County, the City
of Takoma Park, and the Environmental Protection Agency. (Id. at 17). For the PG County
contract, which was for the period May 1990 to May 1992, Eagle performed processing and
packaging of recyclable materials for about 72,000 homes (id. at 39), but PG County marketed the
material itself (Id. at 19). As of October 1990, Eagle processed approximately 1,000 tons of
newspaper and 100 tons of glass per month. (Id., Attachment I, at 3). In its April 1992 BAFO,
Eagle stated that PG County recyclables accounted for about 50 percent of its total processing
capacity and that Eagle would reserve the other 50 percent for the District’s recyclables. (PCX 21,
at 2). Eagle’s contract with EPA entailed the recovery, collection, sorting, and delivery of
recyclable materials. (Id. at 40). For the City of Takoma Park, Eagle performed processing and
marketing of commingled recyclables. (Id. at 40).

        In its BAFO, Eagle stated that its existing facility had the capacity to handle all of the
estimated tonnage defined in the RFP of DPW-delivered recyclable materials, apparently excluding
the estimated recyclables coming from commercial haulers. In responding to the District’s question
about the status of the interim facility, Eagle replied:

       As previously mentioned, our existing facility is fully operational. We are currently
       operating at 50% of our total capacity and processing approximately sixty (60) tons of
       recyclable materials daily.

(PCX 21, at 14). In other words, Eagle had a capacity of processing 120 tons of recyclables per day,
or between 2,400 and 2,700 tons in a month, assuming processing only on weekdays. With the
addition of the proposed new facility, Eagle said it would be able to handle commercial haulers as
well as recyclable materials from other jurisdictions. (PCX 21, at 7-8). Eagle stated that its existing
facility had 15,000 square feet of storage space, equating to approximately 10 storage days. (Id. at
8).

         Eagle described its processing of the various materials using its automated equipment and
methods as follows: recycled glass is emptied into a hopper which is connected to Eagle’s
automated conveying system (sort line); as the glass travels down the conveyor belt, Eagle’s sorters
separate the clear, brown, and green glass; the separated glass is fed into a glass crusher and the
product is deposited into boxes for shipping to market. Metals are emptied into a hopper connected
to the sort line; the nonferrous and ferrous metal are separated on a magnetized conveyor belt; the
separated metals are then deposited into can condensers; and the resulting condensed blocks of metal
are stacked on pallets for shipping to market. Plastics are emptied into a hopper connected to the
sort line, and sorters separate the plastic which goes to a hopper connected to a baler, where the
plastic is perforated and compressed into bales, stacked on pallets, and shipped to markets. Eagle
stated that it is essential that paper products are separated when delivered in order to avoid
contamination. The paper is loaded into paper balers which bind the paper into bales, which are then
stacked on pallets, and shipped to market. (Id. at 18-19).
                                                    -7-              Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

         In its initial price proposal, Eagle proposed for the first year a unit price of $58.76 per ton for
processing and marketing the 11,983 estimated annual tons of commingled recyclables, $15.12 per
ton for the newspaper transfer service for the 20,000 estimated annual tons of newspaper, and $145
per ton for the 250 estimate tons of material purchased in the buy back operations. Eagle further
offered to rebate to the District 10 percent of gross marketing proceeds. (PCX 21, Attachment A).
Eagle’s proposal provided gradual increases in each of the unit prices and the marketing rebate in
subsequent years. In its BAFO, Eagle proposed a constant 14 percent marketing proceeds rebate
over the life of the contract. (PCX 23, at 3). Its unit prices for processing, newspaper transfer, and
buy back services remained unchanged in its BAFO. Eagle’s BAFO Year 1 cost and pricing data
showed a total labor cost of $408,444.40, consisting of one project manager ($35,006.40), two
supervisors ($49,920), three workers in the category “lead worker—plant” ($56,784), 16 workers in
the category “laborer-plant” ($242,944), and two workers for the buy back operations ($23,790).
Although the labor costs show a gradual escalation in Years 2-5, based on increases in labor rates,
the number of workers was constant in each of the five years. Eagle used a labor burden rate of 22
percent to calculate its Year 1 labor burden cost of $89,857.77. The Year 1 schedule also showed
other direct costs of $440,618, consisting of occupancy ($262,500), utilities ($45,000), equipment
($109,500), repair and maintenance ($18,000), and supplies ($5,618). A note on the schedule states
that: “Other direct costs are based on prior experience and estimated costs associated with the
construction of the recycling facility. Building and equipment costs are depreciated based on their
estimated useful life.” The other direct costs remained constant throughout the five years. The Year
1 schedule shows general and administrative (“G&A”) costs of $103,281.22 based on a G&A rate of
11 percent of total costs. Eagle stated that its G&A rate was actually 13.89 percent. (PCX 21,
Schedule of G&A Expenses). Eagle indicated in its BAFO that it would rely on proceeds from the
marketing of recyclables for its profit on the job. As a result, the Year 1 schedule shows only
$569.69 for “profit/fee.” (PCX 21, at 3).

         The RFP allowed the successful contractor initially to have its processing facility within a 10
mile radius from the District. Within 2 years after contract award, the RFP required the contractor to
locate a processing facility within the District. (PCX 3, at 1, 3). Eagle proposed opening a 46,350
square foot facility on 5.7 acres of land on W Street, between 15th and 16th Streets, N.E., within 1
year of award. (PCX 23, at 27, 34). Eagle represented that it had a commitment to acquire the land.
 (Id. at 27, Ex. VII, at 4). Stating that its Capitol Heights facility had the capacity for handling all of
the recyclables delivered by DPW, the proposed new facility would be staffed with 14-18 laborers
working one 8 hour shift, five days a week, to handle the significant volume of commercial
recyclables DPW estimated in its solicitation. Eagle said it could achieve economies in the new
facility by using equipment that would have a greater processing capacity than the equipment in its
existing facility. (Id. at 29-30).

        Eagle’s Contract

     On February 1, 1993, the District and Eagle purported to enter into Contract No. OMS-0132-
AA-KH. The contract provided that:

        The contractor shall receive, process and market recyclable nonferrous and ferrous metal,
        glass, and plastic food and beverage containers (recyclables) collected by the District. The
        services provided shall also include the acceptance, temporary storage and loading of
                                                  -8-             Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

       newspapers collected by the Department of Public Works (DPW) into District supplied
       tractor trailers. The contractor shall provide a facility with sufficient capacity to
       accommodate District registered commercial/private haulers who choose to bring the
       recyclables defined in this section of the contract to the contractor’s facility. In addition, the
       contractor shall establish a buy back operation within the District in order to buy recyclables
       at market rates from District residents.

       The contractor’s interim processing facility shall be located within a ten (10) mile radius of
       the District’s boarder for the first year after contract award; however, beginning on the first
       day of the second year of the contract, the contractor must have a fully operational
       processing facility within the District from which all activities, except buy back operations,
       associated with performance of this contract shall be conducted. . . .

(PCX 12, Art. 1). The contract identified Eagle’s Capitol Heights facility as the interim processing
facility, stated that 50 percent of that facility’s capacity – a minimum of 1,000 tons per month --
shall be reserved for District generated recyclables, and that Eagle shall process all District
generated recyclables whether delivered by the District or commercial/private haulers. (Id., Art. 1,
§§ 1.1-1.3). The contract incorporated the interim facility specifications set forth in Eagle’s initial
proposal and BAFO, including that the facility was to be a “fully automated processing facility”
equipped with two fully functional loading docks capable of handling simultaneously four vehicles,
a mechanized sorting line, glass crusher, balers for metal and plastic, computerized weighing system,
fork lift and bobcat. (Id., Art. 1, §§ 1.4-1.6). Eagle was to provide approximately 15 laborers
working two 8-hour shifts, five days a week. (Id., Art. 1, § 1.6.2). The contract also incorporated
Eagle’s automated procedures for processing the various types of recyclables and a contingency plan
in the case of equipment failure in order to insure the uninterrupted delivery of District generated
recyclables. (Id., Art. 1, § 1.7).

        Eagle was to maintain detailed daily logs to account for the recyclable materials collection,
processing, and marketing phases of the work. The daily logs were to record customers, date and
time of delivery, types and weight of recyclables delivered, and abnormalities such as high
contamination. (Id., Art. 1, § 1.8.1). From these daily logs, Eagle was to generate monthly reports
containing daily weights of District generated recyclables, daily weights and percentages of
unmarketable/contaminated materials, daily sales of recyclables, daily receipts of revenue from
sales, and the amount of rebate due the District. (Id., Art. 1, § 1.8.2). Commingled materials were to
be accounted for initially by using 15 percent as the percentage of non-processable (unmarketable)
recyclable material. Eagle was to examine commingled materials to calculate the percentage of
recyclables by type, calculating the weight of each type of marketable recyclable delivered, and
periodically redetermine the percentage of unmarketable recyclables by using the actual daily
weights of unmarketable residue and processed recyclables. (Id., Art. 1, § 1.8.3).

        The contract incorporated Eagle’s proposal and BAFO specifications for its planned District
based facility, including equipment and labor requirements. (Id., Art. 1, § 2). The first and only
bilateral modification of the purported contract, entered into by the District and Eagle also on
February 1, 1993, provided, inter alia, that:
                                                  -9-            Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

       The contractor is responsible for obtaining all permits necessary to establish the recycling
       processing and buy back facilities in the District. By executing this contract the District does
       not waive any requirements of law or the right to review permit application in accordance
       with applicable criteria. The processing and buy back facilities are private facilities which
       are the sole responsibility of the contractor.

      The bilateral modification also set forth the total estimated annual payments which were to
be made in accordance with Eagle’s proposal and BAFO as follows:

       Year 1 -- $1,042,771.08
       Year 2 -- $1,068,080.00
       Year 3 -- $1,094,645.57
       Year 4 -- $1,122,190.12
       Year 5 -- $1,150,676.49

       Eagle Performance

         Prior to contract execution on February 1, 1993, Eagle’s contract for processing PG County
recyclables (Eagle was a subcontractor of Waste Management, the prime contractor) was terminated
because PG County’s own processing facility had become operational. Although Eagle’s president,
Mr. Tynes, could not recall the approximate date of the termination, Eagle’s CFO, Mr. Furby, stated
that it must have occurred some time late in 1992. Nevertheless, Eagle continued to haul PG County
recyclables as a subcontractor of Waste Management.

         The District began collecting residential recycling and delivering the recyclables to Eagle on
March 22, 1993. (Tr. 12-13). According to DPW records, compiled from reports provided by Eagle,
the District had, by the end of March, delivered to Eagle 353.88 tons of recyclables, consisting of
269.15 tons of newspaper and the remainder being either unmarketable or unaccounted material for
which Eagle had not furnished information in its reports. (Hearing Ex. (“HEX”) 1A). Indeed, Eagle
did not maintain the required daily logs. The record shows that from the start of performance, Eagle
did not have sufficient capacity at its existing Capitol Heights facility (the “interim” facility) to
handle the quantity of recyclables delivered to it by DPW. The District first notified Eagle of the
deficiencies by letter of March 26, 1993, followed by a meeting of the parties’ representatives on
March 29, and by a written response from Eagle on April 1. The District agreed to assist Eagle
during the last several days of March and throughout April by accepting a portion of the recyclables
at a non-Eagle facility designated by the District. (RSI App., PEX 130 (DC/CAB 00067-00070);
Francis letter to Tynes, dated July 27, 1993). It appears from the correspondence that the alternate
facility was operated by Consolidated Waste Industries (“CWI”) and located on W Street. CWI used
the facility for processing and marketing District recyclables under another contract with the
District. The CWI contract with the District was to end on April 30, 1993, so DPW notified Eagle
that it would have to be able to accept all DPW delivered recyclables starting May 1. (RSI App.,
PEX. 130 (DC/CAB 00067-00070); Francis letter to Tynes, dated July 27, 1993). For April 1993,
Eagle received 1,184.78 tons of recyclables and the remaining recyclables collected by DPW,
probably amounting to 800-1,000 tons, were delivered to CWI’s W Street facility as designated by
DPW. During April, Eagle was unable to account for 400.73 tons of recyclables. (HEX 1A).
                                                  - 10 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

        In its April 1 letter, Eagle complained that the quantities being delivered by DPW were
greater than estimated in the RFP. Eagle seemed to be stating that because the newspaper was
collected with the other recyclables in DPW’s packer trucks using the “blue bag” system, the
recyclables being delivered, including the newspaper, were all commingled recyclables. Eagle,
however, was well aware in the fall of 1992 or earlier, and thus prior to contract award, of the
method DPW would use for collecting recyclables. Thus, the contract’s newspaper transfer service
consisting of “acceptance, temporary storage and loading of newspapers collected by [DPW] into
District supplied tractor trailers” (PCX 12) included separating the newspaper from the other
recyclables, bundling the paper, and loading it into the trailers. Moreover, the actual quantities of
residential recyclables being collected were consistent with the residential quantities estimated in the
RFP. Since Eagle’s recycling processing contract with PG County was terminated prior to the start
of the District job, Eagle’s represented capacity at its interim facility of 2,000 tons per month should
have been adequate to handle the District’s quantities. In fact, Eagle was unable to achieve the
represented processing capacity, at least during much of 1993. Eagle’s problems resulted from its
labor force and interim facility being used for other jobs, the facility and recycling equipment being
in various states of disrepair, and the facility’s processing and storage capacity not being as large as
represented. (Tynes letter to Shields, dated April 1, 1993; RSI App., PEX 130 (DC/CAB 00067-
00070); Francis letter to Tynes, dated July 27, 1993; PEX 143 (DC/CAB 00007-00008)).

        During the early period of performance, Eagle claimed that there was a higher than expected
amount of newspaper being contaminated with broken glass caused by DPW’s packer trucks
crushing all of the recyclables together. DPW claimed that any glass contamination was caused by
Eagle’s own equipment crushing the glass into the paper while it sat piled up on the facility’s
processing floor stemming from Eagle’s failure to promptly separate the paper from the other
recyclables and load the paper into the trailers. Although DPW was probably responsible for most
of the glass contamination, the problem of a number of loads of newspaper being rejected by Capitol
Fiber during April 1993 appears to have been resolved quickly. (Francis letter to Tynes, dated July
27, 1993; RSI App., PEX 384, DC 7734-7738).

         Eagle also complained on April 1 that DPW was not timely providing the trailers and
transporting the newspapers from Eagle’s facility to Capitol Fiber. According to Mr. Tynes, the
District probably hauled 50 or 60 percent of the newspaper during 1993 and less than half for the
remainder of the performance period. (Tr. 41-43). For the months of March through December
1993, Eagle processed and marketed a total of 10,402.66 tons of newspaper. (HEX 1, 1A). For the
months of January 1994 through May 1995, Eagle processed and marketed a total of 21,492.02.66
tons of newspaper. (HEX 1, 1A). Based on Mr. Tynes’ testimony, we find that the District hauled
to Capitol Fiber 55 percent of the newspaper during 1993 and 45 percent of the newspaper during
the remainder of the performance period. Thus, we find that Eagle had to deliver 45 percent (for
1993) and 55 percent (for the remainder of performance) of the newspaper to Capitol Fiber.
Expressed in tons, Eagle had to transport to Capitol Fiber 4,681.20 tons of newspaper during 1993
and 11,820.61 tons of newspaper during the remainder of the performance period. Both the District
and Eagle contributed to the newspaper transfer problem. DPW’s witness admitted that the District
had problems fulfilling its responsibility of hauling the loaded newspaper to Capitol Fiber. (PCX 21,
at 8; Tr. 572-573). By the same token, Eagle had represented in its BAFO that it had 15,000 square
feet of storage space equating to a capacity of approximately 10 storage days for recyclables, but the
record shows that it was having difficulty storing one days worth of newspaper. (Tynes letters to
                                                  - 11 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

Shields, dated November 4, 1993, December 8, 1994, and January 12, 1994; Tr. 572-573). The
record also indicates that at times Eagle was slow in loading the paper into the District trailers, even
when trailers were available. (RSI App., PEX 130 (DC/CAB 00067-00070), PEX 143 (DC/CAB
00007-00008)).

         When DPW advised Eagle that the District would not continue to provide it an alternate
facility for receiving delivery of recyclables after April 30, and that Eagle would have to devise a
contingency plan to fulfill its responsibility of accepting all DPW delivered recyclables, Eagle
entered into a memorandum of understanding with CWI, effective May 1, 1993, whereby CWI
would receive a portion of DPW recyclable deliveries at its Olive Street facility in Capital Heights,
separate the newspaper from the other recyclables, and transport the newspaper to Capitol Fiber.
Eagle would then have the other recyclables delivered to its interim facility. (RSI App., PEX 357
(RSI LIT 654-655). Mr. Tynes testified that Eagle employees, not CWI employees, performed the
processing at the CWI facility. (Tr. 113-115). According to the MOU, Eagle would pay CWI $65
per ton received from DPW but Eagle would receive a payment from CWI of $30 per ton for the
non-paper recyclables. In other words, CWI would receive $65 per ton for receiving and
transporting the newspapers to Capitol Fiber and would receive $35 per ton for receiving the non-
paper recyclables. Mr. Tynes stated that he could not remember how he arrived at the MOU pricing.
 (Tr. 113-115). Although Mr. Tynes denied that a component of its cost was for use of CWI’s
facility, we find that the $35 per ton price for simply receiving DPW delivered non-paper represents
a facility usage cost. We also find that $35 of the $65 per ton price for the newspaper services
represents facility usage cost. Of the 2,220 tons of recyclables for May 1993 collected by DPW,
CWI received 1,395 tons. (HEX 1A, 10). For June 1993, CWI received 978 tons of recyclables out
of a total of 2,363 tons. (HEX 1A, 11). According to correspondence from Capitol Fiber, they had
received during June a total of 781 tons of paper from Eagle but only 241 tons of paper from CWI,
indicating that CWI “continue[s] to divert tonnage to other markets” notwithstanding that Capitol
Fiber did not reject any paper delivered in June by CWI. (Jones letter to Shields, dated July 1,
1993). For July 1993, CWI received 906 tons of recyclables out of a total of 2,037 tons. (HEX 1A,
12). Eagle’s correspondence indicates the following destination of recyclables received by CWI
during July: 425 tons of newspaper went to Capitol Fiber, 56 tons of other non-paper recyclables
went to BFI, 249 tons of non-paper recyclables went to Eagle, and 153 tons of newspaper and 23
tons of non-paper recyclables went to Laidlaw. (HEX 12). The record also shows that on July 2,
1993, a fire at Eagle’s interim facility damaged portions of the facility as well as equipment
including the sorting system and the scales. (Attachment to May 2, 1997 filing). Mr. Tynes stated
that the fire destroyed various company records including many personnel records.

        For August 1993, CWI received 1,176 tons of recyclables out of a total of 1,974 tons. (HEX
1A, 13). For September 1993, CWI received 662 tons of recyclables out of a total of 1,945 tons.
(HEX 1A, 14). Eagle’s documentation indicates the following destination of recyclables received by
CWI during September: 435 tons of newspaper went to Capitol Fiber, 8 tons of non-paper
recyclables went to Eagle, and 28 tons of newspaper and 190 tons of non-paper recyclables went to
Laidlaw. (HEX 14). After September 1993, it appears that Eagle continued to use CWI’s Olive
Street facility for receiving District recyclables. (E.g., Friend’s Tire & Fleet Service invoices dated
8/24/94, 4/29/94, in Eagle Management original invoice files). We find that in lieu of payments
pursuant to the May 1, 1993 MOU, Eagle was able to continue using CWI’s facility based on later
fee arrangements for the sizeable amount of hauling, disposal, and truck weighing services that
                                                   - 12 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

Eagle committed to send to CWI. In a January 10, 1994 letter to DPW, Eagle designated CWI’s
Olive Street facility and two other vendors’ facilities as alternative sites for receiving DPW
recyclables should Eagle’s interim facility be unavailable. It is not clear from the record whether
DPW trucks were ever diverted to sites other than Eagle’s and CWI’s. Nevertheless, CWI continued
to provide hauling, weighing, and disposal services for Eagle throughout the remainder of the
District recycling job although it was paid under arrangements differing from that provided in the
May 1993 MOU. (HEX 2, at 58; HEX 2C, at 1; HEX 54 (Tynes letter to Lash, dated July 5, 1994)).
 In a March 1, 1994 Eagle letter to CWI, Tynes “confirms our understanding regarding the
[recyclable] materials we anticipate delivering to your facility . . . .” (HEX 54). It is not clear from
the letter what the details of the proposed arrangement were but it appears to contemplate that
materials would be delivered to CWI’s facility and that processing would take place at the facility.

         In responding to a Board order of October 10, 1996, questioning whether Eagle’s claimed
labor costs were incurred only on the District recycling job, Eagle filed an affidavit of Mr. Tynes in
which he averred that Eagle “had no other recycling jobs involving recycling processing” during the
entire period of February 1, 1993, through April 30, 1995. (Tynes Aff. ¶ 2, dated October 16, 1996).
During the hearing in 1997, we discovered that this statement was misleading. Because Eagle
entered the recycling business as an extension of its janitorial business where it collected items
which could be processed and marketed as recyclables, Eagle continued to use the Capitol Heights
facility for processing recyclables obtained from its existing janitorial contracts. It also had obtained
some recycling contracts in the 1991-1992 period. Thus, Eagle used the Capitol Heights facility for
processing recyclables from the janitorial contracts, other recycling contracts, and private haulers
who brought material to Eagle’s facility. During the proposal phase, Eagle touted its recycling
experience by citing its contracts with Prince George’s County, the City of Takoma Park, and the
Environmental Protection Agency. (PCX 23, Sec. B, at 17, 19; PCX 21, at 8). Although its contract
for processing PG County recyclables had been terminated prior to March 1993, Eagle continued to
collect PG recyclables and deliver them to PG County’s facility on Richie Road, using its own trucks
and drivers. (See Tr. 65-66). In responding to a DPW pre-contract request for responsibility data in
September 1992, Eagle identified two other recycling contracts involving the processing and
marketing of recyclables: one with Dow Chemical for processing recyclables collected from
containers on the National Mall, and another with the U.S. Public Health Service for recyclables
collected from its Parklawn Complex in Rockville, Maryland. (RSI App. DC 001705). A 1995
invoice indicates that the National Mall recycling was at some point performed under a contract with
the National Park Service. (RSI App., at DC 003670-003671). The National Mall recycling covered
the entire period from February 1993 through April 1995 and beyond. (Tr. 67-69). Tynes could not
recall whether Eagle was collecting recyclables at the Crystal City complex. (Tr. 75). Eagle also
collected recyclables from a residential development within the District called The Cluster under a
contract with Waste Management. (Tr. 79-82). Eagle may also have been collecting recyclables
from the Washington Design Center. (Tr. 83). During the hearing on its actual costs, Mr. Tynes
downplayed Eagle’s other contracts involving handling and processing of recyclables at the interim
facility, stating that the quantity from non-DPW sources was quite small, amounting only to one
percent. (Tr. 21-24). He testified that the one percent of recyclables came from the Washington
Convention Center janitorial contract. (Tr. 23-24). He could not recall all of the janitorial and other
recycling contracts from which recycling materials were brought to the Central Avenue facility, but
he claimed that the amount was “slight.” (Tr. 24). Finally, the contract required Eagle to accept
recyclables delivered by commercial haulers though Mr. Tynes said there were very few of such
                                                  - 13 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

deliveries. We find that Mr. Tynes was not credible in his testimony concerning the allocation
between DPW and non-DPW delivered recyclables. The documentary evidence suggests that
substantially more than 1 percent of the recyclables processed at the interim facility came from non-
DPW sources. We also draw an adverse inference from Eagle’s failure to produce documentation to
support its claimed allocation for the interim facility. We find that it is more likely that the
percentage of recyclable materials handled at the interim facility and coming from non-DPW sources
was at least 5 percent of the facility’s total recyclables. One 1995 monthly invoice concerning the
National Park Services’ National Mall recycling shows a monthly recyclables quantity of
approximately 25 tons, which constitutes by itself over one percent of the monthly DPW-collected
recyclables handled at Eagle’s interim facility. (Id. at DC003670-003671, 003672-003673). There
is nothing in the record to suggest that this quantity was not normal for the April 1993 through April
1995 period.

         After the commingled materials were separated by type, Eagle would then market them.
Tynes testified that for the materials other than metal, the market entities would arrange for
transporting the material to the market’s facility. (See Tr. 50-52). For metal, Alcoa had a local
facility so Eagle would have the metal transported to Alcoa. Strangely, Tynes testified that he rarely
transported metal from the interim facility but rather from CWI’s facility. (Id.). In the recycling
industry, recycling contractors sometimes use a broker who in turn arranges for the sale of
recyclables to a market. Mr. Tynes at first testified that he used brokers on the District recycling job
(Tr. 92) but later stated that he did not use a broker for the District job and could not remember ever
using a broker in the past (Tr. 98), and then stated that he used brokers “very, very sparingly and I
just don’t remember using a broker off the top of my head” and that he would “use various sources,
not necessarily a broker” (Tr. 100). Near the end of the hearing, he testified that “[I]n some
instances we would deal with a broker.” (Tr. 879). Depending on the arrangement, Eagle might
receive revenue from the broker less any commissions charged by the broker. (Tr. 97-100). Tynes
seemed sure that he marketed District recyclables to Alcoa, Union Carbide, Baltimore Recycling,
and Southeast Recycling. (Tr. 100-106). Eagle may also have marketed District recyclables to
Society Plastic, ERI, Georgetown Paper, Welman, Inc., but Tynes could not recall for sure although
he indicated that Eagle maintained a file indicating entities to whom it sells reyclables and the
revenue derived from its sales. (Tr. 104-105). Despite ordering the production of such files, it is not
clear that Eagle provided complete documentation of its marketing. The OIG auditors discovered
from the records produced to them that Eagle had underreported market revenue by $14,496. RSI
independently investigated Eagle’s market vendors and states that Eagle underreported $92,250 in
market revenue. (RSI Reply Brief, Ex. A).

       If collected materials were not recyclable, or recyclable material was too contaminated to
market, then Eagle arranged with a hauler like CWI to dispose of this bypass material at a landfill.
(Tr. 112-113).

       Ms. Hallie Clemm, an employee with DPW, was responsible for monitoring Eagle’s
performance and authorizing progress payments. (Tr. 126). She prepared a spreadsheet listing on a
monthly basis the amount of District recyclables delivered by DPW trucks to Eagle, the amount of
newspaper, aluminum, plastic, steel, and glass marketed by Eagle, the amount of unmarketable
material, and the amount of material unaccounted for by Eagle. (HEX 1). The data was taken from
reports submitted by Eagle with its monthly invoices. Ms. Clemm made a summary of the
                                                    - 14 -           Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

III.     Determination of Actual Costs Pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2)
                                                 - 15 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377



       D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2) provides:

       If a contract is void, a contractor who has entered into the contract in good faith,
       without directly contributing to a violation and without knowledge of any violation
       of the chapter or rules and regulations prior to the awarding of the contract, shall be
       compensated for costs actually incurred.

        We have interpreted the language “costs actually incurred” as meaning that the contractor is
entitled to be compensated for its costs that are properly allocable to the work, are reasonably
incurred, and are allowable under the applicable cost principles. The actual costs must be reasonable
costs. Otherwise, the District could end up paying more than even contemplated under the purported
contract. The Council could not have intended any other meaning for actual costs because the
purpose of the provision is to free the innocent contractor from the rigors of a forfeiture, not to
provide a windfall to a contractor whose contract is determined to be invalid. In determining the
reasonableness of costs, we also consider the contractor’s proposed cost and pricing data submitted
in response to the solicitation. In the competitive sealed proposals used in this procurement, Eagle
submitted in its cost proposal and BAFOs various cost and pricing data schedules. For what was
contemplated as a fixed unit price contract, if Eagle performed inefficiently or otherwise performed
its work in such a manner that it would have incurred a loss on the job, Eagle should not be able to
avoid its losses for which it is responsible simply because the contract was declared void ab initio.
Stated differently, the actual cost recovery provided by D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2) is not a pure cost
reimbursement remedy. Indeed, even under the convenience termination measure of costs, which is
more generous than the actual cost measure of D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2), a contractor’s recovery
is reduced by applying a loss ratio in the situation where the contractor would have incurred a loss
on the contract.

        The actual costs must be allocable to the performance of the purported contract work, which
is defined by the Statement of Work. Costs incurred in performing added work that would have
constituted a valid change under the Changes article of the contract -- but for the fact that the
contract was void ab initio -- may also be recoverable, depending on the circumstances. Besides the
usual factors to be considered in the context of a valid contract, we must also consider whether the
performance of added work is reasonable when measured against the contractor's knowledge of the
validity of the contract. For example, it is relevant here to consider Eagle's performance (and cost
documentation) in light of its knowledge by October 1993 that its contract might be terminated, and,
by April 1994, that the Board had declared the contract void ab initio.

        In analyzing costs, the OIG auditors looked to see whether Eagle was able to support items of
cost with vendor invoices, Eagle vouchers which would indicate the proper cost account for charging
the costs, and evidence of payment by Eagle. Generally, OIG would find the cost supported if at
least two of the three records existed. The OIG auditors conducted an audit of incurred costs, but
did not attempt to conduct a review of Eagle’s performance under the invalid contract. (Tr. 729-730;
HEX 65B, at 3). In describing the scope and methodology of its review of direct and indirect costs
claimed by Eagle, the OIG stated in pertinent part:

       The direct cost audit scope was limited to test procedures for validating Eagle’s
                                                 - 16 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

       claimed costs by tracing them to books of original entry and supporting records. We
       tested specific transactions, but did not evaluate Eagle’s total internal control system
       or technical aspects of its performance. The direct productive manhours scope was
       limited to reviewing timesheets to determine total direct productive manhours. The
       indirect cost audit scope was limited to tests of indirect costs and costs comprising
       the allocation bases. In addition, we evaluated the appropriateness of the allocation
       methods used.

       Our audit included assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
       made by Eagle. Criteria used in evaluating the claimed costs also included cost
       principles set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), District of
       Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR), and Cost Accounting Statndards (CAS).

(HEX 65A, at 3).

       Although the OIG auditors did not have the benefit of the results of the evidentiary hearing
and additional data collected during the proceedings which occurred after its final audit report,
including the examination and cross-examination of the Eagle representatives, we have found the
OIG audit reports and supporting workpapers to be very helpful in our assessment of Eagle’s costs
and the our ultimate determination of actual costs under D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2).

        As we made clear during the evidentiary hearing, we went beyond the sample testing
conducted by the OIG auditors, analyzing all items of cost claimed by Eagle under the District
recycling job, and examining all supporting data (including original invoices, vouchers, payment
records, cost and revenue reports, labor data) offered by Eagle. We also reviewed all of the
performance data produced by the parties, including recycling reports, correspondence, and
documentation relating to the invalid contract. Our specific findings concerning allowability and
allocability are addressed in connection with each category of cost considered: labor, labor burden,
other direct costs, subcontract costs, costs for Eagle’s new recycling facility, and general and
administrative costs.

IV.    Eagle's Allowable Actual Costs

       A.      Eagle Direct Labor Costs

        In its 1996 cost submission, Eagle claimed direct labor costs of $978,659.72 for the period
February 1993 through September 1994, consisting of $127,083.34 in “temporary labor” (casual
laborers Eagle alleges it paid in cash) and $851,576 (derived from Eagle's monthly "Labor
Distribution Summary Reports" ("LDSRs") (Eagle Exs. 1-20)). For the period beginning in mid-
September 1994 through May 1995, Eagle claims another $363,232 in labor incurred by its affiliated
company, Eagle Management. These labor costs from Eagle Management do not appear under
Eagle’s direct labor schedules because Eagle has sought to recover all of the various costs incurred
by Eagle Management under the subcontractor costs category, i.e., Eagle treats Eagle Management
as a subcontractor on the District recycling job and its costs as subcontract costs. For purposes of
the District recycling job, OIG determined that Eagle Maintenance and Eagle Management are from
a functional and operational standpoint just one company, because the two entities are wholly owned
                                                  - 17 -         Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

by Mr. Tynes, and they share the same G&A staff, office space, warehouse, and processing facility.
(HEX 65A, at 3-4, 9). Based on our review of the testimony and record, we agree with OIG’s
determination and find that Eagle Management and Eagle Maintenance operated as one company.

       Temporary Labor Costs

      OIG disallowed the entire amount of the temporary labor costs of $127,083.34 as
unsupported. Eagle has agreed with OIG’s disallowance. (HEX 65A, at 6, note A.1.).

       Labor Distribution Costs (Feb. 1993 – mid-Sept. 1994)

         A review of Eagle’s LDSR reports shows that for most of the 1993, the claimed direct labor
was coded to Eagle's project Account No. 3032-000-39, entitled "Waste Mgmt-Direct Labor." Eagle
states that prior to the District recycling job, it had used the 3032 account to collect Eagle’s labor
costs for processing recyclables collected from PG County under a subcontract with Waste
Management. We are told that this processing work ended late in 1992, but in any event, prior to the
start of the District recycling job. It was not until December 1993 that Eagle created a new account,
No. 3800-000-39, entitled “DC Recycling,” to collect the District recycling labor costs. (Eagle Ex.
12). Eagle was unable to produce to the OIG auditors the personnel files for the persons charging
labor to the District job, stating that they were lost in the July 1993 fire. We find this excuse
unpersuasive because more than 85 percent of the labor was incurred after the fire on July 2,1993.
Although OIG apparently did not review any personnel files and time cards, OIG’s analysis of the
LDSRs for the period February 1993 through mid-September 1994 did not alert them to any obvious
mischarging of labor. Although the OIG may have relied on Mr. Tynes’ affidavit (stating that Eagle
had no other recycling jobs involving processing of recyclable materials) for its assumption that
Eagle’s labor was properly charged to the District recycling job, we find based on the hearing
testimony and the documentation in the record that Eagle collected recyclable materials from its
other janitorial and recycling jobs, and processed nearly all of those materials at the Capitol Heights
facility by the laborers who were charging to the District recycling job. While Mr. Tynes testified
that the amount was very small and no more than 1 percent of the total recyclables, we find it more
likely than not that the figure was at least 5 percent of total recyclables.

       Labor Costs Charged by Eagle Management (mid-Sept. 1994 – May 1995)

        After mid-September 1994, Eagle began accumulating labor costs and other District (and PG
County) recycling costs through its affiliated entity, Eagle Management. Eagle Management records
of labor were also incomplete. Eagle produced “time sheet edit” reports for some months, payroll
registers for some months, and “payroll hours/earnings” reports for other months. (E.g., Eagle Exs.
29-45, 59). OIG did not have actual time sheets or personnel files for its auditing procedures and did
not interview any of the laborers. Between mid-September and December 1994, OIG determined
that Eagle had incurred $166,484 in direct labor. (HEX 66T, at 16). Between January 1995 and
April 1995, OIG determined that Eagle had incurred $166,289 in direct labor. (Id.). OIG initially
disallowed $29,234 in labor for May 1995, but later allowed that amount on Eagle’s representation
that DPW had delivered recyclables to its facility up to the end of April. Based on the volume of
deliveries in the latter part of April, we allow half of the May 15 payroll amount, that is, $9,697 and
disallow the remainder. As we found with regard to Eagle’s labor for the period February 1993
                                                  - 18 -         Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

through mid-September 1994, at least 5 percent of the recyclables processed at the interim facility
during the mid-September 1994 through the beginning of May 1995 were generated from Eagle’s
other recycling and janitorial jobs and from commercial haulers.

       Allocable and Allowable Direct Labor Costs

        Based on our findings above, 95 percent of Eagle’s direct labor costs of $1,194,046
($851,576+$166,484+$166,289+$9,697) should be allocated to the District recycling job. Thus, we
find that Eagle’s allocable direct labor for the District recycling job equals $1,134,344. Considering
that Eagle performed the equivalent of approximately 25 full months of work on the District
recycling job (April 1993 through April 1995, since the quantity of recyclables for February through
April 1993 equal almost one full month), Eagle had a direct labor average of $45,374 per month.
We find this to be unreasonable. Eagle’s BAFO proposed direct labor (including project
management) of $408,444 (monthly average of $34,037) for the first year and $424,455 (monthly
average of $35,371) for the second year. Eagle’s actual direct labor exceeds its proposed amount by
$301,445, almost 30 percent. We find three primary reasons for the actual labor to be significantly
higher than the proposed labor costs: (1) the extra effort entailed in separating the newspaper from
the other commingled materials; (2) Eagle’s recycling operation entailed significantly less automated
procedures and systems than Eagle had stated in its proposal and that were required by the statement
of work; and (3) by processing at its Capitol Heights facility and CWI’s Olive Street facility, Eagle
labor was inefficiently committed to the recycling work and often involved Eagle transferring
recyclable materials between the two facilities with the attendant additional handling costs. We find
that Eagle and the District bear equal responsibility for the added labor costs. Accordingly, of the
$301,445 of labor beyond Eagle’s BAFO cost and pricing data which were a component directly
supporting the invalid contract’s unit prices, $150,722.50 should be the responsibility of the District
and $150,722.50 should be the responsibility of Eagle. Based on this assignment, Eagle is entitled to
recover $983,622 for allowable labor costs under D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2).

       B.      Eagle Labor Fringe Benefits Cost

        Eagle's BAFO identifies a labor burden rate of 22 percent consisting of FICA (7.65%),
FUTA (.80%), SUTA (2.50%), worker’s compensation (5.50%), and liability insurance (5.55%).
Total labor burden costs for the base year were estimated at $89,857.77, based on a direct labor base
of $408,444.40. (PCX 21).

         In its 1996 submission, Eagle claimed fringe benefits totaling $325,759, for the period
February 1993 through mid-September 1994 using the temporary labor and labor distribution as the
direct labor base. For the remaining period of September 1994 through April of 1995, Eagle’s fringe
benefit costs are subsumed in the $1,000,851 claimed by Eagle as subcontract costs charged by
Eagle Management.

       Of the $325,759 in claimed fringe benefits, OIG disallowed $137,646, consisting of the
component of fringe benefits relating to the disallowed temporary labor and nearly all of the
amounts that Eagle claimed for vacation, sick, and holiday leave for the reason that Eagle, with one
exception (one supervisor earned $1,166 in leave during the performance period), never paid leave
amounts to its workers on the District recycling job. (HEX 65A, at 5, 7, 8-9). Thus, OIG allowed a
                                                  - 19 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

total of $188,113 in fringe benefit costs on the labor distribution ($851,576) base. Applying the
ratio of allowable total direct labor ($983,622) to the total direct labor base used by OIG
($1,134,344), to OIG’s fringe benefit figure of $188,113 (for the period 1993 through mid-
September 1994), we find that allowable fringe benefit costs equal $163,118.

        Based on our review of the income statements for Eagle Management for the periods
September through December 1994 (HEX 66T) and January through May 1995 (HEX 66U), we find
unadjusted total fringe benefits of $40,784 and $80,498 for the respective periods. These figures
must first be adjusted to account for Eagle Management’s two projects (the District recycling job
and the PG County recycling job). By applying ratios of District recycling labor to PG County
recycling labor for each of those periods, we find the District recycling job’s share of fringe benefits
to be $27,765 and $49,289, for a total of $77,054. This amount must be further adjusted to account
for the unallowable portion of labor for which Eagle is responsible. By applying the ratio of
allowable total direct labor ($983,622) to the total direct labor base used by OIG ($1,134,344), we
find the allowable and allocable share of fringe benefits to be $66,816 for the period September 1994
through the beginning of May 1995. Based on the adjusted labor base for that period of $296,965
($342,470 times the ratio for accounting for unallowable labor), the fringe benefit rate comes to
approximately 22.5 percent, which is consistent with the 22 percent we found allowable for the labor
distribution base covering the period February 1993 through mid-September 1994. Both rates are
consistent with the 22 percent rate set forth in Eagle’s BAFO.

      In sum, we find that Eagle is entitled to allocable and allowable fringe benefits costs of
$229,934 for the entire performance period pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2).

       C.       Eagle's Other Direct Costs

        Eagle has claimed other direct costs (“ODCs”) totaling $654,856, consisting of $605,052,
summarized on Schedules 2, 2A, 3, and 3A of Eagle’s June 3, 1996 cost submission, and additional
ODCs of $49,804 claimed by Eagle which are subsumed in the “subcontract” costs of Eagle
Management, for the period of late 1994 through April 1995. Eagle’s Schedule 2 and 3 claimed
costs, OIG accepted costs, and OIG questioned costs are as follows:

       As discussed below, we find total allocable and allowable ODCs pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-
1182.5(d)(2) of $353,635.

       Material & Supplies

       In its BAFO, Eagle’s estimated costs for materials and supplies are listed under the
“Supplies” category within the Other Direct Costs schedule. (PCX 21, Cost and Pricing Data, Years
1-5, Schedule 3). Eagle estimated $5,618 per year for such costs. For the actual two-year
performance period, Eagle claims a total of $56,015 for material and supplies, consisting of
$31,660.67 in 1993, $13,866.58 for the period January through October1994, and, subsumed within
Eagle Management’s “subcontract” costs, $3,057 for the period September through December 1994,
and $7,431 for the period January through April 1995.

        In support of the claimed material and supplies costs in its 1996 cost submission, Eagle
furnished the following: Schedule 2, which lists monthly totals for 1993; Schedule 2A, which lists
the monthly amounts by supplier; Schedule 3, which lists monthly totals for 1994 (through October);
and Schedule 3A, which lists the monthly amounts by supplier. (HEX 65B, Appendix 1). Eagle
collected costs for these items under its internal cost account numbers 3800-000-44 and 3032-000-
44. The costs claimed through Eagle Management are summarized in the September-December
1994 and January-May 1995 income statements and attached “Detail Trial Balance” sheets. (HEX
66T, 66U).

        OIG relied on auditing of a random sampling conducted by KPMG, a subcontractor retained
by OIG to perform auditing of Eagle’s costs, of only 9 items of materials and supplies claimed by
Eagle in 1993, 8 items relating to Account 3800 (the DC recycling job account) and 1 item relating
to Account 3032. KPMG found 4 of the 9 randomly selected cost items to be unsupported. (HEX
66C; Tr. 699-717). Neither KPMG nor OIG did any further testing. Based on our review of the
invoice records, KPMG’s and OIG’s analyses, and testimony relating to the material and supplies
costs claimed for 1993 and 1994, we find that 2 of the remaining sample are also not properly
recoverable or not adequately supported in the record. First, Eagle claims $1,717.80 paid to Count
Recycling which was the portion of a $37,000 amount for a capital repair not reimbursed by Eagle’s
                                                  - 21 -         Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

insurance carrier after a fire damaged Eagle’s Capitol Heights facility (HEX 66E; Tr.201, 710-712).
 Eagle’s CFO identified a threshold of $2,500 for capitalizing rather than expensing a cost item. (Tr.
201). Thus, if Eagle incurred a cost that was properly capitalized, then it cannot charge the full
amount as a direct cost for the period in which it was incurred. The OIG auditors disallowed
depreciation as an item of actual cost under D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2). In any event, Eagle did not
establish the useful life for capital items and other information concerning allocation, so there is no
basis for us to consider whether to allow a share of such costs. Second, we find $1,638.33 paid to
American Express for various purchases by Noel Perez (HEX 66C; Tr. 204-207) because the record
shows Perez did not make purchases exclusively for the District recycling job and Eagle did not
demonstrate that the claimed purchases related to the District job. (E.g., HEX 66T, at 6; June 30,
1997 Eagle Filing, Doc. No. 1 (PG job invoices)). Although we might disallow all material and
supplies based on the results of the 9 randomly selected cost items, from our further review of
original records – to the extent that they exist – including the original invoice records, voucher
forms, and related documentation, in conjunction with Eagle’s Schedules 2A and 3A, we are able to
find adequate documentary support for the following costs: Carter Fuel Oil ($1,451), Suburban
Propane ($735), Direct Safety ($1,861), Maurice Electric ($631), Galanes Boxes ($4,365), Erin
Supply ($2,434), Colliflower, Inc. ($1,222), Hydra Lift ($1,340) (original invoice and voucher
documentation supports $1,340 rather than Eagle’s Schedule 2A claim amount of $1,242), Yadgi &
Co. ($255), Hoffman Equipment ($3,804), Metro Rental ($214), National Capitol Industry ($352),
Recycling, Inc. ($450), Grainger ($276), Steel & Wire Products ($586), Beltway Ford ($104),
Structural Inst. ($78), and ACME ($110). Other claimed costs are not properly supported. The
unadjusted total of supported costs for materials and supplies equals $20,268, which after deducting
5 percent for the allocable share of such costs on other recycling work performed at the Capitol
Heights facility, yields allowable and allocable materials and supplies of $19,255.

        For the materials and supplies costs incurred by Eagle Management, we find adequate
documentary support for the following costs: Steel Wire Products ($603), Colliflower, Inc. ($200),
Erin Supply Co. ($469) (2 items totaling $405.48 were disallowed because the purchase orders show
that they were for both the“PG [County] [and] DC” recycling jobs and were not allocated), Galanes
Boxes ($3,110), and Direct Safety ($152). The unadjusted total of supported costs for materials and
supplies equals $4,534, which after deducting 5 percent for the allocable share of such costs on other
recycling work performed at the Capitol Heights facility, yields allowable and allocable materials
and supplies of $4,307.

        Apparently, neither KPMG nor OIG in its review of KPMG’s work, analyzed the
undifferentiated claim amounts under the category of “Other” or “Other Reimbursements” found on
Eagle’s Schedules 2A and 3A. Pursuant to Board request, Eagle submitted separate documentation
to support certain miscellaneous claimed amounts for materials and supplies listed as “Other” or
“Other Reimbursements” on Eagle’s Schedules 2A and 3A. For the material and supplies cost
account 3800-000-44, Eagle identifies costs of $1,361.19. We find that the contemporaneous
portions of the documentation for these cash transactions do not adequately show that the costs were
incurred solely for the District recycling job or paid by Eagle. We find the amounts neither allocable
nor allowable.

       The costs involved in this materials and supplies category do not appear to be the type that
would be affected by Eagle’s inadequate facilities and the inefficiencies in conducting the processing
                                                   - 22 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

operation at multiple locations and in hauling materials between locations. Accordingly, we make
no deductions and find the total allowable and allocable costs for materials and supplies is $23,562.

        Fuel, Maintenance, Transportation

        In its BAFO, Eagle’s proposed costs related to fuel, maintenance, and transportation under
the “Repair and Maintenance” category within the Other Direct Costs schedule. (PCX 21, Cost and
Pricing Data, Years 1-5, Schedule 3). Eagle proposed $18,000 per year for such costs. For the
actual two-year performance period, Eagle claims a total of $319,983 for fuel, maintenance, and
transportation, consisting of $26,399.24 in 1993, $277,035 for the approximate period of January
through October1994, and, subsumed within Eagle Management’s “subcontract” costs, $7,102 for
the period September through December 1994, and $9,447 for the period January through April
1995.

        In support of its claimed fuel, maintenance, and transportation costs, Eagle furnished with its
1996 claim letter the following: Schedule 2, which lists monthly totals for 1993, Schedule 2A,
which lists the monthly amounts by supplier, Schedule 3, which lists monthly totals for 1994 (the
bulk of the costs through August), and Schedule 3A, which lists the monthly amounts by supplier.
(HEX 65B, Appendix 1). Eagle collected costs for these items under its internal cost account
numbers 3800-000-43 and 3032-000-43. The costs claimed through Eagle Management are
summarized in the September-December 1994 and January-May 1995 income statements and
attached “Detail Trial Balance” sheets. (HEX 66T, 66U).

         OIG relied on auditing of a random sampling conducted by KPMG of 20 items of fuel,
maintenance, and transportation costs claimed by Eagle in 1993 and 1994. KPMG found all 20
randomly selected cost items to be supported. (HEX 66C, 66K; Tr. 694). The OIG auditor stated
that to verify that the fuel charges related to the District recycling job rather than another Eagle job,
she relied, for example, on Eagle’s representation that Noel Perez signed for the fuel and that “he
only drove a truck for the D.C. recycling job . . . .” (Tr. 695-696). As we have discussed earlier, at
the hearing, Eagle’s representative conceded that Mr. Perez made acquisitions for other Eagle jobs
besides the District recycling job. (Tr. 204-207). The documentary evidence bears that out. (E.g.,
HEX 66T, at 6). Based on our review of the invoice records, KPMG’s and OIG’s analyses, and
testimony relating to the fuel, maintenance, and transportation costs claimed on Schedule 2A for
1993, we find the 1993 costs, prior to the allocation adjustment, are supported in the amount of
$25,452. The items of cost for the category of “Other” are unsupported. Based on our review of the
invoice records, KPMG’s and OIG’s analyses, and testimony relating to the fuel, maintenance, and
transportation costs claimed on Schedule 3A for 1994, we find that those 1994 costs totaling
$196,869 are supported as follows: D&D Tires ($111), Friend’s Tire ($8,340), Suburban Propane
($2,471), Macks, Inc. ($861), Brent Trucking ($48,300 consisting of 3/10/94 invoice no. 6133
($38,400), 4/25/94 invoice no. 6339 ($8,700), and 6/25/94 invoice no. 6797 ($1,200)), Fannon
Petroleum ($1,412), CWI ($131,524), and MGM Transportation ($3,850). The CWI invoices
charged to cost account 3800-000-43 were supportable for the following amounts which total
$146,138: invoice no. 5114 ($2221.76), invoice no. 5115 ($4,320), invoice no. 5116 ($1,050),
invoice no. 5112 ($2,250), invoice no. 5251 ($10,710), invoice no. 5254 ($1,414), invoice no. 5253
($0), invoice no. 5377 ($1,270.50), invoice no. 5376 ($7,191), invoice no. 5375 ($22,860), invoice
no. 5500 ($1,113), invoice no. 5115 ($4,320), invoice no. 5499 ($23,495), invoice no. 5498
                                                 - 23 -         Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

($16,730), invoice no. 5636 ($1,193), invoice no. 5635 ($23,469.40), and invoice no. 5634
($22,530). We disallow 10 percent of these CWI costs, resulting in allowable CWI costs of
$131,524, due to the inefficiencies of Eagle’s operation which resulted in additional hauling of
recyclables between Eagle’s Capitol Heights facility and the CWI facility it was using at Olive
Street. The items of cost for “AMEX – Fuel”, Nations Bank, Waste Management (not shown to be
dedicated to the District job, see HEX 66U, Detail Trial Balance, at 33), and the category of “Other”
are unsupported. The costs for fuel, maintenance, and transportation in 1993 and 1994 equals
$222,321, which after deducting 5 percent for the allocable share of such costs on other recycling,
yields allowable and allocable fuel, maintenance, and transportation costs of $211,205.

        For the fuel, maintenance, and transportation costs incurred by Eagle Management in 1994,
we find adequate documentary support for the following costs: MGM Brokerage Service ($3,100)
and Count Recycling Systems ($3,371). The unadjusted total of supported costs for fuel,
maintenance, and transportation equals $6,471, which after deducting 5 percent for the allocable
share of such costs on other recycling work, yields allowable and allocable fuel, maintenance, and
transportation of $6,147. For the fuel, maintenance, and transportation costs incurred by Eagle
Management in 1995, we find adequate documentary support for the costs totaling $9,447, which
after deducting 5 percent for the allocable share of such costs on other recycling work, yields
allowable and allocable fuel, maintenance, and transportation of $8,975. Total allowable and
allocable fuel, maintenance, and transportation costs listed under Eagle Management equals $15,446.

       In sum, total allowable and allocable fuel, maintenance, and transportation costs for Eagle
equals $226,651.

       Equipment Rental/Repair

        In its BAFO, Eagle’s proposed yearly costs of $108,000 related to equipment within the
Other Direct Costs schedule. (PCX 21, Cost and Pricing Data, Years 1-5, Schedule 3). In the
BAFO, equipment repair probably was included in the “Repair and Maintenance” category. Thus,
there is not a precise match between BAFO cost categories of “Repair and Maintenance” and
“Equipment” with the costs accounts, “Fuel, Maintenance, and Transportation” and “Equipment
Rental/Repair,” actually used by Eagle during performance. For the actual two-year performance
period, Eagle claims a total of $149,493 for equipment rental/repair, consisting of $72,475 in 1993,
$68,037 for the period of January through November 1994, and, subsumed within Eagle
Management’s “subcontract” costs, $4,478 for the period September through December 1994, and
$4,503 for the period January through April 1995.

         In support of its claimed equipment rental/repair costs, Eagle furnished with its 1996 claim
letter the following: Schedule 2, which lists monthly totals for 1993, Schedule 2A, which lists the
monthly amounts by supplier, Schedule 3, which lists monthly totals for 1994), and Schedule 3A,
which lists the monthly amounts by supplier. (HEX 65B, Appendix 1). Eagle collected costs for
these items under its internal cost account numbers 3800-000-45 and 3032-000-45. The costs
claimed through Eagle Management are summarized in the September-December 1994 and January-
May 1995 income statements and attached “Detail Trial Balance” sheets. (HEX 66T, 66U).

       OIG relied on auditing of a random sampling conducted by KPMG of 19 items of equipment
                                                  - 24 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

rental/repair costs claimed by Eagle in 1993 and 1994. KPMG found 17 of the 19 cost items to be
supported. (HEX 66C, 66K). The two disallowed items were charges to American Express Green
totaling $7,310. (HEX 66K; 65A, at 5). The OIG auditors in their review disallowed one more of
the 19 items selected, a $20,000 cost paid to Gershman, Grickman & Bratton, Inc. (“GBB”) (see
Eagle Schedule 2A; HEX 66G), which was not for equipment rental but rather for consulting on the
new intermediate processing facility. (Tr. 735-736; 213-214). OIG separately determined that all
costs relating to the design and construction of Eagle’s new District-based processing facility were
unallowable. OIG thus agreed with KPMG that 16 of the 19 randomly selected items were
allowable.

        Based on our review of the random sample, we find the following additional items
unallowable: (i) the amount of $10,842.10 paid to Mid-Atlantic Waste Systems for “glass crusher(s)
machinery” is unallowable because the cost is not a rental cost but a capital acquisition that
benefited Eagle beyond the District recycling job and for which Eagle has provided no basis for
allocation (HEX 66G; Tr. 212-213); (ii) the amount of $3,975.74 paid to NationsBank of Delaware
based on a statement listing an annual fee, a “Transfer Misapplied Pymt”, four unspecified charges
from Beltsville Rental, a prior balance credit of $390.01, and a payment of $2,692.83. Thus, we find
5 of the 19 randomly selected items, totaling $42,128, to be unallowable.

        Based on our review of the invoice records, KPMG’s and OIG’s analyses, and testimony
relating to the equipment rental/repair costs claimed on Schedule 2A and 3A for 1993 and 1994, we
find costs, prior to the allocation adjustment, are supported as follows: Count Recycling ($64,040);
Orix Credit ($2,012); Suburban Propane ($43); Hydra Lift ($935); Colonial Pacific ($4,637); Oxon
Hill Rental ($3,451); and Metro Rental ($7,707). The 3 invoice charges for Idealease ($915) were
disallowed because although the vouchers charge the 3 invoices to the District recycling job, the 2
invoices that have the rental agreement attached list the drivers as Vaundervilt C. Simmons and
Lawrence Maynard. These two individuals were drivers for the PG County recycling job during that
time period. (Eagle Ex. 11, at 43, 56; Eagle Ex. 12, at 45, 58). The costs claimed for Toyota Motor,
Waste Management AMEX, Nations Bank, and the category of “Other” are unsupported and thus
unallowable. The unadjusted costs for equipment rental/repair in 1993 and 1994 equal $82,825,
which after deducting 5 percent for the allocable share of such costs on other recycling jobs, yields
allowable and allocable equipment rental/repair costs of $78,684.

        For the equipment rental/repair costs incurred by Eagle Management in 1994 and 1995, we
find adequate documentary support for the claimed costs of $8,981 which after deducting 5 percent
for the allocable share of such costs on other recycling jobs, yields allowable and allocable
equipment rental/repair costs listed under Eagle Management of $8,532. The equipment
rental/repair costs do not appear to be the type that would be affected by Eagle’s inadequate facilities
and the inefficiencies in conducting the processing operation at multiple locations and in hauling
materials between locations.

       In sum, total allowable and allocable equipment rental/repair costs for Eagle equals $87,216.



       Other Direct Costs (Subcategory)
                                                 - 25 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377



        Eagle did not include in its BAFO cost schedules a subcategory of “Other Direct Costs”
within the general category of “Other Direct Costs.” For the actual two-year performance period,
Eagle claims a total of $96,392 for the ODCs subcategory, consisting of $33,389 in 1993, $49,217
for the period of January through November1994, and, subsumed within Eagle Management’s
“subcontract” costs, $10,172 for the period September through December 1994, and $3,614 for the
period January through April 1995.

        In support of its claimed ODC costs, Eagle furnished with its 1996 claim letter the following:
 Schedule 2, which lists monthly totals for 1993, Schedule 2A, which lists the monthly amounts by
supplier, Schedule 3, which lists monthly totals for 1994, and Schedule 3A, which lists the monthly
amounts by supplier. (HEX 65B, Appendix 1). Eagle collected costs for these items under its
internal cost account numbers 3800-000-49 and 3032-000-49. The costs claimed through Eagle
Management are summarized in the September-December 1994 and January-May 1995 income
statements and attached “Detail Trial Balance” sheets. (HEX 66T, 66U).

       OIG relied on auditing of a random sampling conducted by KPMG of 18 items of ODC costs
claimed by Eagle in 1993 and 1994. KPMG found 10 of the 18 cost items to be supported. (HEX
66C, 66K). The auditors disallowed items from Wamo Welding, American Express Green,
Overhead Door, and Robert McCall, in the total amount of $20,770.

       Based on our review of the random sample, we find the amounts of $8,000 and $4,609 paid
to Design-Build Contracting for roof repairs, $4,700 paid to Wamo Welding for welding at the
Capitol Heights facility, and $5,500 paid to Nathan Dorsey, to be unallowable because those costs
are capital improvements that benefited Eagle beyond the District recycling job. (HEX 66C; Tr.
215-217).

        Based on our review of the invoice records, KPMG’s and OIG’s analyses, and testimony
relating to the ODCs claimed on Schedule 2A and 3A for 1993 and 1994, we find costs charged to
the ODC accounts 3800-000-49 and 3032-000-49, prior to the allocation adjustment, are supported
as follows: First Page ($166.50); District International ($226.66); McLean Rental ($241.43);
Hirrlinger Electric ($1,823.43) ($173.25 deducted because amount erroneously charged to the
District recycling job); D&D Tire ($236.98), Paradise Unlimited ($433.58); Hydra Lift
($11,997.22); Bay Scale ($9,399); Strickland Fire ($2,040); and Simplex ($90.05). (HEX 66C, 66D,
66K, 66I, 66J, 66P). The costs claimed for Design-Build Contracting, Wamo, AMEX, Nations
Bank, Pepco, Bernie Ind., WSSC, Mid-Atlantic Waste Systems, Robert McCall, Overhead Door, and
the categories of “Other” are unsupported and unallowable. We have reduced the credit amount of
$29,085.39 appearing in the 1993 account 3800-000-49 “Other” category by $15,875.21, the sum of
the claim amounts for that category, since we have found the claim amounts unsupported and
unallowable. In sum, the unadjusted costs for ODCs in 1993 and 1994 equal $13,445, which after
deducting 5 percent for the allocable share of such costs on other Eagle jobs, yields allowable and
allocable ODCs of $12,773.

        For the claimed ODCs incurred by Eagle Management in 1994 and 1995, we find adequate
support in the record for the costs of ABC Burglar Alarm ($81.90), which after deducting 5 percent
for the allocable share of such costs on other recycling jobs, yields allowable and allocable ODCs
                                                 - 26 -         Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

listed under Eagle Management of $78. We find the remaining claimed costs, including those for
invoices from Bell Atlantic, WSSC, Ernest Roland, Aundra Williams/DC Drop Off, and Adolphus
McLean, to be unsupported and unallowable. (HEX 66T, 66U, 66Z). The costs allowed in this
subcategory of ODCs do not appear to be the type that would be affected by Eagle’s inadequate
facilities and the inefficiencies in conducting the processing operation at multiple locations and in
hauling materials between locations. Therefore, we make no further deductions.

       In sum, total supported costs under the ODCs subcategory for Eagle equals $12,851.

       Uniforms

        Eagle claims costs of $3,532 relating to uniforms. Based on our review of the record, we
find the costs for uniforms to be supported, and after allocating 5 percent for other Eagle jobs, we
find allowable and allocable uniform costs in the amount of $3,355.

       Depreciation

       Eagle claimed depreciation costs of $29,355 on Schedule 3 for 1994. The OIG auditors
determined that depreciation was not an allowable cost and Eagle agreed with that determination.
(HEX 65A, at 7 (Note 3); Tr. 697-698, 726-728).

       D.      Eagle Subcontractor Costs

        Excluding the “subcontract” costs of $423,458 and $577,307 arising from Eagle
Management for September through December 1994 and January through May 1995, Eagle has
claimed subcontract costs of $675,215 summarized on Schedules 2 and 2A for 1993, and $176,193
summarized on Schedules 3 and 3A mainly for January through August 1994. When Eagle
transferred the District recycling job to Eagle Management, what before was Eagle Maintenance’s
labor, ODCs, and subcontract costs, became Eagle Management’s labor, ODCs, and subcontracts
costs. However, Eagle Management billed Eagle for all of these costs on a monthly basis and Eagle
Maintenance treated Eagle Management’s monthly billings as “subcontract” costs since it viewed
Eagle Management as a subcontractor. Thus, the $423,458 of “subcontract” costs claimed through
Eagle Management for September through December 1994 (HEX 66T), and $577,307 of
“subcontract” costs claimed through Eagle Management for January through May 1995 (HEX 66U),
contain not only the subcontract vendors but also Eagle Management’s labor, ODCs, “Overhead
Expenses”, and G&A expenses. In our earlier treatment of labor costs and ODCs, we have
disregarded the Eagle Management structure as a separate entity in accord with OIG’s similar
findings and instead, we extracted the labor and ODC components from Eagle Management records
and added them to the labor and ODCs generated by Eagle Maintenance so that each cost category
contains all labor and all ODCs regardless of whether it was incurred under Eagle Maintenance or
Eagle Management. To be consistent, we do the same with regard to subcontract costs.

       In order to isolate the true subcontract costs, we extract the subcontract costs from Eagle
Management’s income statements. The actual claimed subcontract costs (arising from the outside
vendors) are contained in Eagle Management cost account 42502 (entitled “Subcontractors DC
Recy”) for the District recycling job. Claimed subcontract costs for the period September through
                                                  - 27 -         Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

December 1994 appearing on Eagle Management’s income statement total $164,151.62. (HEX
66T). Claimed subcontract costs for the period January through May 1995 appearing on Eagle
Management’s income statement total $203,477.83. (HEX 66U). Accordingly, actual claimed
subcontract costs for the entire performance period from vendors outside of Eagle Maintenance and
Eagle Management total $1,219,038 (i.e., $675,215+$176,193+$164,152+$203,478).

        OIG, in its final audit report, questioned $35,000 of $851,408 subcontract costs for the period
1993 through approximately August 1994. OIG questioned none of $379,671 in subcontract costs
for the Eagle Management period of September 1994 through May 1995. OIG also disallowed a net
profit of $18,833 appearing on Eagle Management’s income statements for the period September
1994 through May 1995 because profit is unallowable under D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2). (HEX
65A, at 7 (note 5)). As discussed below, we find total allocable and allowable subcontract costs of
$563,854 pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2).

         Initially, the OIG auditors employed KPMG to audit subcontract costs. After reviewing the
initial OIG audit report, the Board was not satisfied with the level of documentation obtained from
Eagle and the level of auditing performed with regard to subcontracts. For example, neither KPMG
nor OIG was aware of the existence of Eagle’s recycling division and affiliated company, Eagle
Management, and that Eagle had transferred the District recycling job to this division in roughly
September 1994. (Tr. 801-802). We directed Eagle to produce copies of the subcontracts, invoices
and vouchers, and, for the two largest subcontractors, Eagle Management and CWI, we ordered the
production of additional documentation such as correspondence and additional cost records. We
directed the OIG to supplement its auditing to include analyzing whether Eagle’s claimed
subcontract costs were properly allocable to the District recycling job. OIG produced an interim
audit report and ultimately its final audit report. (HEX 65A). Some background is useful for
understanding how and why Eagle incurred subcontract costs and how Eagle accounted for such
incurred costs.

         For the period from late March 1993 through approximately September 1994, Eagle
Maintenance, the parent company, was the cost center for all costs incurred on the District recycling
job, its other recycling jobs (including the PG County hauling contract), and its janitorial jobs.
According to Eagle, in September 1994, Eagle Maintenance transferred its recycling jobs to its
affiliated company, Eagle Management. Thus, Eagle recycling workers were transferred for cost
purposes to Eagle Management. All labor, acquisitions, repairs, maintenance, and subcontracting for
recycling were recorded on the books of Eagle Management, although some residual ODCs were
recorded in the parent company’s cost accounts during the period September through December
1994. There were two principal recycling jobs showing accumulation of costs under Eagle
Management cost accounts, the District job and the PG County job. A third job, Waste
Management, also appears in the cost records. In line with what Eagle did during the period of April
1993 through September 1994, the District recycling job cost accounts continued to incur costs
under the ODC and subcontractor costs categories in support of Eagle’s other smaller recycling jobs.
 The cost allocations between the District job and the PG County job are more clearly seen in the
Eagle Management cost records during the period September 1994 through May 1995 than can be
discerned in Eagle Maintenance’s costs records for the period of approximately April 1993 through
September 1994.

       1.      Subcontracted Hauling Services

        For the entire two-year performance period, Eagle Maintenance and Eagle Management cost
records show collectively that subcontracted hauling services were the single largest category of
costs claimed on the District recycling job. The claimed costs for hauling, totaling $1,301,288, are
mainly captured under the subcontracts category, which accounted for $1,049,570 in claimed
hauling costs. In addition, as seen in the ODCs category discussed earlier, a significant amount of
subcontracted hauling costs were also charged under the ODC subcategory of fuel, maintenance, and
transportation. Total charges of $251,718, consisting of CWI ($175,360), Brent Trucking ($72,508),
and MGM Brokerage/Transport ($3,850), were made to this account. Of the $1,049,570 in hauling
costs charged to subcontracting costs accounts, $707,206 is charged under the subcontracting
accounts of the parent company, Eagle Maintenance, and the remaining $342,364 is charged to
subcontracting cost accounts of Eagle Management. The hauling amounts claimed under Eagle
Maintenance subcontracts cost accounts 3800-000-46 and 3032-000-46, totaling $707,206, are as
follows: CWI ($442,473), Brent Trucking ($95,100), Rogers Brothers ($80,775), Georgetown
Express ($67,375), MGM Brokerage/Transport ($10,243), Laidlaw ($9,468), and Waste
Management ($1,772). The hauling amounts claimed under Eagle Management subcontracts cost
account 42502 for September to December 1994 are limited to one subcontractor, CWI ($154,098).
The hauling amounts claimed under Eagle Management subcontracts cost account 42502 for January
to April 1995 are also limited to the same subcontractor, CWI ($188,266). Thus, the hauling costs
by vendor are as follows: CWI ($860,197, consisting of $784,837 charged as subcontract costs and
$175,360 charged as ODCs), Brent Trucking ($167,608, consisting of $95,100 charged as
subcontract costs and $72,508 charged as ODCs), Rogers Brothers ($80,775), Georgetown Express
($67,375), MGM Brokerage/Transport ($14,093, consisting of $10,243 charged as subcontract costs
and $3,850 charged as ODCs), Laidlaw ($9,468), and Waste Management ($1,772).

       Eagle’s BAFO cost and pricing data does not show any category for subcontract costs and
does not appear to have any hauling costs incorporated in its ODC category. (PCX 21, Schedule 3
for Years 1-5). Under the solicitation and contract, Eagle would have expected the need to haul and
dispose of approximately 15 percent of all recyclables collected because this was an estimated
percentage of recyclables that would be unmarketable and thus treated as trash, also known as
“bypass” in the industry’s parlance. Eagle also would have incorporated into its labor estimates the
manpower needed to sort the newspaper from the other collected recyclables and load the newspaper
onto District-provided trucks. For hauling non-paper recyclables to market, Eagle may have
assumed that it would have either the marketing source or a broker pick up the recyclables who
would in turn deduct the transportation cost from the market revenue provided to Eagle.

        To determine the reasonableness of the hauling costs claimed by Eagle, we must determine
the types of hauling for which Eagle contracted, the approximate amounts hauled, and reasonable
costs per ton for such hauling. The record reveals four main types of hauling which Eagle
subcontracted to various hauling contractors. First, was the hauling of newspaper from Eagle’s
Capitol Heights facility and CWI’s Olive Street facility to the District’s newspaper market, Capitol
Fiber. Second, Eagle contracted for the hauling of unmarketable materials to landfills. Third, Eagle
contracted a limited amount of hauling of non-paper recyclables to various markets. Fourth, Eagle
contracted with CWI to haul materials from the Olive Street facility to its Capitol Heights facility
and from its Capitol Heights facility to CWI’s Olive Street facility. Based on the data collected by
                                                  - 29 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

Ms. Hallie Clemm of DPW, we can determine the approximate tons of hauling that Eagle was
required to perform under the invalid contract and then compare that with the hauling it claims it
performed solely for the District job.

        First, we consider the hauling of newspaper to Capitol Fiber. Under the statement of work,
the District was responsible for hauling the newspaper from Eagle’s Capitol Heights facility to
Capitol Fiber, but, because of problems with the DPW truck fleet, the District was hauling only just
over one half of the newspaper to Capitol Fiber. During the first year of performance, Eagle
voluntarily transported the newspapers not being hauled by the District. During the second year of
performance, Eagle expected the District to pay Eagle for this extra service. We believe that Eagle
did not demand payment during the first year for such newspaper hauling because the District was
paying Eagle not only the $15 per ton newspaper transfer fee but also the full $60 per ton processing
fee on both newspaper and all other recyclables on the basis that since the District collected all
recyclables together without having separate compartments for newspapers and the other
recyclables, all the material was “commingled recyclables.” This separating was more than the
sorting and loading operation contemplated by the statement of work. Since contract payments have
no meaning in a determination under D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2), it would be unfair to find that
Eagle volunteered to provide the newspaper hauling in the first year without compensation. As we
previously found, Eagle had to haul to Capitol Fiber approximately 45 percent of the newspapers for
1993 and approximately 55 percent of the newspaper for the remaining performance period. Based
on the quantity of marketed newspapers, we previously found that Eagle thus had to transport to
Capitol Fiber 4,681 tons of newspaper during 1993 and 11,821 tons of newspaper during the
remainder of the performance period. Thus, Eagle subcontracted for the hauling of approximately
16,502 tons of newspaper to the paper market, mainly Capitol Fiber, during the entire performance
period. It also appears from the record that Eagle subcontracted with CWI to perform a substantial
majority of this newspaper hauling. (HEX 65B, Appendix 1, Attachment 1 (June 28, 1996 letter
from Paul D. Furby to Mahamad K. Yusuff); Tr. 52).

         Second, we consider the amount of unmarketable materials/bypass that Eagle had to have
hauled away for disposal, either at a landfill or elsewhere. The record shows that for the entire
performance period, Eagle had to have haulers dispose of a total of 9,593 tons of unmarketable
recyclables. (HEX 1A). Third, there was a total of 9,779 tons of marketable materials other than
paper, consisting of 125 tons of marketed aluminum, 1,525 tons of marketed plastic, 63 tons of
marketed steel, and 8,066 tons of marketed glass. (HEX 1A). Eagle’s records do not show how
much of this material was transported to markets by Eagle subcontractors and how much was
transported to markets by the market entities themselves or by market brokers. Fourth, there was an
unknown quantity of materials hauled back and forth between Eagle’s Capitol Heights facility and
CWI’s Olive Street facility. Eagle’s records do not show how much material was hauled between
the facilities. The evidence shows that because of Eagle’s own facility problems it subcontracted
with CWI to perform hauling that in certain respects was very inefficient. A significant quantity of
DPW delivered materials were taken directly to CWI’s facility. It appears that Eagle personnel
separated the newspapers from the other commingled material. CWI would then transport the
newspaper to Capitol Fiber and the remaining material was hauled back to Eagle’s Capitol Heights
facility for processing because only Eagle’s facility had the mechanical sort lines. After processing,
Eagle might have CWI haul the unmarketable material back to CWI’s facility where it would be
loaded onto tractor trailers and then transported by CWI to a landfill or other disposal site. (Tr. 355-
                                                  - 30 -         Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

356, 371-372). Because Eagle’s facility as represented in its proposal should have been sufficient to
handle all of the DPW-delivered materials, but was not due to various facility and storage problems
and inefficiencies in the processing operations, we find that the portion of Eagle’s costs associated
with hauling between Eagle’s facility and CWI’s facility are unreasonable and unallowable costs
under D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2).

       CWI

        Eagle claims $784,837 in subcontract costs paid to CWI for services relating to the District
recycling job. In its June 28, 1996 response to an inquiry from the OIG auditors, Eagle described
CWI’s subcontract effort as involving “processing and transfer of newsprint, hauling newsprint,
hauling materials to market, and hauling by-pass for disposal.” In his hearing testimony, Eagle’s
Mr. Tynes denied that CWI personnel performed any processing at the CWI Olive Street facility.
Rather, Eagle used its own personnel to sort the paper from the other commingled recyclables and
CWI merely hauled the newspaper to Capitol Fiber.

         Mr. Tynes could not recall the specific subcontract arrangement or arrangements he had with
CWI. The written record indicates that there were several different arrangements during the 2-year
performance period. The first arrangement was evidenced by a written memorandum of
understanding (“MOU”) in May 1993 between Tynes of Eagle and Wilton Lash of CWI. Although
Tynes initially was not aware of any written agreement between Eagle and CWI, the agreement
surfaced during the proceedings. There were also other arrangements for pricing of various types of
hauling and weighing of trucks for the period from 1994 to 1995, but no documentation has been
produced clearly evidencing these arrangements. Some information concerning the arrangements
can be gathered from CWI’s invoices, Eagle’s markups of those invoices, and, with respect to tractor
trailer loads, a letter submitted by CWI with some of its invoices explaining the derivation of tractor
trailer pricing.

       1993 MOU Payments

         Eagle seeks $333,892 for payments to CWI pursuant to the May 1993 MOU under which
CWI received 5,137 tons of recyclables delivered by DPW during the period May through
September 1993. Based on the record documentation, approximately 67 percent of the 5,137 total
tons of recyclables delivered to CWI by DPW trucks during this period consisted of newspaper.
(HEX 12, 14). Thus, newspaper totaled 3,442 tons while non-paper recyclables totaled 1,695 tons.
As provided in the MOU, Eagle agreed to pay CWI $65 per ton for all recyclables received at the
Olive Street facility while Eagle would receive from CWI a “tipping fee” amount of $30 per ton for
the non-paper recyclables. Deducting the $30 tipping fee from the $65 per ton fee, for the non-paper
recyclables, results in a price of $35 per non-paper ton which Eagle paid to CWI. However, Eagle’s
Mr. Tynes stated that all labor associated with District recyclables was provided by Eagle
employees, not CWI employees. Eagle employees separated the newspaper from the non-paper
recyclables and the non-paper recyclables were hauled by CWI back to Eagle’s Capitol Heights
facility where Eagle employees processed the material. We find that the $35 price per ton for non-
paper recyclables represented a facility cost of $17 per ton charged by CWI for Eagle’s use of its
facility and a hauling cost of $18 per ton based on evidence showing that Eagle obtained
transportation of newspaper from CWI at $18 per ton for 30 yard pulls (e.g., $90 per 30 yard pull
                                                 - 31 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

holding about 5 tons). Eagle incurred the facility expense because of the various facility, equipment,
and personnel start-up difficulties described earlier that it encountered from March through
September 1993. Under the actual cost standard of D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2), the District is not
responsible for Eagle’s cost of using CWI’s facility under the circumstances presented here and such
costs are thus disallowed. Moreover, Eagle’s payment documentation shows the $65 per ton
payment from Eagle to CWI, but Eagle has not disclosed or made a credit for the $30 tipping fee
provided by CWI to Eagle under the MOU. The OIG auditors were not aware of the existence of the
MOU when they conducted their cost audit and did not investigate Eagle’s revenues for applying the
MOU credit. Thus, for the 1,695 tons of non-paper recyclables brought to Olive Street, we find that
Eagle is not entitled to hauling costs of $30,510 because Eagle should have been able to accept all
such materials at its own facility and the hauling from CWI to Eagle’s Capitol Heights facility is not
a reasonable cost for which the District should be responsible. Moreover, since processing was
performed by Eagle employees (separation at CWI’s facility and processing at Eagle’s facility) and
that labor has been accounted for under the direct labor costs discussed earlier, no additional labor
costs are recoverable by Eagle for these non-paper recyclables.

        For newspapers, Eagle also claims the full $65 per ton. Eagle was paying $65 per ton to
CWI for receiving the newspaper and transporting it to Capitol Fiber. According to Mr. Tynes’
testimony, CWI did not separate the newspaper from the non-paper recyclables since this was
performed by Eagle employees only. (Tr. 114-115). With regard to the $65 per ton fee for the
newspaper services, we similarly disallow an imputed amount of $17 per ton for CWI’s facility
costs. The remaining $48 per ton must be for the transportation of the newspaper to the paper
market because Mr. Tynes testified that only Eagle personnel performed the labor of separating the
newspaper from the non-paper. We find that $48 per ton for hauling newspaper is unreasonable.
The record shows that Eagle obtained transportation of newspaper from CWI and other venders for
between $8 per ton (e.g., $150 per tractor trailer load holding 110 cubic yards or about 18-20 tons)
and $18 per ton (e.g., $90 per 30 or 40 yard pull holding about 5 tons). We find a rate of $15 per ton
as a reasonable cost because CWI’s facility supported both tractor trailers and smaller containers.
CWI hauled approximately 3,442 tons of newspaper from the Olive Street facility to the paper
market, which at $15 per ton, equals a total hauling cost of $51,630.

       In sum, we find Eagle’s actual costs pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2) for subcontract
services by CWI under the May 1993 MOU during the period May through September 1993 equals
$51,630.

       Other CWI Invoice Payments by Eagle Maintenance for the period 1993-1994

        There is adequate record evidence to support the 30 yard, 40 yard, and 20 yard container
pulls by CWI found on the invoices. The record also supports costs for tractor trailer pulls and truck
weighing costs. (E.g., HEX 48). On the other hand, the invoices also contain various “service fees”
-- including “attempted pull” (apparently CWI came for a load but none was available), “wait time”
(CWI waiting extra time for load to be ready), and “tickets/violations” (presumably, traffic tickets
and the like) -- which we find to be unsupported and unallowable. (E.g., HEX 15-25, 26, 27-38).
We find the following CWI invoice amounts, totaling $68,065 to be supported by the record:
invoice no. 4637 ($8,623.61), invoice no. 4862 ($630), invoice no. 4984 ($90), invoice no. 4745
($1,350), invoice no. 4986 ($1769.60), invoice no. 4988 ($196), invoice no. 4987 ($4,230), invoice

no. 4049 ($8,760), invoice no. 4171 ($17,885), invoice no. 4285 ($8,760), invoice (adjusted) no.
4389 ($18,370), and invoice no. 4515 ($7,400.65). (HEX 3-9, 15-38). We disallow 10 percent of
these costs, resulting in allowable costs of $61,259, due to the inefficiencies of Eagle’s operation
which resulted in additional hauling of recyclables between Eagle’s Capitol Heights facility and the
CWI facility it was using at Olive Street.

       CWI Invoice Payments made by Eagle Management for 1994-1995

        During the 1994-1995 period when Eagle Management was subcontracting with haulers and
other vendors for the District recycling job, we find the following CWI invoice amounts, totaling
$205,479, to be supported by the record: invoice no. 6059 ($20,237.80), invoice no. 6024
($1,228.50), invoice no. 6453 ($16,963.90), invoice no. 6452 ($9,810), invoice no. 6574 ($6,240),
invoice no. 6454 ($1,456), invoice no. 6607 ($19,291.20), invoice no. 6575 ($1,074.50), invoice no.
6346 ($1,228.50), invoice no. 6344 ($8,100), invoice no. 6373 ($16,216.20), invoice no. 5906
($1,312.50), invoice no. 5904 ($13,020), invoice no. 5943 ($23,670.70), invoice no. 6023
($12,041.40), invoice no. 5763 ($33,849.80), invoice no. 5809 ($16,001.50), invoice no. 5806
($1,323), invoice no. 6690 ($2,280) (through 05-08-95), and invoice no. 6691 ($133) (through 05-
08-95). (HEX 39, 53). We disallow 10 percent of these costs, resulting in allowable costs of
$184,931, due to the inefficiencies of Eagle’s operation which resulted in additional hauling of
recyclables between Eagle’s Capitol Heights facility and the CWI facility it was using at Olive
Street.

       Summary of CWI subcontract costs

       Based on our review of the record, we find adequate support for costs paid to CWI under the
subcontracts category of costs in the total amount of $297,820, consisting of $51,630 under the May
1993 MOU, $61,259 charged to Eagle Maintenance’s subcontracts category for the period 1993-
1994, and $184,931 charged to Eagle Management’s subcontracts category for the period from
approximately September 1994 through the first week of May 1995.

       Rodgers Brothers

         Eagle claims costs for subcontracting with Rodgers Brothers of $80,775. In its June 28, 1996
letter to the OIG auditors, Eagle states that Rodgers Brothers was “[h]auling materials to market and
by-pass for disposal.” The invoices indicate that Rodgers Brothers was performing “dump and
return” services using 30-yard containers at the rate of $400 or $425 each. (E.g., HEX 57, 58). The
trucking slips do not indicate a destination location. We find that Rodgers Brothers was hauling all
or nearly all of the material to a landfill for disposal.

        The record (including Eagle vouchers and Rodgers Brothers invoices) supports the following
hauling costs totaling $67,200 which Eagle charged to the subcontracts cost account 3800-000-46:
invoice nos. 000837 ($3,000), 000838 ($8,075), 000853 ($12,325), 000891 ($11,900), 001201
($4,000), 001200 ($6,000), 001207 ($10,000), and 000908 ($11,900). Some or all of the charges on
invoice nos. 000943 and 000963 relate to unallowable amounts for fire damage removal arising from
the July 1993 fire at Eagle’s Capitol Heights facility. Because we are unable to discern whether
there are allowable amounts within those invoices, we find the invoice amounts are not adequately
                                                  - 33 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

supported in the record.

       Brent Trucking

         In its claim submission, Eagle claims costs of $95,100 charged to the subcontracts cost
account for Brent Trucking. In our review, we found that some of the amounts that Eagle placed in
the ODC category of its claim submission were not actually charged to the ODC cost account but
rather were charged to the subcontracts cost account. That explains why we find supported
subcontract costs which exceed the $95,100 amount in the claim submission. In its June 28, 1996
letter to the OIG auditors, Eagle states that Brent Trucking was “[h]auling . . . recyclable material to
market and by-pass for disposal.” The invoices indicate that Brent Trucking was performing “dump
and return” services using 30-yard containers at the rate of $300 each. The trucking slips do not
indicate a destination location. Most likely, Brent was hauling material to a landfill.

        Beyond the pre-adjusted $48,300 of transportation costs for Brent Trucking charged to the
ODC category of fuel, maintenance and transportation cost account 3800-000-43 discussed earlier,
the record (including Eagle vouchers and Brent Trucking invoices) supports the following additional
hauling costs, totaling $116,475,which Eagle charged to the subcontracts cost account 3800-000-46:
 11/18/93 invoice no. 5470 ($375), 1/10/94 invoice no. 5719 ($14,700), 1/25/94 invoice no. 5821
($15,600), 2/10/94 invoice no. 5936 ($1,500), 2/10/94 invoice no. 5937 ($31,500), 2/25/94 invoice
no. 6041 ($39,600), and 3/25/94 invoice no. 6228 ($13,200). The record does not adequately
support the 5/10/94 invoice no. 6499 ($2,400) (check voided) and the 4/25/94 invoice no. 6440
($13,800).

       Georgetown Express

        Eagle claims costs of $67,375 for subcontracting with Georgetown Express for hauling
services. In its June 28, 1996 letter to the OIG auditors, Eagle states that Georgetown Express was
“[h]auling materials to market and hauling by-pass for disposal.” Georgetown Express invoices do
not contain the truck tickets showing what material was being transported nor the pick-up location or
destination for the shipment. The invoices simply describe the services as “Open Top Haul” and the
unit charge is either $125 (through September 1993) or $375 (after September 1993). We find that
the record (including vouchers and invoices) support $51,625 in charges to subcontract cost account
3800-000-46.

       MGM Brokerage/Transport

        Eagle claims costs of $10,243 for subcontracting with MGM Brokerage/Transport, which
mainly consisted of transporting marketable glass to Owens Brockway Glass Recycling Center in
Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Generally, MGM charged $300 for each approximately 20 ton
tractor trailer haul, thus at a rate of about $15 per ton. One invoice indicates that MGM hauled a
load of newspaper to Capitol Fiber for that same rate. Invoices support the $10,243 charged under
subcontract cost account 3800-000-46.
                                                 - 34 -         Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

       Laidlaw

        Eagle claims costs for subcontracting with Laidlaw of $9,468. In its June 28, 1996 letter to
the OIG auditors, Eagle does not identify any hauling services by Laidlaw. A review of the invoices
show that Eagle had some type of arrangement whereby it would have materials delivered to
Laidlaw for processing by Laidlaw. For example, Laidlaw was provided “blue bag” recyclables
which it would process at $50 per ton and thereafter the material became Laidlaw’s, not Eagle’s, and
the District would receive no market revenue. (Tr. 231-232; HEX 60). Although Eagle’s Mr. Tynes
said that it was the District that dictated the use of Laidlaw for overflow of recyclables (Tr. 920),
documentation shows that it was Eagle that designated Laidlaw as a facility for receiving
recyclables. (Tynes letter to Francis, dated January 10, 1994). It is not clear which materials were
DPW-collected materials and which materials came from other Eagle jobs. Nor does the record
indicate the details of the arrangement between Eagle and Laidlaw. Finally, the recyclables became
Laidlaw’s and the District saw no benefit from marketing. For lack of adequate support, we find the
costs associated with Laidlaw to be unsupported and unallowable.

       Waste Management

        Eagle claims costs for subcontracting with Waste Management of $1,772. In its June 28,
1996 letter to the OIG auditors, Eagle states that Waste Management was “[h]auling . . . by-pass for
disposal.” The invoices indicate charges to a Department of State job, Sovran Tennis job, a
“Mosque Cleanup job”, and charges for truck rentals under various District recycling codes. We
find the $1,772 claims costs unsupported by the record.

       Summary of Supported Hauling Costs

       Based on our review of the record, we find supported hauling costs of $543,363.

       2.      Other Subcontract Costs

        Although hauling costs constituted the vast majority of subcontract costs claimed by Eagle,
there are other subcontract costs which we analyze below.

       Frank Johnson

        Frank Johnson was the Capitol Heights facility’s plant manager who was hired by Eagle as
an independent contractor. (June 28, 1996 letter to OIG Auditors). Eagle has claimed subcontract
costs totaling $42,050, consisting of $3,300 summarized on Schedules 2 and 2A for 1993, $22,400
summarized on Schedules 3 and 3A for 1994, and costs of $16,350 claimed through Eagle
Management for the period of late 1994 through April 1995. An invoice covering February 1995
indicates that Johnson was paid a lump sum of $150 per day for his consulting work at Eagle’s
Capitol Heights facility. (HEX 66Y). We find that the record adequately supports the claimed
amount of $42,050.

       Clarence Miller

       Mr. Furby stated that he believed that Clarence Mill was a small hauler who might have
hauled one item away from the Capitol Heights facility. (Tr. 241-242). Eagle has claimed
subcontract costs of $675, represented by a single charge for May 1993. (HEX 66R). An invoice
covering February 1995 indicates that Johnson was paid a lump sum of $150 per day for his
consulting work at Eagle’s Capitol Heights facility. (HEX 66Y). We find that the record adequately
supports the claimed amount of $675.

       Mid-Atlantic Waste

        Eagle claims $3,082 for costs it paid to Mid-Atlantic Waste for acquiring various hoppers
used in the recycling operation. We find that the record adequately supports the claimed amount of
$3,082.

       GB&B

         Eagle claims $20,000 for costs it paid to the consulting firm Gershman, Brickner & Bratton,
Inc. ("GB&B"). (HEX 66R). Although KPMG initially allowed the amount, Eagle has since agreed
with OIG auditors who disallowed these as subcontract costs because they relate to consulting work
on the proposed new Eagle recycling facility. As discussed below, we find that under the
circumstances presented here the costs incurred by Eagle for the proposed new Eagle recycling
facility are not recoverable under the actual cost standard of D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2).

       John Gray P.C.

        Eagle claims $4,500 charged in August 1993 for architectural services by John Gray relating
to the new District-based facility. (HEX 66R; Tr. 243-244, 522). Those costs are not allowable for
the same reasons discussed above with regard to GB&B.

       Hirrlinger Electric

        Eagle claims $2,075 charged on a January 10, 1994 invoice of Hirrlinger Electric for
electrical work at the Capitol Heights facility. (HEX 66S). We find the amount to be allowable.

       ABC Burglar Alarm

       Eagle claims $380 for various invoices charged to the subcontracts cost account between
January and June 1994 for burglar alarm services provided by ABC Burglar Alarm Systems. (HEX
66S). We find the amount to be allowable.

       Strickland Fire Protection

       Eagle claims $505 for one or more invoices charged to the subcontracts cost account in
January 1994. (HEX 66S). We have found one invoice in the amount of $305 charged to the
subcontracts cost account 3800-000-46 for mechanical services. We find that amount to be
                                               - 36 -         Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

allowable.

       Bradby Electrical

      Eagle claims $4,410 for work charged to the subcontracts cost account in January 1994.
(HEX 66S). We find the amount to be unsupported in the record.

       AMEX

       Eagle claims $1,000 charged to the subcontracts cost account in March 1994. (HEX 66S).
We find the amount to be unsupported in the record.

       Wamo Welding

       Eagle claims $3,377 charged to the subcontracts cost account between March and August
1994. (HEX 66S). We find the amount to be part of a $5,877 capital improvement to the Capital
Heights facility which benefited more than simply the District recycling job. Accordingly, the
amount claimed is unallowable.

       Robert McCall

       Eagle claims $9,468.20 charged to the subcontracts cost account between March and June
1994. (HEX 66S). The record does not disclose any vouchers and invoices charged to the
subcontracts cost account. We did find find an agreement for McCall to perform various
unallowable capital improvements for a price of $6,400. The amount claimed is unsupported and
unallowable.

       Meyers Consulting Engineers

        Eagle claims $2,037 charged to the subcontracts cost account in August 1994. (HEX 66S).
The record discloses that the amount was part of the capital improvements undertaken by Wamo
Welding. (HEX 62). Although Meyer Consulting Engineers was a subcontractor of Wamo
Welding, due to an apparent failure of Eagle to complete its payment to Wamo, it was arranged that
Eagle pay Meyer directly. Because the capital improvement benefited more than simply the District
recycling job, the claim amount is unallowable.

       Federal Pest Control

        Eagle claims $800 charged to the subcontracts cost account between January and August
1994, at $100 per month, for pest control services. (HEX 66S). We find adequate support in the
record for the amount claimed. Eagle also claims $400 for the period September through December
1994 and $600 for the period January through May 1995. The record discloses invoices for these
periods and we allow a total of $800 for the period September 1994 through April 1995. Thus, we
find $1,600 in supported costs.
                                                  - 37 -         Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377



       “Other”

       Eagle claims a net of $73,600.46 under the subcontracts cost account between June and
December 1993. (HEX 66R). Eagle has failed to provide adequate support in the record for these
costs. Accordingly, they are disallowed.

       Overhead Door

       Under Eagle Management’s subcontractors cost account for the period January through May
1995, Eagle claims an amount of $325.66 . From the documentation in the record, it appears that
this amount is part of a larger capital improvement that Eagle made to its facility which benefited
Eagle beyond the District recycling job. Accordingly, we disallow the amount.

       “Temporary Call-In”

        Under Eagle Management’s subcontractors cost account for the period September through
December 1994, Eagle claims various amounts totaling $2,453.38 labeled as “Temporary Call-In L.”
Under the same cost account for the period January through May 1995, Eagle claims various
amounts totaling $5,136 labeled as “Temporary Call-In L.” Although these amounts were not
explained by Eagle, it appears that these amounts represent temporary labor. Eagle agreed with the
OIG auditors that the temporary labor was not allowable. (Tr. 162). If some copies of checks paid
to the order of Adolphus McLean are meant to be the support, we do not find them to be adequate.

       Summary of Allowable and Allocable Subcontracts Costs

        In addition to supported hauling costs of $543,363, we find supported costs of $50,167 for
the other costs charged to the subcontracts cost accounts of Eagle (including Eagle Management).
As with the charging of ODCs, we saw instances where Eagle improperly allocated costs arising
from other Eagle jobs to the District recycling job. For example, CWI performed hauling services
for Eagle’s other jobs, but in at least some cases, Eagle did not allocate such costs to the other jobs
but rather charged them under the District recycling cost accounts. (E.g., HEX 21 (ticket relating to
NASA job); HEX 46, 50 (NASA Goddard Space Center)). Because of Eagle’s record keeping, we
are unable to determine the extent of such erroneous charges. When it came to responsibility for
approving the allocation of costs to Eagle jobs, we find that Mr. Furby in his testimony was not
always forthcoming. (See, e.g., Tr. 188-192). Nevertheless, as with the labor and ODC categories
of costs, we find that the 5 percent deduction for Eagle’s other recycling jobs performed at the
Capitol Heights facility should be applied to subcontract costs because at least 5 percent of the
material handled at the Capitol Heights facility was generated from other Eagle recycling and
janitorial jobs. Therefore, after applying the 5 percent deduction to the unadjusted total subcontract
costs of $593,530, we find allocable and allowable subcontract costs for Eagle of $563,854.

       E.      Eagle's General and Administrative Cost

       G&A costs are indirect costs that are not attributable to any single cost objective but which
are pooled and then allocated among all company cost objectives. We asked the parties to address
                                                  - 38 -         Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

whether G&A costs should be allowable under the actual cost standard of D.C. Code § 1-
1182.5(d)(2). We agree with the OIG that some G&A costs, such as administrative and clerical
salaries, which can be shown to have reasonably benefited the performance of the work under the
invalid contract, may be recognized, even though due to the nature of the costs it is proper to collect
them in indirect cost pools and then allocate them among projects rather then attempt to allocate
portions and charge them as direct costs of the various projects. (Tr. 817).

        Eagle claims G&A costs of $570,063 using G&A pools for 1993 ($1,302,292), 1994
($1,615,232), and 1995 ($403,608), and claimed total cost base for 1993 ($8,731,322), 1994
($10,654,668), and 1995 ($2,562,546), for Eagle’s calculated G&A rates of 14.92 percent for 1993,
15.16 percent for 1994, and 15.75 percent for 1995. (HEX 65B, Appendix 1, Eagle Schedule 7).
Eagle then applied these rates to claimed direct costs and fringe benefits for 1993 ($1,503,731), 1994
($1,680,519), and 1995 ($577,393) (HEX 65B, Appendix 1, Eagle Schedules 2-4), to arrive at its
total G&A costs of $570,063.

        In its initial audit, the OIG auditors questioned $48,262 of Eagle’s claimed G&A costs due to
an overstatement of Eagle’s G&A rate arising from unallowable costs (interest, entertainment, and
contributions) included in the G&A cost pool that Eagle used in calculating the rate, and from
reduced direct cost bases for 1993 and 1994. (HEX 65B, at 12 (Finding No. 5)). In the initial audit,
however, the OIG auditors had not examined whether individual items of the claimed costs in the
G&A cost pools were adequately supported. During its supplemental auditing procedures, the OIG
auditors discovered that of a sample of $208,302 of listed G&A costs, $108,981 of those costs were
unsupported. (HEX 69A; Tr. 820). The OIG auditors also found additional unallowable costs.
(HEX 69A; Tr. 820-821). Based on this supplemental audit, the OIG auditors calculated new G&A
rates for each of the three years. In addition to finding significant unallowable and unsupported
costs, the OIG auditors also determined that it was improper for Eagle to charge Eagle
Maintenance’s G&A rate on Eagle Management “subcontract” costs which included Eagle
Management G&A. (HEX 69A; Tr. 821-826). The OIG auditors also felt that it was unreasonable
for Eagle to charge the G&A rate on its substantial subcontract costs. According to the OIG
auditors, a rate of 3-5 percent is more typical in the industry for subcontract costs, although the
auditors declined to make an analysis to calculate such a rate for Eagle. (Tr. 822-827).
Nevertheless, the OIG auditors used their re-calculated G&A rates for 1993, 1994, and 1995, and
applied those rates to the entire cost base, including subcontract costs. To determine the questioned
G&A amounts, the OIG auditors multiplied the G&A rates by the amount of OIG’s questioned base
costs of the District recycling job and then also deducted the Eagle Maintenance G&A on Eagle
Management costs to arrive at a total G&A disallowance of $240,798. (HEX 65A, at 9-10; HEX
69A; Tr. 826-827).

       We find that Eagle’s G&A cost pool is not adequately supported in the record. Of the
approximate $200,000 of G&A costs randomly tested by the OIG auditor, one half of the costs were
unsupported. In addition, the OIG auditor determined that another $78,000 of claimed G&A costs
were unallowable. We also find that the OIG rates and Eagle rates are unreasonably high for
applying to subcontract costs on this particular recycling job.

      We could deny all Eagle G&A costs for lack of adequate support, but such a blanket denial
may be unfair since clearly there are some allowable G&A costs. We adopt another approach.
                                                   - 39 -          Recycling Solutions, Inc., CAB No. P-377

Eagle proposed in its BAFO a G&A rate of 11 percent on total costs. (PCX 21). We find this rate to
be reasonable even considering the problems with Eagle’s G&A cost support. Applying a G&A rate
of 11 percent to Eagle’s allowable and allocable costs for labor ($983,622), labor burden ($229,934),
ODCs ($353,635), and subcontract costs ($563,854), a total of $2,131,045, we find Eagle entitled to
G&A costs of $234,415.

        F.      Eagle's District-based Processing Facility Costs

       Eagle claims construction related costs of $5,548,367 for its new District-based intermediate
processing facility, consisting of property costs ($1,371,781), site preparation and construction
($2,056,160), processing equipment ($1,813,840), consulting fees ($120,000), architect fees
($125,000), attorney fees and other fees ($39,046), permits ($12,666), and environmental and other
surveys ($9,874). (HEX 65B, Appendix 1, Eagle Schedule 13). Eagle argues that these costs are
allowable costs because they were costs incurred in and for the performance of the invalid contract
and that “construction and completion of the facility were essential to Eagle’s ability to perform
under the contract . . . .” (Eagle Brief, at 9).

        The statement of work permitted Eagle to have its interim processing facility (i.e., the Capitol
Heights, Maryland facility) within a 10 mile radius of the District’s border but further provided that
“beginning on the first day of the second year of the contract, the contractor must have a fully
operational processing facility within the District from which all activities, except buy back
operations, associated with performance of this contract shall be conducted.” (PCX 12, at 3 (Article
1)). The bilateral modification of the purported contract, entered into by the District and Eagle on
the same date as the contract, provides, inter alia, that “[t]he contractor is responsible for obtaining
all permits necessary to establish the recycling processing and buy back facilities in the District. . . .
The processing and buy back facilities are private facilities which are the sole responsibility of the
contractor.” (PCX 12, at 1).

        The OIG disallowed all of the claimed facility costs principally on the basis that the bilateral
modification made clear that the facility was Eagle’s private facility and its sole responsibility.
(HEX 65A, at 10). The OIG also pointed out that Eagle was using the facility after the end of the
District recycling job for commercial purposes and that the facility had a commercial value. Also,
Eagle used the facility for a follow-on recycling contract awarded by the District to Eagle.
Moreover, although Eagle was to have the facility available for processing at the beginning of the
second year of the District recycling job, Eagle did not have the facility completed until after the
District recycling job was ended. Thus, during the performance period, Eagle never used the new
District-based facility. (Tr. 17-21, 57).

        We agree with the OIG’s analysis. Eagle had no legitimate expectation of recovering costs
of the District-based facility pursuant to the purported contract and bilateral modification, those
costs never benefited the District recycling job, and the costs represent capital improvements that
have a commercial value to Eagle. Accordingly, Eagle’s claimed costs for construction of the
District-based intermediate processing facility are not recoverable under D.C. Code § 1-
1182.5(d)(2).

V.     Eagle Revenue from Marketing Recyclables

        Determining Eagle’s revenue from marketing the recyclable materials is necessary because to
arrive at the proper actual costs incurred by Eagle under D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2), such market
revenue must be deducted from total actual costs determined in part IV, supra, in order to obtain net
actual costs. (Tr. 815-816).

        Eagle claimed that it had received revenue totaling $178,558.31 from the marketing of its
District recyclables, consisting of $51,417.50 in 1993, $72,166.61 in 1994, and $54,974.20 in 1995.
The OIG auditors found that Eagle's ledgers showed additional amounts of $14,496 in marketing
revenue for 1993 and 1994 which Eagle did not report. (HEX 65B, at 13-14). Eagle replied to the
OIG auditors by stating that some of the 1993 and 1994 revenue was not attributable to the District
recycling job. However, Eagle failed to produce any documentation to support allocating those
revenues to Eagle’s other recycling activities. Indeed, Eagle was unable to locate its files of the
vendors to whom it marketed its recyclables. (Tr. 104-105). We find that the OIG properly
determined that the unreported amounts were revenue on the District recycling job. Thus, OIG
determined that Eagle had received market revenue of $193,054. RSI states that it independently
obtained and examined cancelled checks and invoices from Eagle’s marketing vendors and
determined that Eagle underreported market revenue totaling another $92,249.84. RSI suggests that
some of the checks from the vendors were never recorded on Eagle’s general ledger. (Eagle Reply,
filed Aug. 7, 1997, Ex. A). Although RSI lists check numbers, dates, and amounts, RSI did not
submit the cancelled checks and invoices into the record. The OIG did not make an independent
investigation of market revenue by contacting market vendors. On the record presented, we are
unable to find that Eagle received market revenue beyond the $193,054 determined by the OIG.
Because we have found for cost purposes that 5 percent of Eagle’s recycling activities were allocable
to non-District recycling, we recognize a similar 5 percent credit in the amount of $9,653 for
revenue from the sale of non-District recyclables, for a net marketing revenue of $183,401.

VI.    Eagle’s Net Actual Costs Incurred Under D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2)

        In Part IV, we determined that for the District recycling job Eagle has established actual
costs incurred of $2,365,460. In Part V, we determined that Eagle earned net market revenue of
$183,401. Thus, Eagle’s net actual costs incurred on the District recycling job equals $2,182,059.

VII.   District Payments to Eagle for the District Recycling Job

        The record is clear that the District paid Eagle a total of $3,142,022 relating to the District
recycling job. During the approximate 2-year performance period, Eagle submitted invoices to the
District totaling $3,095,325, DPW approved $2,876,706 of the amount billed, and Eagle received
payments from DPW totaling $2,070,056. (HEX 65B, at 6, OIG Schedule K). Purporting to settle
disputed amounts while Eagle’s claim was pending before the Board, DPW paid Eagle an additional
amount of $1,071,966 in January 1996, bringing total payments to $3,142,022.

                                         CONCLUSION

        Pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1182.5(d)(2), Eagle is entitled to net actual costs incurred on the
District recycling job of $2,182,059. The District has made total payment to Eagle of $3,142,022.
Accordingly, the District has overpaid Eagle by $959,963 and is liable to the District for the amount
of overpayment.
