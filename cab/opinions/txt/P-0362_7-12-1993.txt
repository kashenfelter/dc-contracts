                                                OPINION

      Commercial Recovery, Inc. (Commercial, Protestor), has challenged award of the
above-captioned solicitation and requests that the contract be terminated for the
convenience of the District of Columbia Government and that a new solicitation be issued.
The solicitation was for a Discrimination Study on Minority Business Enterprises.

        The protest consists of nineteen (19) numbered paragraphs. Some of the paragraphs
are informational, and some set forth the grounds of the protest. In sum, the Protestor
alleges: (a) the protest is timely filed; (b) the awardee is not responsive or responsible
because it does not employ a licensed attorney; (c) the awardee is not responsive or
responsible because it is a foreign corporation; (d) the awardee's initial proposal was not
responsive in that ". . . the cost price portion was too low to even come within the
competitive range established by the Government and as a result, displayed a lack of
understanding as to the specifics of the solicitation."; (e) the awardee was accorded
preferential treatment and given unfair advantage as a result of being extended multiple
opportunities to submit best and final offers (BAFO) to move into the competitive cost
proposal range while the protestor was not accorded such treatment; (f) the awardee was
accorded preferential treatment and given unfair advantage as a result of being given notice
of a substitution of an entirely new "scope of work", deliverables, proposal content and
evaluation proposal requirements, while the protestor was not given this notice and the
opportunity to submit a new or revised proposal; (g) the substitution of an entirely new
"scope of work", deliverables, proposal content and evaluation proposal requirements was
such a material change in the solicitation that a new solicitation should have been made and
notice given to all offerors; (h) the price proposal and technical proposal submitted by the


     ljAt the time this matter came before the Board, three judges were assigned to the panel. This decision
is rendered by a majority vote of the three judges assigned. Rule 101.5, 36 DCR 2686 (April 21, 1989). See

                                                    -2-           CAB No. P-362, Commercial Recovery, Inc.

Protestor on January 2, 1992, was permitted to be placed in an unsecured location in an
open safe for several months; (i) the District government's withholding of requested
information as to the qualifications of the awardee was totally arbitrary, capricious and done
in a bad faith attempt to frustrate disclosure of the basis for protest and contesting an
award; and U) the awardee in this instance is not qualified to perform the services solicited
and the inclusion of "... majority subcontractors who will perform the tecimical services
solicited, is nothing more than a ruse to place the responsibility for the work to be
performed in the hands of majority contractors who do not have to quality [sic]
independently or be subjected to public scrutiny."

        The District of Columbia has timely moved to dismiss the protest in part, and has
filed an agency report with regard to the remainder of the protest. In its motion to dismiss
the District argues that counts (paragraphs) 7, 9, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 19 of the protest should
be dismissed because they do not set forth a clear and concise statement of the le~al and
factual grounds of the protest pursuant to Board Rule 302.1(c), 36 DCR 2711.- The


   YThe referenced paragraphS, or counts, of the protest assert as follows:

               7.       That the awardee appears to be a foreign corporation organized under the
       Laws of the State of Delaware with one share-holder who also serves as the sole Director, the
       sole President, the sole Secretary and the sole Treasurer.

               9.       That at issue here is the integrity of a program designed to facilitate minority
       business participation in District of Columbia Government Procurement involving several
       hundred million dollars in procurement.

               14.       That the contract should not have been awarded to a contractor who is
       located out of state and has no nexus with the District of Columbia especially where sensitive
       and confidential District of Columbia proprietary data and information is moved outside of
       the District of Columbia and housed at such locations out side [sic] of the District of
       Columbia. From the materials disclosed, it appears that these sensitive and confidential data
       could be housed at locations in Maryland, Texas and Ohio.

                15.    That fees paid to this out of state awardee are not currently taxable by the
       District of Columbia and is contrary to the policy of the District of Columbia Government
       and Mayoral Orders favoring District of Columbia minority and disadvantaged companies.
       (sic).

               16.     That the price proposal and technical proposal submitted by the protestor
       on January 2, 1992, was permitted to be plated in an unsecured location in an open safe for
       several months.

               18.      That the District Government's withholding of requested information as to
       the qualifications of the awardee was totally arbitrary, capricious and done in a bad faith
       attempt to frustrate disclosure of the basis for protest and contesting any award.

                19.       That the awardee in this instance is not qualified to perform the services
       solicited and the inclusion of "majority subcontractors" who will perform the technical services
       solicited, is nothing more than a ruse to place the responsibility for the work to be performed
                                                                                                  (continued...)

District cites as support CUP Temporaries, Inc., CAB No. P-271, 39 DCR 4251 (1991);
Track-Tech International, CAB No. P-231, 38 DCR 3137 (1990).

        In its agency report the District notes that Commercial contends that the District
should have afforded it an opportunity to submit a proposal on the amended RFP. The
District responds that the evaluation panel and the contracting officer found the proposal
of Commercial not to be within the competitive range and, therefore, not eligible to receive
amendments or participate further in the procurement. The District points out that section
1615.2(c) of the procurement regulations requires the contracting officer to send
amendments only to those offerors found to be within the competitive range. Further, the
District argues that section 1615.3 of the procurement regulations requires the contracting
officer to issue a new solicitation if the change to the solicitation "... is so substantial that
it warrants complete revision of a solicitation." That is not the case here, the District asserts,
because the changes to the specifications either included updated statistical information or
reduced the amount of time to perform the contract.

       The District also argues that the multiple requests for BAFO's were done pursuant
to 27 DCMR ยง 1622.3 and were requested of all offerors in the competitive range. Finally,
the District argues that the contracting officer properly determined in writing, pursuant to
27 DCMR ยง 2200.2, that the prospective contractor was responsible and met the
requirements for responsibility set forth in the regulations.

        On March 22, 1992, the Protestor filed its "Opposition to Government's Motion for
Summary Judgrnent."ยฅ The Board assumes that this pleading is intended to address the
motion to dismiss and agency report of the District. In its opposition, the Protestor
summarily asserts that its protest sets forth a clear and concise statement and cites as
support, Track-Tech International, CAB No. P-231, 38 DCR 3137 (1990). Protestor argues
also that the Board must look to the "cardinal changes" doctrine developed by the Court of
Federal Claims to evaluate this protest where the modified work is materially different from
the work for which the parties contracted. Air-A-Plan Corp. v. United States, 408 F.2d 1030
(Ct. Cl. 1969); American Air Filter Co., Inc., 57 Compo Gen. 285 (1978). Protestor continues
that when an agency's needs change so that a material discrepancy is created between the
RFP's ground rules and the agency's actual needs, the RFP should be amended and all
eligible offerors be given an opportunity to revise their proposals accordingly. Union
Carbide Corp., 55 Comp. Gen. 802 (1976), 76-1 CPD ! 134.

       Protestor further argues that the awardee had submitted a mathematically unbalanced
bid and therefore it should have been rejected. Landscape Builders Contractors, B-225808.3
(1987) 87-1 CPD ! 533. Finally, Protestor argues that the District's action in assisting the

         SUbjected to public scrutiny.

   ,vProtestor was granted an enlargement of time within which to file this pleading by Board Order dated
March 15, 1993.

awardee to bring its cost price proposal into the competitive range constituted technical
leveling. Raytheon Ocean Sup. Co., B-218620.2 (1986) 86-1 CPD , 134.

        On May 12, 1993, the District filed a response to Protestor's opposition. The District
correctly points out that Protestor failed to adequately address the District's challenge that
seven grounds of the protest fail to set forth clear and concise statements as required by the
Board's rules. Further, the District correctly points out that while Protestor cites case law
concerning cardinal changes and technical leveling, Protestor fails to show any evidence of
either.

        As shown in the fifteen (15) exhibits appended to the agency report, the following
facts are relevant to this protest:

              1.     By Determination & Findings (D&F) dated November 13, 1991,
       the Director of the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) authorized
       the use of competitive sealed proposals for solicitation of a Discrimination
       Study On Minority Business Enterprises. (Exhibit 1 to Agency Report). On
       November 17, 1992, notice of the issuance of RFP 1313-AA-NS-7-LH for
       Discrimination Study On Minority Business Enterprises (RFP) appeared in the
       Washington Post. (Id.) DAS issued the RFP on November 19, 1991, with a
       closing date of December 20, 1991. (Exhibit 2 to Agency Report). The RFP
       provided for a contract term of one year with an option to extend the term for
       an additional one-year period. On December 12, 1991, DAS issued
       Addendum No.1; and on December 23, 1991, DAS issued Addendum No.2
       to the RFP. (Id.) Addendum No.1 extended the proposal submission date
       from December 20, 1991 to January 2, 1992. Addendum No.2 changed the
       price evaluation section of the RFP and extended the proposal submission
       date to January 16, 1992.

               2.     On January 16, 1992, prior to 4:30 p.m., DAS received five
       acceptable offers regarding the RFP. (Exhibit 3 to Agency Report). By
       memorandum dated February 25, 1992, the evaluation panel sent to DAS the
       technical scores. (Exhibit 5 to Agency Report). By memorandum dated
       March 27, 199[2], the evaluation panel submitted to DAS the combined
       technical and price scores and suggested to DAS areas which required
       clarification during negotiations. (Exhibit 6 to Agency Report). The
       combined technical and price scores were as follows:

               1.   A. D. Jackson Consultants, Inc. (Jackson)           79.5
               2.   Roberts - Roberts & Assoc. (Roberts)                73.6
               3.   Coopers & Lybrand (Coopers)                         64.8

              The evaluation panel found Jackson, Roberts, and Coopers to
be within the competitive range and recommended that DAS began
negotiations with the three offerors. (Id.)

        3.     By letter dated April 20, 1992, DAS wrote to Jackson, Roberts,
and Coopers setting forth areas for clarification and requesting additional
information regarding each proposal. (Exhibit 7 to Agency Report). By
letters dated April 27, 1992, from Jackson and Roberts, and letter dated April
28, 1992, from Coopers, the three offerors responded to DAS. (Exhibit 8 to
Agency Report).

       4.     On June 12, 1992, DAS issued Addendum No. 3 and requested
best and final offers (BAPO's) by June 18, 1992. (Exhibit 9 to Agency
Report). Addendum No.3 eliminated the option year and required that the
contractor complete the discrimination study within 12 months of award.
Addendum No.3 also conformed deliverables to the 12-month performance
period and made minor changes to the scope of work. (Id.)

       5.     On June 17, 1992, DAS issued Addendum No.4, which set forth
the estimated number of contracts over $10,000.00. (ld.)

       6.     By letter dated June 17, 1992, Jackson submitted its first BAPO.
(Exhibit 10 to Agency Report).

       7.     By memorandum dated July 1, 1992, the evaluation panel sent
to DAS the evaluation of the first round of BAPO's submitted by June 18,
1992. The evaluation panel scored the first round of BAPO's as follows: (1)
Jackson - 86.169; (2) Roberts - 68.73; (3) Coopers - 67.85. (Exhibit 11 to
Agency Report). In the memorandum dated July 1, 1992, the evaluation
panel set forth uncertainties regarding the BAPO's and requested DAS to
conduct another round of BAPO's which would clarify the uncertainties. (ld.)

       8.      By letter dated July 3, 1992, and Addendum No.5, DAS advised
each of the offerors of the various uncertainties in the BAPO's which were
submitted to DAS on June 17, 1992. (Exhibit 12 to Agency Report). DAS
requested a second round of BAPO's which were to be submitted to DAS by
July 10, 1992. Addendum No.5 made minor additions and corrections to the
RFP. (Id.)

      9.   By letter dated July 9, 1992, Jackson submitted to DAS its
second BAPO dated July 9, 1992, and acknowledged Addendum No.5. (Id.)

       10.    By memorandums dated July 21, 1992, and July 27, 1992, the
evaluation panel submitted to DAS the evaluation of the second round of
BAPO's of the three offerors. (Exhibit 13 to Agency Report). The final
evaluation scores were as follows:
                                                                                        [5248]

                             Jackson                76.56
                             Roberts                72.06
                             Coopers                59.26



                      By memorandum dated July 31,1992, from the evaluation panel
       to DAS, the evaluation panel recommended that DAS award the contract to
       lithe highest responsible and responsive offeror." That offeror was Jackson.
       (Id.)

             11.    By D&F dated August 7, 1992, the contracting officer
       determined Jackson to be responsible. (Exhibit 14 to Agency Report).

             12.   By contract dated August 7, 1992, DAS made the award to
       Jackson. (Exhibit 15 to Agency Report).

       Turning first to the District's motion to dismiss, it will be granted in part and denied
in part. The Board notes that the grounds of the protest are disjointed and poorly pled.
However, it appears that paragraphs 7 and 14 of the protest (see footnote 2 for their text)
attempt to assert that the awardee is not responsive or responsible because it is not a
District of Columbia corporation. Our review of the RFP reveals that it does not require
that the successful offeror be a District of Columbia corporation. (Exhibit 2 to Agency
Report). In that regard, the District's procurement regulations provide that proposals be
evaluated based on the evaluation criteria of the solicitation. 27 DCMR ยง 1618.1. Inasmuch
as the awardee cannot properly be found nonresponsive or nonresponsible based on a non-
existent evaluation criterion, Protestor's challenge is without merit.

        The RFP does require that proposals be evaluated based on, and awarded points of
0-10, for furthering the goal of contracting with District of Columbia Government Minority
Business Opportunity Commission certified minority firms. The RFP at Section E:
Evaluation of Proposals, Evaluation Criteria, 3, provides in relevant part:

       Each proposal will be evaluated to the extent that it furthers the District of
       Columbia Government's goals and policies of promoting minority business
       opportunities and contracting and subcontracting with District of Columbia
       Government Minority Business Opportunity Commission certified minority
       firms. Points in this category can be earned only by offerors firmly
       demonstrating specific commitments to the participation of District certified
       minority firms in the proposed contract. The District is strongly encouraging
       a minority business participation level of at least thirty-five percent of the total
       contract price and will award points in this category in accordance with the
       scale shown below.
                                                                                     [5249]

                                                  (Exhibit 2 to Agency Report, p. 41).

With regard to the above-quoted evaluation criterion, the evaluation panel awarded the
successful offeror, Jackson, ten out of the ten points possible. (Exhibit 5 to Agency Report).
The Board's review of Jackson's proposal reveals that while it is a Delaware Corporation,
it is also, as the prime contractor, a minority-owned enterprise certified by the District of
Columbia Department of Human Rights and Minority Business Development; and a copy
of its certification was included in its proposal. (Exhibit 4 to Agency Report). In addition,
one of its two subcontractors is also a District-certified minority owned business enterprise,
and its certification was also submitted. (Id.) Therefore, because Jackson was properly
evaluated based on the evaluation criterion in the RFP, the Protestor's challenge, that it was
not responsive or responsible because it is a Delaware Corporation, must fail. Thus, this
ground of the protest is DENIED.

        Paragraph nine of the protest (see footnote 2 for text) does not set forth a proper
ground for protest and therefore, it is DISMISSED, with prejudice. Paragraph 15 of the
protest (see footnote 2 for text) raises a policy issue not within the purview of this Board
and therefore, it is DISMISSED, with prejudice. Paragraph 16 of the protest (see footnote
2 for text) does not set forth a proper ground for protest and therefore, it is DISMISSED,
with prejudice. Protestor has submitted no evidence or even argument to support paragraph
18 of the protest (see footnote 2 for text) and, therefore, it is DISMISSED, with prejudice.
See CUP Temporaries. Inc., supra. Paragraph nineteen (see footnote 2 for text) raises the
issue of evaluation of Jackson's minority business enterprise certification, which was
addressed above; and therefore, that ground is also DENIED.

       The Board considers now the remaining grounds of the protest.

      In paragraphs six and eight of the protest, Commercial appears to assert that the
awardee is not responsive or responsible because it does not employ a lawyer licensed to

practice in the DistrictY To assess this challenge, the Board must first consider the
relevant evaluation criteria for the instant solicitation. The RFP at Section E: Evaluation
of Proposals, Evaluation Criteria provides in relevant part:

       The following is the evaluation criteria that will be used to evaluate the
       proposals submitted:

       1.      Knowledge and Experience (0 - 60 points)

               a.       Expertise and relevant experience of assigned personnel
                        concerning disparity studies or similar types of studies or
                        research; the quality of a sample disparity study or research
                        product; relevant experience of each subcontractor assigned to
                        the project. (0 - 10 points)

               b.       The quality and comprehensiveness of the work plan for the
                        completion of the scope of work, including the availability of
                        key personnel and the assignment of related tasks and labor
                        hours. (0 - 10 points)

               c.       Clarity of the statement of understanding of City of Richmond
                        v. 1. A. Croson Co. and other relevant cases and their impact on
                        goal-oriented MBE programs. (0 - 10 points)

               d.       Knowledge of an experience with minority preference programs
                        (MBE/WBE/DBE) in procurement/contracting and the manner
                        in which they are implemented in various government agencies
                        and non-government organizations. (0 - 10 points)



   !lThe referenced paragraphS state:

       6.       That the very nature of this analysis and study mandates legal expertise and
       professional qualifications and license not possessed by the awardee in this case. More
       specifically, Sections III and IV of the RFP require disclosure of information about the
       offeror's organization, including resume's [sic) of personnel to be assigned, โข โขโข etc.
       Documentation of the offeror's experience is required along with the vitae of all staff
       members.

       8.       Neither the contracting entity nor its sole owner and officer is a lawyer or law firm
       licensed to practice law in the District of Columbia. In light of the fact that this particular
       procurement requires work and a work product which clearly constitutes the practice of law
       in the District of Columbia, it is imperative that full disclosure be made as to the experience
       and qualifications of the contracting entity and its sole officer to perform this service.
       Further, it does not appear that any of the sub-contractor "consultants" are licensed to
       practice law in the District of Columbia. In addition, this end product will have to withstand
       legal and perhaps even Constitutional scrutiny before the Federal Courts of the United
       States.
                                                                                               [5251]


                                                   -9-          CAB No. P-362, Commercial Recovery, Inc.

               e.       Computer/systems capability and abifity to develop, and
                        personnel with experience in developing statistical data and
                        other related programs to aid in the analysis and completion of
                        the study. (0 - 10 points)

               f.       Ability to meet the District's deadline. (0 - 10 points)

                                                         (Exhibit 2 to Agency Report, p. 40).

Clearly the evaluation criteria do not require the awardee to be an attorney licensed in the
District of Columbia. Instead, the awardee must have, inter alia, expertise in disparity
studies and an "understanding" of City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., and other relevant
cases. In the initial, January 25, 1992 evaluation, Jackson was awarded 3.4 out of 4 points
possible for its expertise in disparity studies. Jackson was awarded 10 out of 10 points
possible for its understanding of Richmond v. Croson. (Exhibit 5 to Agency Report). The
Board's review of Jackson's proposal reveals that the awardee submitted four pages of
related project experience in nine disparity studies. (Exhibit 4 to Agency Report, pp. 53-56).
With regard to understanding Richmond v. Croson, Jackson submitted 12 pages discussing
the Supreme Court decision, decisions after the Croson decision, and the development of
different constitutional standards to evaluate state and federal programs for disadvantaged
business entities. (ld., pp. 2-13). It appearing that Jackson's proposal was properly
evaluated pursuant to 27 DCMR ยง 1618.1, the Protestor's challenge must fail. The Board
has consistently held that in order to prevail, a protestor must prove by a preponderance of
the evidence that the District has committed a material violation of an applicable law,
regulation or term or condition of a solicitation. Silver Spring Ambulance Service, Inc., CAB
No. P-218, 5 P.D. 4046, 4052-4053 (January 15, 1993); CTA Management Group, Inc., CAB
No. P-71, 38 DCR 2935, 2937-2938 (1991). Protestor has failed to show that the awardee
was not properly evaluated; and therefore, this ground of the protest is DENIED.

        Next we consider Protestor's challenges to the awardee's cost proposal. Protestor
asserts that Jackson's initial cost proposal was not responsive because it was too low to come
within the competitive range established by the government. However, the evidence does
not support this challenge. The government's estimated fair and reasonable cost for the
contract was $260,000.00. (Exhibit 1 to Agency Report). Jackson's initial cost proposal was
for $262,388.00. (Exhibits 4 and 6 to Agency Report). The evaluation criteria for cost of
the study was 0 - 20 points. (Exhibit 2 to Agency Report). Jackson was awarded a score
of 12.6 points out of a possible 20 points for its cost proposal. (Exhibit 6 to Agency Report).
The District determined that a score of 60 and above (combined technical and cost
proposal) to be within the competitive range. (Id.) Jackson's initial combined score was
79.5 and within the competitive range. (ld.; F.F. 2)Y Therefore, Protestor's challenge that
Jackson's cost proposal was not responsive or in the competitive range must fail, and is
DENIED.

       Next the Protestor asserts that Jackson was given preferential treatment in being
allowed to submit multiple BAPO's, while the Protestor was not. The District is correct that
multiple rounds of BAPO's are permitted by 27 DCMR ยง 1622.3. The District is also
correct that BAPO's need only be requested of offerors in the competitive range pursuant
to 27 DCMR ยง 1622.5. Because the Protestor was found not to be within the competitive
range, it was not entitled to submit a BAPO. SOC Integrated Services, Inc., B-195624, 80-1
CPO! 44, (1980); United Computing Systems, Inc., B-204045, 81-2 CPO ~ 247, (1981); see
American Communications Company, B-247106, 92-1 CPO 4J[ 415; Dynamic Isolation
Systems, Inc., B-247047, 92-1 CPO ~ 399; Facilities Management, Inc., B-247698, 92-1 CPO
! 394. Therefore, this ground of the protest is DENIED.

        The next challenge raised by Protestor with regard to Jackson's cost proposal is that
the government, "... determined that the awardee's bid was unbalanced and as a result, the
bidder should have been rejected." (Opposition to Government's Motion for Summary
Judgment, p. 4). The Board does not agree. First of all, the government did not
"determine" that Jackson's cost proposal was unbalanced. In response to Jackson's first
BAPO, submitted on June 17, 1992 (F.F. 6), the government, by letter dated July 3, 1992,
advised Jackson (as well as the other two offerors) of the uncertainties raised by its BAPO
(F.F. 8). The government advised Jackson, inter alia, that: (1) the government estimate
exceeded its BAPO cost proposal; and (2) the total cost ($244,230.00) quoted on the Cost
and Price Analysis form was in conflict with the total cost ($233,548.00) quoted on the
Hourly Staff Chart. (Exhibit 12 to Agency Report). Therefore, the government directed
that Jackson "[pJrovide an explanation as to how you plan to provide the services at the
stated or amended price and the resolution of any conflicting price data." (Id.) Thus, the
July 3, 1992, letter from the government does not set forth a determination that Jackson's
cost proposal in its initial BAPO was unbalanced. Further, the Board's review of Jackson's
initial BAPO, the government's letter of July 3, 1992, and Jackson's second BAPO of July
9, 1992, does not reveal that Jackson's cost proposal was mathematically unbalanced. In our
review, we rely on the standards used by the Comptroller General in determining whether
a bid should be rejected as unbalanced. A concise statement of that standard is set forth
in Oregon Iron Works, Inc., B-247845, 92-1 CPO 4J[ 474 (May 27, 1992):

       Before a bid can be rejected as unbalanced, it must be found both
       mathematically and materially unbalanced.         A bid is mathematically
       unbalanced where it is based on nominal prices for some of the items and
       enhanced prices for other items. OMSERV Corp., 8-237691, March 13, 1990,
       90-1 CPO! 271. A bid may not be found mathematically unbalanced absent
       evidence that it contains prices which are overstated. IMPSA Int'l, Inc., B-
       221903, June 2, 1986, 86-1 CPO! 506. A mathematically unbalanced bid is
       considered materially unbalanced and cannot be accepted where there is a
       reasonable doubt that acceptance of the bid will result in the lowest overall
       cost to the government. Star Brite Constr. Co., B-244122, Aug. 20, 1991,91-2
       CPO! 173.

Here, Protestor has failed to show, and there is no evidence in the record, that Jackson's
cost proposal contained both overstated prices for some items and understated prices for
                                                                                       [5253]


                                             - 11 -      CAB No. P-362, Commercial Recovery, Inc.

others. Thus, there is no basis to find that Jackson's cost proposal was mathematically
unbalanced and therefore, this ground of the protest is DENIED.

       The final challenge to awardee's cost proposal is that the government engaged in
technical leveling in assisting the awardee to bring its cost proposal into the competitive
range. Protestor cites as support Raytheon Ocean Sys. Co., supra. However, by definition,
technical leveling relates to the technical aspects of a proposal and not to the cost proposal.
We refer Protestor to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) at subparts 15.61O(d) and
(e) for the distinction between technical leveling and transfusion (concerning technical
proposals) and auction techniques (concerning cost proposals). While the District's
procurement regulations do not use the terms "technical leveling" or "auction techniques",
they do proscribe such activities. The District's regulations provide at 27 DCMR:

       1621.3        The contracting officer shall not assist an offeror to bring its
                     proposal up to the level of other proposals through successive
                     rounds of discussion, such as pointing out weaknesses resulting
                     from the offeror's lack of diligence, competence, or inventive-
                     ness in preparing the proposal.

       1621.4        The contracting officer shall not disclose technical information
                     pertaining to a proposal that results in improvement of a
                     competing proposal.

       1621.5         The contracting officer shall ยทnot indicate to an offeror a cost or
                      price it must meet to obtain further consideration, advise an
                      offeror of its standing relative to another offeror, or otherwise
                      furnish information about any other offeror's price.

We find that the District did not violate 27 DCMR ยง ยง 1621.3, 1621.4 or 1621.5 with regard
to negotiations with Jackson concerning his cost proposal. See also Koba Associates, Inc.,
CAB No. P-350, June 16, 1993, 6 P.D. 5184.

       Even though the issue was not properly raised, we find there were no improper
auction techniques used by the District. An improper auction occurs where the government
advises an offeror of its price standing relative to another offeror. However, the government
may inform an offeror that its cost or price is considered by the government to be too high
or unrealistic. FAR 15.610(e )(2)(ii). Here, the government's letter of April 20, 1992
(Exhibit 7 to Agency Report), and letter of July 3, 1992 (Exhibit 12 of Agency Report),
which addressed Jackson's costs, did not indicate any cost or price that Jackson had to meet
to be considered further and did not advise Jackson of his cost standing vis-a-vis another
offeror or furnish information about another offeror's prices. Therefore, there was no
improper auction technique used here. Crowley Caribbean Transport, B-246784, March
31, 1992, _    CPD , _ .

       Finally, the Board considers Protestor's challenge that there was a cardinal change
to the scope of work under the contract. This Board has recognized and followed the
                                                                                     [5254]


                                            - 12 -      CAB No. P-362, Commercial Recovery, Inc.

standard established by the Federal Claims Court for determining whether a contract
modification is a cardinal charge. In Fort Myer Construction Corporation, CAB No. P-
261(B) 5 P.O. 1060, 1065-1066 (June 10, 1992), the Board, citing Air-A-Plane Corporation
v. United States, 408 F.2d 1030, 1033 (Ct. CI. 1969), held that the standard is whether the
modified job is essentially the same work as the parties bargained for when the .contract was
awarded. Here, the work under the contract remained unchanged, i.e. to prepare and
submit a Discrimination Study On Minority Business Enterprises. The addenda did not
materially change the scope of work or constitute a cardinal charge. See F.F. 1, 4, 5, 8.
Thus, there is no need to re-solicit proposals from all initial offerors. Fort Myer
Construction, supra; American Air Filter, Co., Inc., supra. Protestor's final challenge is also
DENIED.

       Therefore as set forth herein, this protest is hereby DISMISSED, with prejudice, in
part, and DENIED in part. So ORDERED.
