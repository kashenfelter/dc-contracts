        Tricorn Training Institute ("Tricorn"), a non-profit organization providing foster care
services to District youth between the ages of 9 and 21 years, protests the Child and Family.
Services Agency's ("Agency" or "CFSA") failure to provide adequate notice of a solicitation
for the same type of foster care services. The CFSA published a notice of the solicitation in
the Washington Post only twenty-one days before the closing date of the solicitation in
violation of the statutory and regulatory requirements that the publication of notice occur at
least thirty days before the receipt of proposals. Further, the Agency failed to ensure that a
copy of the solicitation was mailed to Tricorn, an incumbent provider. Accordingly, we
sustain the protest.

BACKGROUND

        In September 1991, the Department of Ruman Services ("DRS") awarded a cost
reimbursement contract to Tricorn to provide foster case services to up to ten (10) wards of the
District between the ages of 9 and 21 years "in a nurturing group home setting including,
board and care; clothing; education; vocational training and guidance to help the wards reach
their maximum potential." (protest, Exhibit 2, Contract No. JA/92009). The base contract
period ran from October 1, 1991 until September 30, 1992 with four option years. The
District renewed its contract with Tricorn for each of the four option years until September 30,
1996, the end of the last option term.

        On August 24, 1995, United States District Judge Thomas F. Rogan entered a General
Receivership Order placing the Child and Family Services Division of the DRS under the
control and line supervision of a General Receiver. LaShawn v. Barry, Civil No. 89-1754
(TFH), 1995 WL 520763 (D.D.C.). (Not reported in F.Supp.). The order gave the Receiver
clear authority over the supervision of private vendors under contract to serve members of the
LaShawn class. (protest, Exhibit 1).

       For Fiscal Year 1996, the Receiver, not DRS, exercised the contract option. On
September 30, 1996, at the expiration of the last option term, the Receiver awarded a 120-day
sole source emergency contract to Tricorn for the ten continuing care group home slots. The
sole source contract expired on January 28, 1997. The Receiver awarded Tricorn a second
120-dayemergency sole source contract which expired on April 30, 1997. A third short term
emergency contract was awarded in April and expired on June 30, 1997. (Memorandum in

Opposition to Tricorn's Request For Stay of Contract Award).

        On February 23, 1997, the Agency advertised in the Washington Post that it was
seeking vendors to provide various types of foster care services, including continuing care and
emergency group homes for District youth ages 9 to 21 years. (Agency Report ("AR"),
Attachment 1). The Request for Proposals for Group Homes, RFP GHOI-97 ("RFP"), stated
that the Receiver was seeking residential foster care and therapeutic social services for two
hundred (200) children in need of the continuing care services (more than 30 days), and
residential foster care and social services to one hundred (100) children in need of short term
(30 days or less) emergency residential foster care and social services. The closing date for the
RFP was March 14, 1997. (AR, Attachment 3).

       On May 28, 1997, the Receiver issued notices of contract award to vendors for group
home foster care services. The Receiver established 138 slots for continuing care group homes
divided among six awardees at a cost of $7,341,450.00, and 48 slots for emergency care group
homes divided among three awardees at a cost of $2,604,567. (Addendum to Agency Report
("Addendum") Attachment 9).

         On June 25, 1997, Tricorn received a letter from John M. Oppedisano, Director,
Contracts, Grants & Procurement at CFSA informing Tricorn that its contract for group home
foster care services would end on June 30, 1997. (protest, Attachment 3). The letter stated:
"It is anticipated that the period of transition during which the children currently under your
organization's care are transferred to another contractor will take place over the remainder of
the Summer months." (Jd.) On-June 26, 1997, Tricorn's President wrote to CFSA
procurement staff to request a hearing on what it characterized as a "termination" of its
contract. The letter stated that Tricorn had never received notice of the solicitation. (Protest,
Exhibit 4). On July 3, 1997, Tricorn wrote directly to the Interim Receiver complaining that
Tricorn was never notified about the new solicitation. Further, Tricorn complained about the
lack of any contract to cover the transition period from June 30, 1997 until the children were
removed and about the lack of direction from the Agency on the transition of the foster
children from Tricorn to a new contractor. Despite these letters and numerous follow-up
telephone calls, Tricorn received no response from the Agency. (protest).

       On July 10, 1997, Tricorn filed its protest with the Board requesting that the recently
awarded contracts be terminated; that the contract be readvertised to allow Tricorn, an
incumbent contractor, an opportunity to compete; and that the Agency be directed to stop
performance under an improperly awarded contract. Tricorn also requested that the Agency
execute a written amendment to its current contract to ensure that Tricorn be paid for its
continuing performance. (Protest).

       On July 23, 1997, Tricorn filed a Memorandum in Support of Request for Stay to
prevent the transfer of the youth until the protest was decided. Tricorn argued that the Agency
had awarded only 186 slots, although it had advertised for 300 and that it was not clear that
                                               3               CAB No. P-503, Tricorn Training Institute

there was a contract covering the youth in Tricorn's care. The July 23 Memorandum indicated
that Tricorn received a bilateral modification effective, July 1, 1997, to extend the contract
through September 30, 1997. (Addendum, Attachment 11). On July 30, 1997, the Agency fIled
a Memorandum in Opposition to Tricorn's Request for Stay of Contract Award. The stay
provisions of the recently enacted Procurement Reform Amendment Act of 1996 were not in
effect at the time the protest was fIled. 1 The Board, however, agreed to decide the protest by
the end of the contract extension period of September 30, 1997 to ensure that the children
would not be moved during the pendency of the protest.

        On August 5, 1997, the Agency fIled its Agency Report. Attached to the Agency
Report was a copy of the Washington Post advertisement announcing the solicitation, a copy.of
a vendors' list of current provider's to which the Agency stated it sent notices of the RFP and
a form letter about the RFP dated February 14, 1997. (AR, Attachment 2). Tricorn's name
and address appeared on the list.

        On August 7, 1997, the Board cited to both parties four pertinent cases to narrow the
issues and focus the legal arguments. On August 11, 1997, the Agency fIled an Addendum to
Agency Report, but did not address the four cases.

         On August 20, 1997, Tricorn fIled its comments on the Agency Report. The August 20
fIling included affidavits from the President of Tricorn, Wilbert J. Lewis and Tricorn's Vice-
President of Financing, Mr. Gopal Khatri. Mr. Lewis' affidavit described Tricorn's internal
mail handling procedures and stated that he had never seen the February 14 notice of
solicitation letter from the Agency until after the commencement of the protest. (Comments,
Exhibit 1). Mr. Khatri also stated that he had never seen the February 14 notice of solicitation
from the Agency until after the commencement of the protest. (Comments, Exhibit 2). The
protester also attached affidavits from two other vendors from the Agency's vendor mailing list
who stated that they had never seen the February 14 notice of solicitation letter until Tricorn
showed it to them.(Comments, Exhibits 3 and 4).

       On September 19, 1997, the Agency fIled a Memorandum of Law addressing the cases
the Board had cited and requesting our review of additional cases. Additionally, the agency
attached affidavits of James Osbornes and John Oppedisano describing the agency's procedures



         lThe Procurement Reform Amendment Act of 1996, effective Apr. 12, 1997 (D.C. Law
11-259,44 DCR 1423) for the first time established stay provisions in protests filed with the
Board. Under D.C. Code ยง 1-1189.8(c)(I) if the contracting officer receives notice of the protest
from the Board within 11 business days after the date of award, the contracting officer must
immediately direct the awardee to cease performance under the contract and suspend any related
activities. However, the stay provision did not take effect until 90 days after the effective date of
the act, or on July 11, 1997. The protest was filed with the Board on July 10, 1997 and therefore
the stay provisions were not in effect on the day of filing.

for mailing the February notice of solicitation letter and stated that the February 14 letter was
sent to Tricorn. On September 23, 1997, Tricorn filed a Motion to Strike the September 19
filing of the Receiver arguing that the filing was untimely, was received without a motion for
enlargement of time and occurred a month after the closing of the record just before the Board
had agreed that it would issue its decision. On September 26, 1997, the Board ordered the
Agency to file by September 29, 1997 a motion to enlarge time setting forth the reasons for
the late filing. On September 29, 1997, the Agency filed its motion to enlarge time for the
filing of its memorandum of law. On the day of the filing, the Board held a telephone
conference with the parties to discuss the motion for enlargement of time and motion to strike.
Having considered the arguments of the counsel, the Board found no good cause for the late
filing and granted the protester's motion to strike. The Board also ruled orally that it was
sustaining the protest for the reasons described below.

DISCUSSION

        D. C. Code ยง 1-1183.4(b) requires that: "[p]roposals shall be solicited from the
maximum number of qualified sources and in a manner consistent with the nature of and the
need for the supplies or services being acquired, with adequate public notice of the intended
procurement pursuant to ยง 1-1183.3([c])."2 Section 1-1183.3 (c) provides that: "[a]dequate
public notice of the invitation shall be given at a sufficient time before the date set forth in the
notice for the opening of bids, but shall not be less than 30 days for all contracts." Sections
1300.3 and 1300.4 of 27 DCMR also provides for at least a one-day advertisement in a
newspaper of general circulation a minimum of thirty days before the date set forth for the
receipt of bids or proposals.

        CFSA advertised the foster care proposals in the Washington Post on February 23,
1997 with proposals due on March 14, 1997, a period of 21 days. The record therefore
establishes that the Agency failed to comply with the 30-day notice requirement.

        Section 1300.6 of 27 DCMR also provides that a contracting officer may provide
additional advertisement of solicitations by "[m]ailing a copy of the solicitation to all
prospective bidders or offerors on the bidder's mailing list." The Agency contends that it sent
notices of the solicitations to all current vendors and other providers who had requested that
their names be placed on the mailing list. The protester, however, produced affidavits from
three of the 35 provider organizations on the list which did not receive the notice by mail.
Based on this record the Board concludes that the Agency did not use reasonable care to send
the notice to Tricorn. We find that the Agency failed in its affirmative obligation to use
reasonable methods to disseminate the solicitation document to the maximum number of
qualified sources. Given the sensitive nature of the services, we also find that the Agency



        2D.C. Code ยง 1-1 I 83.4(b) contains a typographical error. It cites ยง 1-1183.3(a) as the
section on adequate public notice, when the correct citation is ยง1-1183.3(c).

should have ensured that all incumbent providers were mailed copies of the solicitation.

        The Board held a telephone conference with the parties on September 30,1997, to
discuss appropriate remedies and corrective actions. The Agency indicated that additional
continuing care group home slots are needed above the ,number awarded in May 1997. The
Agency agreed to extend protester's contract for at least 45 days until a procurement could be
completed. It was also agreed that the Agency will issue a solicitation for at least 10
continuing care group home slots as soon as possible and will advertise the solicitation for at
least 30 days before the date set for the receipt of proposals to allow the protester an
opportunity to compete. The Agency shall also mail a copy of the solicitation to all vendors
on its mailing list as an additional method of advertisement and shall keep records of the
mailing.

       The protest is sustained.
