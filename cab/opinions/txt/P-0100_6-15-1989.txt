and Davis concurring.


                             ISSUE PRESENTED

    The issue presented in this protest is whether the bidder on a tree and
stump removal project presented an adequate surety on the bid bond
accompanying the bid. 1


                               BACKGROUND

    The above· referenced Invitation for Bids (IFB), issued by the Department of
Public Works (DPW) on January 4, 1988, with bid opening on February 8, 1988,
required the submission of a bid bond.

    Bid bonds, as defined in the District of Columbia Procurement Practices Act
of 1985, D.C. Code, § 1·1181.7(5) (1987) (PPA) , provide "a form of security


     lThis case originated during the period when the District of Columbia
Contract Appeals Board was functioning pursuant to Commissioner's Order No.
9, D.C. Code, Supplement V (1987), as amended by Mayor's Order 86-65, 33
DCR 3006 (May 16, 1986). Pursuant to the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of
1985 (PPA) , D.C. Code, § 1·1189.1 (1987), a new independent agency
denominated as the Contract Appeals Board was created. This new Board
became operational on August 1, 1988, and succeeded to the jurisdiction of all
cases pending before the previously established Board.

    assuring that the bidder will not withdraw a bid within the period specified for
    acceptance and will execute a written contract within the time specified in the
    bid."

         Three bids were submitted in response to the IFB: Rock Hard Excavation,
    Inc. (Rock Hard), for $808,100.00, Impex International Industries, Inc. (Impex),
    for $510,030.00, and DRM Associates, Inc. (DRM), the protester, for $563,475.00.
    All bids were rejected and the IFB was cancelled on March 15, 1988 "in the best
    interest of the District." Impex and DRM's bids were rejected because of a
    failure to comply with the bid bond requirement, thereby rendering their bids
    nonresponsive; Rock Hard's bid was rejected as exceeding the District's cost
    estimate by 52.9 percent. Agency Report received by the Board on June 6, 1988
    at 1, 2; exhs. 2, 3 and 4.


                                       OPINION

         DRM's letter of protest, received by the Board on April 7, 1988, raises two
    issues: (1) that Impex, a competitor, neglected to provide a bid bond within its
    bid packet, and (2) that the bid bond submitted by DRM was fully adequate
    except for an attested signature, which was an administrative as opposed to a
    substantive matter. DRM stated that it should be awarded the contract.

        With respect to the first issue, since the District rejected the bid of Impex,
    the protest of DRM concerning Impex's bid is moot. Roofers Incorporated, 1
    P.D. 48 (D.C. CAB 1986).

         With respect to the second issue, the District's rejection of DRM's bid bond,
    DRM's argument is unrelated to the basis for the District's action. DRM's bid
    bond was judged legally insufficient because the sureties were individuals
    (officers of the corporation) rather than a corporate surety as required by 27
    DCMR § 2708.2 (July, 1988), which states:

        A bond security must be obtained from a corporate or individual
        surety; Provided, that an individual surety shall not be used for any
        construction contract in excess of one hundred thousand dollars
        ($100,000).
•



                                          -3 -

        The failure of DRM to provide a legally sufficient surety for this
    construction contract resulted in the finding by the District that DRM's bid was
    nonresponsive. z The protest, therefore, is DENIED.

          lTbe motion to dismiss based on DRM's bid being untimely filed is denied.
    The record does not corroborate the allegation that DRM knew of the basis for
    the rejection of its bid earlier than the receipt of DPW's letter dated March 28,
    1988.
