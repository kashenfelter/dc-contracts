                                           OPINION

         C&E Services, Inc. of Washington ("C&E ") has filed a protest of the revised Emergency
Solicitation No. OMS-7002-AA-AC, challenging the decision of the Department of Public Works
("DPW") cancelling -- after bid opening -- the initial Emergency Solicitation, issued in the small
business set-aside market and reissuing the Emergency Solicitation in the open market. C&E
was low bidder on both the initial and revised solicitation, but lowered its bid price in
responding to the revised solicitation. Relying on the Water and Sewer Authority Establishment
and Department of Public Works Reorganization Act of 1996 (the "WASA Act"), D.C. Law lI-
llI, D.C. Code §§ 43-1661 to 43-1689 (Supp. 1996), which created the District of Columbia
Water and Sewer Authority ("WASA"), and certain provisions of the WASA Act which make
the Procurement Practices Act ("PPA ") inapplicable to WASA procurements, WASA argues that
the Board lacks jurisdiction over this protest. Alternatively, on the merits of the protest, WASA
argues that DPW properly decided to cancel the initial solicitation and issue the revised
solicitation because the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") advised DPW
that use of a set-aside procurement would violate EPA requirements for open competition and
therefore would preclude federal funding.

       We conclude that this procurement was issued by DPW and conducted by DPW under
the terms of the PPA, not the WASA Act. Therefore, the Board has protest jurisdiction. On
the merits, we agree that DPW had a compelling reason for cancelling the initial solicitation and
issuing the revised solicitation in the open market. Accordingly, we deny the protest.

                                            FACTS

       On October 21, 1996, DPW issued the initial Emergency Solicitation No. OMS-7002-
AA-AC in the small business set-aside market, for the procurement of an estimated 900,000
gallons of methanol. (C&E Response, filed January 23, 1997, Tab A; WASA Response, filed
January 13, 1997, Exhibit 1, at 3-13, Exhibit 2, at 1-4). The due date for bids was October 23,
1996. On October 22, 1996, DPW's contracting officer certified the "Findings" section of a
                              •                -2-
                                                                        •                          [7239]

                                                                      C&E Services, Inc., CAB No. P-465

Determination and Findings ("D&F") justifying the need for the emergency procurement. The
first finding cites D.C. Code § 1-1183. 12(a)(1) (" Emergency Procurements ") and 27 DCMR §
1710 ("Emergency Procurements") as authorization for the action. In his findings, DPW's
contracting officer states that "DPW will solicit quotations to obtain the maximum practical
competition." (Id., Exhibit 2). The "Determination section of the D&F states:
                                                       II




       Based on the findings, it is hereby determined that the subject methanol should
       be procured on an emergency basis in accordance with D.C. Code section 1-
       1183. 12(a)(1) and 27 DCMR section 1710, as certified [by DPW's contracting
       officer] above.

The "Determination" is dated October 24, 1996, and signed by the Director of the Department
of Administrative Services ("DAS Director"). By memorandum dated October 24, the DAS
Director returned the executed D&F to the Director of DPW. In the memorandum, the DAS
Director notes that 27 DCMR § 1710.5 limits the period of emergency procurements to a
maximum of 120 days, and the DAS Director directs that the DPW Director ensure that "the
maximum period of this emergency procurement does not exceed 120 days and that you initiate
a separate non-emergency procurement for this requirement . . . . " (Id., Exhibit 2).

        DPW received quotations from three vendors, and the low bid was C&E's at $594,000.
(Id., Exhibit 5). No award was made. Instead, on October 28, 1996, DPW issued Addendum
No.1, revising the initial solicitation by eliminating the small business set-aside restriction and
requesting new bids due that same day at 5:00 p.m. (Id., Exhibit 1, at 1-2; C&E Response,
filed January 23, 1997, Tab A). Apparently, there is no D&F supporting DPW's action of
cancelling the initial solicitation and issuing the revised solicitation. DPW received timely
quotations from five vendors, the three vendors who responded to the initial solicitation plus two
other vendors. C&E was again the low bidder, with an actual bid price of $585,000 and an
evaluated bid price of $514,800. (WASA Motion to Dismiss, filed December 2, 1996, Exhibit
2).

        On October 28, 1996, C&E filed its protest. On November 5, 1996, C&E received
contract award pursuant to the revised emergency solicitation. (WASA Motion to Dismiss,
Exhibit 3). Apparently, there is no written determination of the basis for the selection of C&E.
On December 2, 1996, WASA moved to dismiss the protest on the ground that the WASA Act
and WASA's emergency contracting procedures govern the solicitation and award rather than
the PPA. On December 10, 1996, C&E filed an opposition to the motion arguing that the
solicitation was issued by DPW under the PPA and that WASA has not established its own
procurement system but rather continues to use DPW's Office of Management Services for
conducting its procurement activities. The Board directed WASA to respond to C&E's
opposition and also address the merits of the protest by submitting any determination and
findings supporting DPW's decision to amend the initial solicitation rather than make an award
pursuant to it. (Order and Report on Telephone Conference, dated December 17, 1996). On
January 13, 1997, WASA filed its response. C&E filed a reply on January 23, 1997.

                                        DISCUSSION

I.     Jurisdiction

        To determine whether the PPA confers protest jurisdiction over a particular solicitation,
we must consider the type of contract or agreement contemplated, the nature of the agency
conducting the solicitation, the basis for the procurement or contracting authority, and the
statutory and regulatory scheme which controls the procurement or disposal being solicited.
D.C. Code §§ 1-1181.4, 1-1181.5; Eastern Avenue Development Corp., CAB No. P-437, Sept.
26, 1995, 8 P.D. 7036, 7039; Potomac Capital Investment Corp., CAB No. P-383, Jan. 4,
1994, 41 D.C. Reg. 3885, 3893; Metropolitan Svc. & Maint. Corp., CAB No. P-388, Feb. 7,
1995, 42 D.C. Reg. 4918, 4925-27.

       The PP A governs contracts and solicitations of all agencies of the District government
which are subordinate to the Mayor. D.C. Code § 1-1181.4(c)-(d) (1992). DPW, an agency
subordinate to the Mayor, is covered by the PPA. Created by the W ASA Act, effective April
18, 1996, WASA is an independent authority having a separate legal existence within the District
government. Thus, WASA is not an agency subordinate to the Mayor .. WASA is the successor
to the Water and Sewer Utility Administration ("W ASU A") which was an administration within
DPW. The WASA Act transferred all functions ofWASUA to WASA. D.C. Code § 43-1689
(Supp. 1996). On an interim basis, all assets and liabilities of WASUA were transferred to
WASA. Id.§ 43-1677(e).

        The WASA Act established a Board of Directors to manage WASA. Id. § 43-1674.
Until the initial meeting of the WASA Board, the existing management of WASUA served as
the operator of WASA. Id. § 43-1687(a). The record suggests that the initial WASA Board
meeting occurred on September 26, 1996. (District's January 13, 1997 Response, Exhibit 3,
at 1). After the WASA Board's initial meeting, WASUA was statutorily abolished. D.C. Code
§ 43-1687(a).

       Central to WASA's jurisdictional argument, the WASA Act exempts WASA from the
PPA and the District's Merit Personnel Act once WASA establishes personnel and procurement
systems and promulgates rules and regulations pertaining to the W ASA Board's duties. Entitled
"Procurement system inapplicable, D.C. Code § 43-1684 provides:
                                   II




               Except as provided in section 217(b) [D.C. Code § 43-1687(b)], the
       District of Columbia Procurement Practices Act of 1985 ... shall not apply to
       the Authority [W ASA].

Section 217(b) of the WASA Act, D.C. Code § 43-1687(b), provides in relevant part:

               Until the [W ASA] Board establishes a personnel system and a procurement
       system, and until rules and regulations pertaining to the Board's duties have been
       promulgated, the District of Columbia Procurement Practices Act . . . and the
       District of Columbia Government Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act ... and
       implementing rules and regulations shall continue to apply to the Authority.

                                                                       •                          [7241]

                                                                      C&E Services, Inc., CAB No. P-465

        At its second meeting, held on October 3, 1996, the WASA Board adopted interim
personnel and procurement rules through documents styled as notices of emergency rulemaking.
(Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit 1; District's January 13, 1997 Response, Exhibit 3). WASA's
notice of emergency rulemaking governing its procurement procedures makes the PPA and the
District-wide procurement regulations (Title 27 of the DCMR) generally inapplicable except for
selected chapters and provisions from Title 27 of the DCMR. The notice makes applicable in
whole the provisions of 27 DCMR Chapters 8, 9, 12, 16, 21-25, 27, 31, 33, 36-37, and 42.
The notice makes applicable with modifications portions of 27 DCMR Chapters 13, 15, 17-20,
26, 28, and 32. All chapters made applicable in whole or in part are further modified by the
notice which calls for substituting "WASA" for each reference to the "District" and for
substituting the W ASA Board or the WASA General Manager for references to the Director of
the Department of Administrative Services, depending on the amount of the contract or dispute.
(Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit 1, at 3,15). Chapter 38 of Title 27 of the DCMR, dealing with
protests, claims, and disputes subject to our jurisdiction under the PPA, is omitted. In its place,
the notice provides:

       The right to protest requests for proposals, invitations for bids, specifications and
       awards shall be as specified in the respective document. Generally, appeals will
       be within ten (10) working days and submitted to the [W ASA] Board or General
       Manager, depending on the estimated amount of the contract.

       The right to appeal a decision of the contracting officer will be as specified in the
       contract. GenerallY, appeals from decisions of the contracting officer will be
       within thirty (30) calendar days, and submitted to the [WASA] Board or the
       General Manager, depending on the amount of the Contract or the amount of the
       claim.

(Id., Exhibit 1, at 3, "3-4). During the October 3, 1996 WASA Board meeting, a member
asked for consideration of the dispute resolution provisions. When asked how the WASA Board
would deal with disputes, the meeting minutes record the following interpretation by WASA's
legal counsel:

       [Legal counsel] noted that protests and appeals were handled through Chapter 38
       and indicated that there had been several issues with the DCMR primarily the
       Federal Acquisition Regulations, Chapter 10, and the claims resolution aspect of
       it, Chapter 38. He explained that the interim regulations purport to address both
       sections. He explained that the contract bidding document will include the
       procedure and specify the contract amount, length of time and to whom to file
       protests. He said the same applies for appeals. [He] reminded the Board that for
       existing contracts, some of which are likely to play out over the next three years,
       D. C. has followed the procedure of putting the appeal process into the contract;
       therefore, the Authority still will have to take those existing contracts to the
       Contract Appeals Board.

(District's January 13, 1997 Response, Exhibit 3, at 6).

                                                                     C&E Services, Inc., CAB No. P-465

       Our review of the solicitations at issue here, the manner in which the procurement was
conducted, and the exercise of procurement authority, when measured against WASA's own
interim contracting procedures, convinces us that the initial and revised solicitations were
conducted pursuant to the PPA and the District-wide procurement regulations, not WASA's
interim contracting procedures. Therefore, the WASA Act's exemption from the PPA does not
apply here and we properly exercise protest jurisdiction.

       It is clear that DPW, not WASA, issued both the initial and the revised solicitations and
conducted the procurement. The transmittal pages bear DPW's letterhead. The solicitation
number for the initial and revised solicitations begins with the "OMS" leader, referring to
DPW's Office of Management Services. Addendum No.1, embodying the revised solicitation,
and printed on DPW letterhead, was issued by the Acting Chief of the Contract Support Division
of DPW's Office of Management Services. The initial and revised solicitations contain
references to the "contracting officer" and the "District." There is no mention or reference to
WASA, the WASA Board, or the WASA General Manager. Although WASA argues that DPW
conducted the procurement on behalf of WASA, that alone does not compel the conclusion that
the W ASA Act applies to this procurement. The issue is whether DPW was conducting the
emergency procurement under the PPA or under WASA's interim contracting procedures. We
conclude that DPW conducted the procurement under the PPA .

        .The solicitation language itself shows indicia of a PP A procurement, but no indicia of
a WASA Act procurement or even any reference to either the W ASA Act or the interim
contracting procedures adopted by the WASA Board of Directors. The initial and revised
solicitations incorporate the District's "Standard Contract Provisions for use with the District of
Columbia Supply and Services Contracts" (Dec. 1984). Article 17 of those Standard Contract
Provisions provides for resolution of disputed claims through appeal to our Board. Article 17
does not, standing alone, resolve the question of our protest jurisdiction because the Standard
Contract Provisions do not address protests of agency solicitations or awards. 1 A protest clause
can be found in Article 9 of the District's "Instructions to Bidders" (June 1991). The
solicitations here, however, do not expressly incorporate the "Instructions to Bidders. ,,2
Solicitations should contain a clause clearly advising prospective contractors of their protest
rights, because procurement policy strongly favors, and procurement law usually requires,
prompt assertion and adj udication of protests. 3 The initial and revised emergency solicitations
here contain no protest clause and do not reference any procedures for handling protests.



1 For WASA procurements and contracts exempt from the PPA by virtue of D.C. Code § 43-
1684, WASA may request that we adjudicate its contract disputes or protests, if it enters into
an agreement with the Board pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1181.4(e).

2  C&E notes that in other non-emergency solicitations conducted by DPW for WASA
requirements, the solicitations contain a protest clause directing that protests be filed with us.
(C&E Reply, dated January 23, 1997, Tabs E-F).

3 The minutes of the WASA Board's October 3, 1996 meeting indicates that WASA will, in its
own solicitations and contracts, identify its applicable protest and dispute procedures.
                              •                 -6-
                                                                        •                         [7243]

                                                                      C&E Services, Inc., CAB No. P-465

        Nevertheless, we can see aspects of the procurement that unmistakably were conducted
according to the PPA, and contrary to WASA's interim contracting procedures. For example,
the D&F supporting the need for an emergency procurement is certified by DPW's contracting
officer and is approved by the DAS Director. In taking their certification and approval actions,
the contracting officer and the DAS Director specifically relied on D.C. Code § 1-1183.12(a)(I),
a provision expressly rescinded in WASA's interim contracting procedures. WASA's interim
contracting procedures rescind the applicability of section 312 of the PPA, i.e., D.C. Code §
1-1183.12, and approval of an emergency procurement for a contract of the dollar value
involved here is vested in the WASA Board, not the DAS Director. (Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit
1, at 3, 15.b). The record shows no involvement of the WASA :f3oard. In a October 24,1996
memorandum, the DAS Director directed that the Director of DPW ensure that a "separate non-
emergency procurement for this requirement" be initiated if the need for methanol would
continue after the 120-day maximum period for an emergency procurement pursuant to 27
DCMR § 1710.5. Such a direction is inconsistent with WASA's interim contracting rules which
rescind 27 DCMR § 1710.5 and which make no provision for any action by the DAS Director.

       Based on our conclusion that the procurement was conducted pursuant to the PPA, we
need not address other issues raised by C&E, such as whether W ASA' s interim contracting
procedures constitute a "procurement system" pursuant to D.C. Code § 43-1687(b).

II.    Merits

        WASA argues that even if the Board has protest jurisdiction, the facts compel us to deny
the protest because the District had a compelling reason for cancelling the initial solicitation and
issuing the revised solicitation. Citing a letter from the United States Environmental Protection
Agency, dated May 24, 1996, in which the EPA advised the District that use of a set-aside
procurement would preclude the District from obtaining federal grant funds for paying for the
methanol, the District states that it was proper for DPW to issue the revised solicitation which
placed the procurement in the open market. C&E replies that the contracting officer failed to
execute a D&F supporting its decision to reissue the solicitation in the open market.

        The record does not contain any evidence that the DAS Director or his designee included
in the contract file a written determination supporting the cancellation of the initial solicitation
and the issuing of the revised emergency solicitation in the open market, as required by D.C.
Code § 1-1183.7. The emergency solicitation requirements do not exempt the Director from
complying with D.C. Code § 1-1183.7. For good reason, the PPA requires that:

              Every determination required by this chapter shall be in writing and based
       upon written findings of the public official making the determination. These
       determinations and written findings shall be retained in the official contract file.

D.C. Code § 1-1181.6. The requirements of this section serve the important goals of
documenting the rationale of government actions, enabling meaningful review and management,
assessing accountability, and providing safeguards for the maintenance of a procurement system
of quality and integrity. See id. § 1-1181.1(b).
                              •                 -7-
                                                                         •                        [7244]

                                                                       C&E Services, Inc., CAB No. P-465

       In addition, the District did not include in the record the written determination by the
DAS Director or his designee of the basis for the selection of C&E, as required by D.C. Code
§ 1-1183. 12(a)(3). When the Director or his designee validly determines that circumstances
warrant an emergency procurement pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1183. 12(a), the emergency
procurement requirements and other applicable requirements, including those for written
determinations, as specified in the statute and implementing regulations, cannot be considered
"optional" or less important simply on account of the emergency circumstances.

        Although the lack of a D&F for the cancellation and resolicitation technically violates the
statute, we do not believe that this defect requires us to sustain the protest. The ability to obtain
federal funding, based on the guidance provided by EPA's opinion letter of May 24, 1996,
constituted a compelling reason for the agency to cancel the initial emergency solicitation in the
set-aside market and to revise and reissue the solicitation in the open market. C&E does not
argue to the contrary. See 27 DCMR § 1530.4 (cancellation of IFB after bid opening); Singleton
Electric Co., CAB No. P-411, Nov. 15, 1994,42 D.C. Reg. 4888,4897-98. 4

       Accordingly, we deny the protest.

       SO ORDERED.

4 Because C&E has not challenged the procurement on the issue of whether the DAS Director
or his designee issued a written determination of the basis for the selection of C&E pursuant to
D.C. Code § 1-1183. 12(a)(3), we will not rule on the issue. In addition, we do not consider
whether these solicitations were valid emergency procurements. It suffices to say that the DAS
Director and District contracting officials should consider carefully the standards set forth in
D.C. Code § 1-1183. 12(a)(1) and 27 DCMR §§ 1710.1, 1710.2, and 1710.3 governing the
definition of an "emergency condition" and the circumstances justifying an emergency
procurement. In particular, 27 DCMR § 1710.3(a) provides that in the absence of an emergency
condition, an emergency procurement shall not be justified on the basis of "[t]he lack of
