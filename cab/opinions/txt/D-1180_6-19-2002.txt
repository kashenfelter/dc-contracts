       Under Contract No. 019D01004                        )



                                 OPINION and ORDER


       Appellant, Dixon’s Termite & Pest Control, Inc., (“Dixon”), filed the instant
appeal on June 7, 2002. The appeal alleges a claim for unpaid sums due to Dixon from
VMS, Inc. for work done by Dixon as a subcontractor to VMS, Inc., under a contract
between VMS and the Department of Public Works.

       The Board’s jurisdiction over appeals is limited to “[a]ny appeal by a contractor
from a final decision by the contracting officer on a claim by a contractor, when such
claim arises under or relates to a contract.” D.C. Code §2-309.03(a)(2). “Contractor” is
defined as “any entity that has a direct contract with a District agency” D.C. Code §2-
221.01(1A).

        In a telephone conference, Bob Dixon, President of Dixon, conceded that Dixon’s
contract is with VMS and not the District of Columbia and thus Dixon, with regard to this
claim, is not a “direct contract[or] with a District agency.” The Board thus lacks
jurisdiction over this matter.

    It is therefore, with the consent of the Appellant, this 19th day of June 2002
ORDERED, that the instant appeal be and hereby is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.
