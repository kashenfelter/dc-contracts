                                  OPINION DENYING PROTEST
                                       LexisNexis Filing ID 10982505

        Mont “T” Que Inc. (“MTQ”), has protested the award of a contract to Patch Management, Inc.,
for rental of spray patchers with drivers/operators for pothole patching and road repair services. The
contracting officer rejected MTQ’s bid as nonresponsive because MTQ’s bid price, although apparently
substantially lower than Patch’s bid price, was ambiguous. MTQ’s bid contained hand-written
notations under the price schedule table seemingly identifying prices for materials. The District filed an
Agency Report asserting that the protest was untimely filed and that the decision to reject MTQ’s bid
was correct. We conclude that MTQ timely filed the protest but that the contracting officer properly
determined that MTQ’s bid was ambiguous due to the handwritten annotations on the price schedule
and thus nonresponsive. Accordingly, we deny the protest.

                                           BACKGROUND

        On August 1, 2005, the District’s Office of Contracting and Procurement (“OCP”) issued
Invitation for Bids No. POKT-2005-C-0082-CM on behalf of the District Department of Transportation
(“DDOT”) for the rental of spray patchers with drivers/operators for pothole patching and road repair
services. (Agency Report (“AR”) at 2-3; AR Ex. 1). Section B.2 of the solicitation contemplated a
requirements contract with payment based on fixed-unit prices for specified services. The price
schedule under section B.3 provided as follows:

      Contract   Item Description          Monthly      Estimated Total Rate for 12
      Line Item                            Rental Rates Quantity months Rental Period
      No. (CLIN)
      0001       Rental of spray injection
                 patchers with drivers $ ________ 3               $ ________________
                 /operators and materials
                 for pothole patching and
                 road repair services
                                              -2-                       Mont “T” Que Inc., CAB No. P-0725


       Under the table, was the following:

       Prices shall be effective for a period of one (1) year from date of award. The District
       reserves the right to exercise the option years for three (3) additional years at the same
       price, terms and conditions.

        Bid opening was on September 6, 2005, with bids submitted by MTQ and Patch. (AR Exs. 1
and 2). Patch’s bid for twelve months was $892,800.00, based on a monthly unit price of $24,800. (AR
Ex. 9). MTQ’s price schedule in the bid read as follows:


     Contract  Item Description          Monthly      Estimated Total Rate for 12
     Line Item                           Rental Rates Quantity months Rental Period
     No.(CLIN)
     0001      Rental of spray injection
               patchers with drivers $ 16,000         3         $ 48,000 x 12 =
               /operators and materials                         $576,000
               for pothole patching and
               road repair services

Below the price schedule table, appeared the following handwritten notations made by MTQ:

       Unit Cost
       Diesel Fuel $5.00 per gallon
       Asphalt per ton $48.00
       Liquid TAC $40.00 per 5 gallon bucket

(AR Ex. 3). By memorandum dated September 15, 2005, the contracting officer found MTQ’s bid
nonresponsive “for failure to include the cost for required materials in its unit bid price as required in
Section B of the solicitation.” (AR Ex. 4). The contracting officer requested advice from OCP’s legal
counsel regarding the finding that MTQ’s bid was nonresponsive. (AR Ex. 4). OCP legal counsel
advised OCP to issue a letter to MTQ requesting that MTQ clarify whether it intended to include the
handwritten information below the CLIN No. 0001 price schedule in its bid. (AR Ex. 5). By letter of
October 13, 2005, the contracting officer wrote to MTQ:

       The Office of Contracting and Procurement (OCP) has reviewed your bid submitted in
       response to the above referenced solicitation. OCP is seeking clarification of the
       handwritten information on the Price Schedule page with respect to the instructions
       under Section C.1 of the solicitation.

       Please advise if the handwritten information is to be included in the total bid price.
       Your response should be received in [this] office by October 21, 2005.

(AR Ex. 6). On October 13, 2005, the contract specialist sent the clarification letter to MTQ via United
Parcel Services and UPS confirmed that MTQ received the clarification letter on October 14, 2005.
                                                -3-                       Mont “T” Que Inc., CAB No. P-0725


(AR Ex. 8). On October 13, 2005, the contract specialist also attempted to contact MTQ by telephone
and to fax the letter to MTQ using the numbers provided in its bid. Both telephone numbers in the bid
were disconnected and the fax transmission to the listed MTQ fax number failed. (AR Exs. 2 and 9).
MTQ never responded to the October 13, 2005 clarification letter. On November 9, 2005, the
contracting officer called MTQ and left a voicemail message giving MTQ until close of business on
November 10, 2005, to respond. MTQ did not respond. (AR Ex. 9). By a determination and findings
dated November 23, 2005, the contracting officer decided to award the contract to Patch because
MTQ’s bid was ambiguous as to its total price. (AR Ex. 9). The contracting officer determined that
Patch’s bid of $24,800 per month was fair and reasonable based on the government estimate of $24,500
per month. On December 23, 2005, Patch received award of Contract No. POKT-2005C-0082-CM
pursuant to the solicitation. (AR Ex. 12). On January 5, 2006, the contract specialist mailed to MTQ a
notice of the contract award to Patch which is dated January 4, 2006.

       On January 12, 2006, MTQ filed its protest, alleging that MTQ had the lowest bid price and
should have been awarded the contract. The District filed its Agency Report on February 2, 2006.
MTQ responded to the Agency Report on February 16, 2006. In its response, MTQ claims that its bid
price was $576,000 and that the “handwritten information at the bottom of page 3 – section B.3 had
nothing to do with the bid price in Line item CLIN 0001.”

                                              DISCUSSION

        We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03(a)(1).

        The District argues that the protest is untimely because MTQ should have known the basis of its
protest on October 14, 2005, when it received the October 13 clarification letter. Citing our decision in
Sigal Construction Corp., CAB No. P-0690, et al., Nov. 24, 2004, 52 D.C. Reg. 4243, 4254-56, the
District argues that the clarification letter was “functionally equivalent to an official action taken by the
contracting officer which is adverse to MTQ . . . .” (AR at 6). We do not agree. That communication
from the contracting officer required MTQ to respond, clarifying its bid, but it did not constitute any
adverse action against MTQ. MTQ’s receipt of the January 4, 2006 notice of the award started the 10-
day period for filing its protest. Since MTQ filed its protest on January 12, the protest was timely.

        On the merits, we deny MTQ’s protest because the handwritten notations created an ambiguity
in MTQ’s bid price. “Bids that are indefinite, uncertain, or ambiguous are normally rejected as
nonresponsive.” J. Cibinic & R. Nash, Formation of Government Contracts 569 (3d ed. 1998).
Although the annotations on MTQ’s bid could be interpreted as simply reciting elements already
incorporated in the monthly unit price, it is also reasonable to read the notation as providing the pricing
for road repair materials beyond what is specified in the monthly unit price which would require
additional payment by the District government. Under the latter interpretation, the bid would be
nonresponsive as it did not offer a firm fixed price as required by the IFB. See, e.g., Reid & Gary
Strickland Co., B-239700, Sept. 17, 1990, 90-2 CPD ¶ 222 (notation on Strickland's bid that it had
“allowed $500,000” for doors rendered the bid ambiguous as to price and thus nonresponsive). Section
B.2 of the solicitation required bidders to submit fixed unit prices. MTQ’s handwritten “unit cost”
information on the price schedule page rendered the bid ambiguous as to whether MTQ’s bid included
these handwritten “unit cost” amounts for materials. Since MTQ’s bid was ambiguous as to the total
bid price, the contracting officer properly determined to reject MTQ’s bid as nonresponsive.

      For the reasons discussed above, we deny MTQ’s protest.
