                                OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS


                   On September 28, 1994, DK&R Company ("DK&R" or "Protestor") filed both a letter
            of protest and a document titled OIMotion to Protest Against Contract Award with the Board.
                                                                                              Ol



            DK&R is protesting the award of Invitation for Bids No. 3184-AA-76-2-CW (OIIFB").

                    The Board dismisses this protest due to its untimely filing.


            I. Statement of Facts

                    On October 21, 1993, the IFB was issued in the small business enterprise (OISBE OI ) set-
            aside market by the Department of Administrative Services (OIDAS OI ) on behalf of the Office of
            Financial Management for various types of computer paper, computer print-out paper, bond
            paper and copier paper. The IFB was for a firm fixed-unit price, estimated requirements
            contract. Addendum No. 1 to the IFB was issued on October 26, 1993. This addendum
            extended the bid opening date from November 23, 1993 to December 1, 1993 at 2:00 p.m.
            District's Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit 1.

                    The IFB consisted of an aggregate award group with eight (8) separate, specific items.
            In addition to the type of paper required (i.e., computer print-out paper, continuous feed, plain,
            white bond paper for laser only, size 12 01 x 81
                                                           /2" inches, one (1) part, right and left perforations,
            basis weight sub. 20 lbs.) each item stated requirements for both the quantity of paper per carton
            of paper supplied and the total number of cartons (i. e., 4,000 sheets per carton; quantity --
            3,600; unit -- carton). In addition, the quantity of paper per carton varied among the items
            whose unit measure was a carton. Id.

District of Columbia Register                                                                              AUG 25 1995


                                                            -2-                   CAB No. P-422, DK&R Company


                     The bid opening date was December 1, 1993. [d., Addendum No. 1. The District
              received bids from twelve (12) bidders, including DK&R. [d., Exhibit 3.

                      Although the bids were opened on December 1, 1993, DAS' Determination and Findings
              for Award to Other Than the Lowest Bidder ("D&F") was not preliminarily executed by the
              Contracting Officer until April 21, 1994 -- more than four months later. On May 23, 1994, the
              D&F was executed by the Director of DAS. After reviewing the bids, DAS had de~rmined in
              tum that the four (4) apparent low bidders were non-responsive to the IFB and, therefore,
              ineligible for award. [d.

                     The fifth apparent low bidder was determined to be responsive to the IFB. In accordance
             with 27 DCMR §1531.1, the Director of DAS recommended that, in the best interests of the
             District, award should be made to the fifth lowest bidder.

                     By letter dated February 28, 1994, DAS "
                                                            requested and received an extension of time for
             the acceptance of District Hea1thcare's bid. In toto, DAS requested and received six time
             extensions. The final extension of time to accept the bid expired on September 2, 1994.
             District's Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit 4.

                     Accordingly, on September 2, 1994, Contract No. 3184-AA-76-2-CW was awarded to
             District Hea1thcare. [d. On that date, Protestor was notified by a letter from the Contracting
             Officer of the award of the solicitation to District Hea1thcare. [d., Exhibit 5.


             ll. Procedural History

                    In its letter filing, Protestor alleged that DAS "bent over backwards to accommodate [the
             awardee] by postponing the award on numerous occasions for about a year. II In its "Motion,"
             Protestor further alleged that the contract was improperly awarded "in violation of 12 C.F.R.
             §121.1603(a)(2)." Protestor requested that the Board "freeze and void the [contract] award
             immediately and resubmit the bid .... II

                     On October 31, 1994, the District fIled a Motion to Dismiss the Protest. The District
             stated that the protest should be dismissed, with prejudice, on the following grounds: (1)
             Protestor failed to set forth a clear and concise statement of the legal and factual grounds of its
             protest as required by Board Rule 302.1(c), 36 D.C. Reg. 2711 (April 21, 1989); and (2)
             Protestor's bid was deficient and non-responsive to the IFB, thus, Protestor was not in a position
             to be awarded the contract should the protest be sustained, and therefore, since DK&R is not
             an aggrieved or interested party, it has not filed a sustainable protest of the contract award.
             D.C. Code §§ 1-1189.3(1) and 1-1189.8(a).

                      On November 7, 1994, Protestor filed a Motion to Compel Discovery. Protestor stated
             that it needed, among other requests, "an abstract of the price quotes of the four top finalist[s]"

                                                            -3-                  CAB No. P-422, DK&R Company


              to enable it to determine whether the awardee, District Healthcare, was "in good standing" when
              it was awarded the contract in question. In addition, Protestor alleged that the D & F issued by
              DAS (see discussion above) had been "back dated" by DAS officials which allowed District
              Healthcare to, in effect, be pre-selected for the contract award. Protestor, citing inapplicable
              Federal regulations, also requested a hearing on this matter. In addition, Protestor apparently
              intended this filing to serve as its response to the District's Motion to Dismiss. In response to
              the District's Motion to Dismiss, Protestor stated that it should not have been determined non-
              responsive for failing to return the entire bid package. See Protestor's Motion to Compel
              Discovery.

                       On November 14, 1994, Protestor submitted a memorandum to the Office of the
              Corporation Counsel, with a copy to the Board, clarifying Protestor's discovery request.
              Protestor sought: (1) copies of delivery tickets from the awardee's deliveries under the
              contract; (2) a copy of the awardee's "Certificate of Good Standing" issued by the District; and
              (3) a log of communications up to and including September 2, 1994, both written and oral,
              between the District and the awardee regarding the contract at issue. On November 16, 1994,
              Protestor fIled a "Memorandum" suggesting options for the resolution or settlement of the instant
              protest.

                     The District filed its response to Protestor's Motion to Compel Discovery on November
              18, 1994. First, the District opposed Protestor's request by asserting that the discovery request
             does not meet the Board's criteria as established in Board Rule 112.3, 36 D.C. Reg. 2693 (1989)
             and Board Rule 309.2, Id. at 2713. The District contends that, until the jurisdictional issues
             raised in its Motion to Dismiss are considered and resolved by the Board, Protestor's discovery
             request would be premature. Second, the District pointed out that Protestor has based its motion
             on Federal regulations that do not apply to protests before the Contract Appeals Board. Third,
             the District asserted that the Protestor has raised issues of contract administration that are not
             subject to the Board's review. Fourth, the District asserted that, by alleging that officials at
             DAS "back dated" the D & F, the Protestor has misinterpreted the plain meaning of the
             D & F document.

                     On January 3, 1995, Protestor flled a Response to the District's Opposition to Compel
             Discovery in which Protestor restated the grounds for its discovery request.


             m.    Discussion


                     As indicated in the Statement of Facts above, on September 2, 1994, D AS issued a letter
             notifying all bidders of the award of Contract No. 3184-AA-76-2-CW to District Healthcare and
             Janitorial Supply, Inc. On September 28, 1994, Protestor filed a protest of the award with the
             Board. This protest is dismissed with prejudice based upon the fact that it was untimely filed.

                       Section 908 (b) of the PP A, D. C. Code § 1-1189.8 (b), states that "the aggrieved person
              shall file a protest with the Board within 10 working days after the aggrieved person knew or
              should have known of the facts and circumstances upon which the protest is based." Chesapeake

              CAB No. P-263, August 31, 1993, 41 D.C. Reg. 3615. The Board's rules, which serve to
              implement the PPA, require that a protest be filed not later than ten working days after the basis
              of the protest is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier. Rule 301.1, 36 DCR
              2710 (1989); Anne Robertson Sellin, CAB No. P-238, July 2, 1991, 39 D.C. Reg. 4247.

                     This ten-day filing requirement is a prerequisite to this Board's jurisdiction and cannot
              be waived. Macton Construction, Inc., CAB No. P-203, December 19, 1991, 39 D.C. Reg.
              4368 citing MTI Construction Co., Inc., D.C. CAB (June 1, 1987) and Southern International
              Corp., D.C. CAB (February 27, 1987).

                      Even adding in six total days for mailing purposes (three days for both the mailing of the
              notice to Protestor from DAS ami for the mailing of Protestor's filing with the Board), Protestor
              does not meet the lO-day filing requirement.

                     Due to Protestor's untimely filing of its protest, the Board is without jurisdiction to
              consider the merits of this protest.



                     ACCORDINGLY, based upon the facts, legal precedent and reasoning set forth above,
              the protest is hereby DISMISSED, with prejudice.
