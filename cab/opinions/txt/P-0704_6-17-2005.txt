                                           LexisNexis Filing ID 6042267

        SAGA Adventures, Inc. filed a protest on March 24, 2005, against awards made as of
July 1, 2004, under a solicitation issued by the Child and Family Service Agency (“CFSA”) for
Independent Living Main Facilities Programs (Solicitation Line Item Number 0001CA) on the
basis that SAGA was given insufficient time to obtain the required Independent Living Program
License prior to award and that it was thus at a competitive disadvantage to other offerors who
were given longer notice of the license requirement. The District moved to dismiss the protest as
untimely. We agree with the District and dismiss the protest.

                                                 DISCUSSION

        The solicitation was initially issued July 28, 2003, requesting submission of proposals no
later than September 10, 2003. (§ L.3.1). The solicitation scheduled a bidders’ conference on
August 12, 2003. Amendment 1 to the solicitation was issued August 29, 2003. The amendment
responded to questions asked at the bidders’ conference, including notice of licensing
requirements, and extended the date for submission of proposals to September 17, 2003. (§ T).
SAGA submitted its proposal on September 17, 2003.1 A current Independent Living Program
(“ILP”) license was not required to submit a proposal; however, such a license was required
before award. (Agency Report “AR” Ex. 10).

   Protester asserts that it did not receive Amendment 1. The Board notes that this is unlikely since SAGA’s
proposal was filed on the extended due date. Whether or not SAGA received the amendment, however, is not
material. “Normally, a prospective contractor bears the risk of not receiving a solicitation amendment, unless it is
shown that the contracting agency made a deliberate effort to prevent the firm from competing, or even if not
deliberate there is evidence (other than non-receipt by the protester) that the agency failed to provide the amendment
after the firm availed itself of every opportunity to obtain it.” (Southern Maryland Restoration, Inc, CAB No. P-
0459, Sept. 20, 1996, 44 D.C. Reg. 6503)

        SAGA’s proposal was in the competitive range, with deficiencies2 noted in a letter dated
November 24, 2003. SAGA corrected the deficiencies. On February 18, 2004, CFSA requested
a Best and Final Offer from SAGA. On March 18, 2004, CFSA sent SAGA and all other
offerors lacking an ILP license a letter indicating that within sixty (60) days of the date of the
letter offerors needed to obtain a license for the Independent Living Program – Main Facilities
Congregate Care. (AR Exs. 4 and 6). On May 27, 2004, SAGA sent CFSA a letter requesting
an extension of time to comply with the licensing requirement. (AR Ex. 7). CFSA never
responded to the request. However, since the license was not granted to SAGA until August 5,
2004, well after the requested extension would have run and after award of the contracts was
determined, the issue of the requested extension is moot.

        SAGA learned sometime before July 8, 2004 that it would not be awarded a contract. On
July 8, 2004, SAGA sent the Contracting Officer a letter requesting that CFSA reconsider its
decision not to award a contract to SAGA, specifically referencing the limited time it was
allowed to obtain the ILP license. (AR Ex. 8). On August 11, 2004, SAGA sent Robert Bobb,
City Administrator, a letter in which SAGA alleges mistreatment by CFSA. (AR Ex. 9). On
August 18, 2004, CFSA sent SAGA a letter specifically advising SAGA that its ineligibility for
award was based on its failure to timely obtain the required license3. (AR Ex. 10).

       On December 23, 2004, SAGA made a FOIA request on the contract awards and on
March 14, 2005, CFSA provided the requested FOIA documents. (AR Ex. 13). On March 24,
2005, SAGA filed the instant protest with the Board.

        The essence of SAGA’s protest is “the disparity in treatment of Protester [with regard to
the requirement for an ILP license] in comparison with the other Offerors similarly situated.”
(Protest ¶ 29). Although the FOIA response to SAGA included some specific details as to
alleged disparate treatment, namely that other proposers may have been reminded of the license
requirement earlier4 than SAGA, which permitted other proposers to timely obtain the required
license, while SAGA was unable to obtain the license before contract award, the basis of the
protest was clearly known to SAGA on July 8, 2004, when it complained to the contracting
officer as to the unfairness of the time it was allowed to obtain the requisite license. SAGA
repeated these complaints to the City Administrator in a letter dated August 11, 2004. SAGA

  Although the District was aware that SAGA had not applied for the proper license (Protest Ex 11), the deficiency
letter did not mention this failure. While technically correct that the lack of the license was not a “proposal’
deficiency, since the license was not required until award, the agency could have improved competition by advising
proposers of the licensing requirement.
3
  It is not clear why CFSA did not send formal notification of the rejection of SAGA’s proposal until January 14,
2005. (AR Ex. 12).
4
   The evidence included in the FOIA response was a copy of a memo apparently written in November 2003
purporting to indicate that a group of proposers, including SAGA, had been sent notice that the ILP license was
required. (Protest Att. H). SAGA alleges that it did not receive this notice. The contracting officer has, contrary to
the memo, denied that such notice was ever sent, asserting that the only notice to any contractor was sent March 18,
2004. (Affidavit ¶ 4, AR Ex. 3).
                                               -3-             SAGA Adventures, Inc., CAB No. P-0704


was specifically advised by letter dated August 18, 2004 that it was ineligible for award due to its
failure to have the license by July 1, 2004. (AR Ex. 10). At that point it was clear that SAGA
would not receive an award of a contract.

        To invoke the jurisdiction of the Board, “protests shall be filed not later than 10 business
days after the basis of protest is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.” (§2-
309.08(b)(2)). To begin the statutory jurisdictional time period, such knowledge need only be
sufficient information upon which to base a protest. “[A] protester may not wait until it obtains
additional information under FOIA pertaining to the protest before filing if it is already
reasonably aware of the protest basis. Sperry Corp., B-225492; B-225492.2, Mar. 25, 1987, 87-1
CPD ¶ 341.” Oak Ridge Associated Universities, Recon. B-238411.2, May 31, 1990, 90-1 CPD
¶ 513.

        SAGA knew that it would not be awarded the contract and knew the basis of its protest
no later than its receipt of the contracting officer’s letter of August 18, 2004. Its protest filed
over 7 months later was clearly untimely. The protest is dismissed.

       SO ORDERED.
