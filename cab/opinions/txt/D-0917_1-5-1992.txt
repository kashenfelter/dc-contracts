                                        ORDER

        Notice of Appeal in CAB No. 0-917 was filed on May 22, 1992,

and the complaint was filed'on June 26, 1992.                    The District filed
                                   1/
its answer on July 31, 1992.-            st. John's thereafter filed a line
of dismissal on December 23, 1992.                By Order dated December 29,
1992, the Board dismissed CAB No. 0-917, without                     prejudice.

        Subsequently, on December 31,           1992, the District filed its

response to st. John's line of dismissal stating that it has no

objection to dismissal, but requests that the dismissal be with
prejudice.
        Pursuant to Board Rule 121.2,           a dismissal initiated by an
appellant    after   an   answer   has     been    filed,       as   here,   shall   be

approved by the Board,       "            upon terms and conditions as it

deems    proper."    36   OCR    2697.      The    Board        further   notes   that

Appellant is not entitled as a matter of right to a voluntary



     liThe above-captioned cases were consolidated by the Board by
Order dated August 13, 1992.

dismissal or dismissal without prejudice because the answer has

been filed, and because there is no joint stipulation.                         Because we
now     have   a    request      from    a    defendant,     who      has   answered   the
complaint, that the appeal be dismissed with prejudice, the Board

is    persuaded          that   the    dismissal       should    be    with    prejudice.

Therefore,         the    Board's     Order    of     December   29,    1992   is   hereby

amended so that dismissal is with prejudice.

        So ORDERED.
