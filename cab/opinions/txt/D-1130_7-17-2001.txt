AMENDMENT TO ORDER ON APPELLEE’S MOTION FOR STAY OF PENDING APPEAL

        By order dated March 28, 2001, in order to insure an orderly presentation of this matter
before the Board, as amended by order dated May 22, 2001, the Board stayed all action in this
proceeding until July 1, 2001. The Board has been informed by counsel for the District “that the
parties are continuing their settlement discussions.”

        Based on the representation of counsel, the Board amends the order of March 28, 2001 to
extend the stay in this matter until July 27, 2001. The order of Marcy 28, 2001, was conditioned
upon the “OCFO notify[ing] each of its own personnel who have had any relationship to the subject
contract, as well as personnel at each other District agency or non-District entity who have had any
relationship to the contract, of the pendency of this matter before the Board and direct that such
persons maintain and preserve any document, record or information, in any form, directly or
indirectly related to performance of the subject contract.” The duty to maintain and preserve re
cords with regard to the subject contract continues during the extended stay.


        SO ORDERED.
