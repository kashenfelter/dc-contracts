                           DECISION AND MEMORANDUM OPINION
                                           Filing ID 53755235

         This is a dispute action brought by Adsystech, Inc. (Adsystech or appellant) against the
District (District or appellee) alleging the non-payment of $757,470 for services rendered to
upgrade the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs’ (DCRA) information
technology systems with the “Hansen Version 7 PERMITS” software (Hansen or Hansen
upgrade). Appellant seeks an equitable adjustment on the grounds that constructive changes
were directed and/or ratified by authorized District officials. The appellant also seeks recovery
under common law theories of promissory estoppel and quantum meruit. The District contends
that (i) the Anti-Deficiency Act bars payment, (ii) the mandatory ratification procedures required
by former D.C. Code § 2-301.05(d)(5) were not followed herein, (iii) former D.C. Code § 2-
301.05(d)(3) bars oral contracts, (iv) equitable adjustment cannot be invoked to authorize a
payment exceeding a District purchase order, and (v) the Board lacks jurisdiction over quantum
meruit claims. The Board conducted a trial from June 21-22, 2010, hearing testimony from five
witnesses called by the parties.1

       Upon review of the record herein, and for the reasons set forth more fully below, the
Board finds that the appellant is entitled to an equitable adjustment for services it performed in
excess of the parties’ contract at the request of authorized District officials. This case is
remanded to the appellee for a determination of quantum. The Board directs the parties to
negotiate in good faith, and to inform the Board of the disposition status within 30 days.

                                              BACKGROUND

        The backdrop to the instant dispute is as follows. During the latter part of 1999, the

1
  The trial was conducted by a previous Board panel; none of whom are presently members of the Board. The
present Board panel has reviewed the trial transcript, appeal file, appeal file supplement, hearing exhibits, post
hearing briefs, and the entire record herein in rendering this decision.

DCRA sought to acquire a new information technology system to replace its antiquated
department hardware and applications as part of the District’s Y2K initiative.2 Hr’g Tr. vol. 2,
448:15-452:20, June 22, 2010. Based on a KPMG study of commercial-off-the-shelf products
and the results of a pilot program with Adsystech, DCRA decided that the Hansen software was
the best available product. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 17:4-19:7, June 21, 2010. The Hansen software was
a suite of municipal government products which offered a permit and licensing function sought
by DCRA. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 18:15-20. Adsystech’s CEO described the software as a “blank sheet
of paper” which provides a “framework and a structure” that a vendor develops into a workable
product for a particular client. Hr’g Tr. vol. 243:1-244:10.

        From the outset, the parties agreed that DCRA’s total system upgrade would entail the
implementation of 221 processes within DCRA at an estimated cost that exceeded $2 million
dollars. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 19:8-22:5; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 459:6-463:7. The 221 processes were derived
from the KPMG study. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 228:22-231:13. The record denotes the 221 processes
were divided among DCRA’s internal administrations as follows: Building Land Regulation
Administration (BLRA)(78 processes), Business Regulation Administration (BRA)(102
processes), and Housing Regulation Administration (HRA)(41 processes). Appellee’s Hr’g Ex.
3; see also Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 231:3-232:18.

        Because DCRA only had $711,000 in funding, the parties decided to procure the Hansen
upgrade through two contracts issued across separate fiscal years.3 Hr’g vol. 1, 24:19-25:8;
26:18-46:1; 60:2-62:22; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 464:10-465:4. The first contract was entered into on
June 18, 1999, for $711,039 (first contract or June 18 contract).4 Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 6; see
also Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 16:1-18:3; 22:20-25:8. The parties agreed that Adsystech would only
implement 11 of the 221 processes under the first contract. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 22:20-25:8; 58:2-
59:4, 59:15-60:6. See also Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3, Task 7. Neither party has presented the Board
with a complete original or copy of the June 18 contract. The contract originally consisted of 10
pages, yet only the first page has been entered into our record.

       The second contract was entered into on October 25, 1999 (second contract or October 25
contract) through a “Purchase Notification” for $476,317.5 Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 7; see also Hr’g
Tr. vol. 1, 61:12-63:1. The appellant contends that the second contract was a “time and
materials” contract. Appellant’s Post Hr’g Br. 7-8, Proposed Finding of Fact 21. The District’s

2
  Y2K refers to the Year 2000. As Y2K approached during 1998-2000, most public and private sector entities were
undertaking massive computer system upgrades to prevent service lapses as they anticipated that most computers
would not recognize dates beyond the year 1999. See discussion infra at p.19.
3
  Adsystech’s Director of business development offered an alternative explanation for why the Hansen procurement
was done in “bite-size chunks.” He testified that the procurement was separated in “order to not take it to the Control
Board[,]” which he testified was a requirement for contracts over $1 million dollars. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 463:9-464:9.
4
  Adsystech’s CEO testified that the June 18 contract was a firm-fixed price contract. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 71:12-13. This
contention is not disputed by the District. Appellee’s Post Hr’g Br. 7, Proposed Finding of Fact 3.
5
   The Board defines the “purchase notification” herein as a contract. At all times material to the instant dispute, the
definition of “contract” included “task order” and “purchase order.” D.C. Code § 2-301.07(13)(B),(D) (repealed
Apr. 8, 2011). Interestingly, the District identifies the purchase notification as a “contract” in its October 25, 1999,
transmittal to the Council of the District of Columbia. See Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 5. Per the record, “purchase
notification” is described as a term used interchangeably with “purchase order.” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 501:8-502:2.
District witness Bruce Witty, the contracting officer herein, stated that a purchase notification becomes a “contract”
once performance begins. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 506:13-507:15.
                                                        -3-                     Adsystech, Inc., CAB No. D-1210



post-hearing brief disputes this, but at trial its key witness testified that in paying Adsystech’s
invoices, the District had treated the contract as a time and materials one. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 508:16-
509:14. The parties agreed that Adsystech would implement the remaining 210 processes under
the second contract. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 61:12-63:1.6 The second contract consists of only one-page,
and provides very minimal scope, stating that Adsystech’s services are for “continuation of
[s]ervices for Task #2 on Enterprise Systems to complete [a]ll departments.” Appellant’s Hr’g
Ex. 7; AF Ex. 2; Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 61:12-63:1.

        Before proceeding further with a detailed discussion of contract terms and performance,
it is important to note that Adsystech’s required performance under both contracts was grounded
upon the statement of work developed for the June 18 contract. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 22:6-24:7; 41:9-
16; vol. 2, 311:21-313:11; 501:8-503:2. We have relied on the June 18 statement of work for
that purpose as well because the original contract has been lost. It is well settled that parol
evidence is admissible to establish the terms of a lost or missing contract (or instrument), where
a party testifies that the contract has been lost, and the substance of the agreement is proved
satisfactorily by the parol evidence. See Tayloe v. Riggs, 26 U.S. 591 (1828); Edmunds v. Jelleff,
127 A.2d 152 (D.C. 1956). In this case, it is clear that the contract has been lost. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2,
500:2-505:14. Moreover, we believe that the statement of work for the June 18 contract
sufficiently proves the contract terms herein, and note that the appellee has not disputed such.
Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3.

        Thus, we find the statement of work admissible and competent to establish the contract
terms entered into by the parties herein. The referenced statement of work outlines 10 Tasks that
Adsystech was to perform to complete DCRA’s upgrade to the Hansen system. Appellee’s Hr’g
Ex. 3. These tasks included, but were not limited to, a kick-off meeting, the development of a
project implementation plan, acquisition of licenses for the Hansen software, training,
Adsystech’s review and validation of DCRA delivered “as is” process flows,7 data conversion,
etc. Id.

       Following the parties execution of both contracts, Adsystech was able to begin
performance on DCRA’s system overhaul.8 Once performance began, however, Adsystech was
advised by DCRA official “Theresa Lewis” (Lewis) not to use the KPMG study to complete the
“to-be” processes of the Hansen upgrade.9 Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 52:16-53:11, 55:16-56:8; 63:19-65:4;
219:5-220:20; 233:22-234:20. The KPMG study was deemed “horrible” as to the Business
Regulation Administration, “fair” as to the Housing Regulation Administration, and “very
reasonable” as to the Office of Adjudication’s requirements. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 358:18-362:11.

        The record suggests that there were numerous District officials with whom Adsystech

6
   See also Appellant’s Post Hr’g Br. 7-8, Proposed Finding of Fact 21; Appellee’s Post Hr’g Br. 7, Proposed Finding
of Fact 4.
 7
    An “as-is” process flow is one that documents how DCRA conducted business prior to the Hansen
implementation. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 227:18-228:3 (testimony of the Adsystech project manager).
8
   Adsystech’s project manager testified that prior to execution of the second contract, Adsystech’s performance
consisted of procuring the Hansen licenses, tools, and maintenance agreement. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 320:11.
9
   A “to be” process identified how DCRA wanted to conduct its business operations in the future. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1,
234:21-235:10 (Adsystech project manager). As context, the Adsystech project manager explained that DCRA did
not want to pay Adsystech to implement a system that needed to be changed in later years. Id. at 235:7-9.
                                                        -4-                      Adsystech, Inc., CAB No. D-1210



dealt during the life of the contract. The parties’ June 18 contract was signed by “Richard P.
Fite” as contracting officer, although Fite disappears from the record completely thereafter.
Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 6. The parties’ October 25 contract was signed by “Suzanne J. Peck” as
contracting officer. Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 7. At the time, Peck was also the District’s Chief
Technology Officer. Id. Bruce Witty is also identified as a contracting officer herein but testified
that he “struggl[ed] with that role because he signed no contracts[.]” Hr’g Tr. Vol. 2, 491:3-15.
Adsystech’s project manager10 testified that no one identified themselves as contracting officer
on the DCRA contract. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 440:6-13.

        The above notwithstanding, Theresa Lewis emerges as the one District official exercising
day-to-day authority over all aspects of the Hansen upgrade contract. Although she did not
testify at the hearing, she is described by appellant’s and appellee’s witnesses alike as the
singular District official in charge of the upgrade. Adsystech’s project manager described Lewis
as “the one point person appointed by the [DCRA] Director” for the project, “the key person in
charge of all of the various DCRA divisions” acquiring the Hansen system, and the person
exercising “direction or control” over the parties’ contract. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 238:10-17; 438:22-
442:20. Adsystech’s project manager further testified that contracting officer Bruce Witty
“confirmed Theresa Lewis as the person for all requirements[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 239:13-240:19.
Adsystech’s business development director testified that “Theresa knew DCRA like the back of
her hand. She understood all the applications… knew exactly how things were managed, run.
She was just a wealth of knowledge[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 465:15-466:8. He also described Lewis
as the “gatekeeper” and the “one that knew and approved everything[.]” Id.

        Ms. Lewis was similarly described by the District’s two witnesses, contracting officer
Bruce Witty and former DCRA Deputy Director and Interim Director Carlynn Fuller (Fuller or
Interim Director).11 Witty testified that Lewis was the contracting officer’s technical
representative. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 536:16-537:3. Fuller testified that, “because of the nature of the
project and the areas that were being affected by the project, it was Theresa Lewis’ project
because most of the areas with the exception of one fell under her role as Deputy Director[.]”
Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 536:16-538:22; 592:1-19.

        In lieu of the KPMG study, Adsystech was directed by Lewis to work directly with
designated DCRA staff to “extract and develop” the requirements of DCRA’s system through
incremental mapping. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 65:5-67:4; 240:20-242:22. The project manager testified
that implementation of the Hansen system using the KPMG study would have been inadequate,
and that the input of DCRA employee stakeholders was required for “additional extraction
work.” Id. at 228:14. Adsystech testified that mapping DCRA’s system in this manner added
more work and cost/scheduling changes. Id., 67:14-71:1. For example, Adsystech’s project
manager testified that DCRA stakeholders “had full time job[s] providing and delivering
licenses” and were not available to fill in mapping details. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 243:1-244:21. The
project manager also testified that DCRA stakeholders either did not show up for meetings, or
10
   Roland Gillis testified that he was Adsystech’s “chief person, officer over the whole contract[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 1,
246:3-9. For ease of reference, Mr. Gillis is referred herein as Adsystech’s project manager.
11
   Carlynn Fuller served as DCRA’s Interim Director from September 2000 to April 2001. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 590:11-
591:5. Prior to that, she served a variety of roles at DCRA, including Chief of Staff and Deputy Director for
Operations. Id. Fuller became involved in the Adsystech contract matter around March 2000 as a result of Adsystech
“running out of money.” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 592:20-593:14.
                                                        -5-                     Adsystech, Inc., CAB No. D-1210



that the “wrong people” were at meetings. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 362:17-363:16. Thus, the project
manager testified that Adsystech’s work with line staff required “more labor” than anticipated.
Hr’g Tr. Vol. 1, 244:7-10; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 356:15-19 (the District’s failure to deliver to-be
processes in an efficient manner caused Adsystech to perform extra work).

        By January 2000, Adsystech became aware that its Hansen upgrade contract was running
out of funds. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 69:2-10; 88:3-89:14; 89:19-90:19. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 467:17-469:5.
During the course of the contract, Adsystech officials had direct communications regarding the
funding shortage with contracting officer Peck, the DCRA Director, Lewis, and Witty (who had
been tasked by Peck to address the funding issue). Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 89:5-92:5; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2,
472:8-473:7. The Adsystech CEO also testified that Adsystech made bi-weekly status reports to
DCRA after he alerted them to the concern about the funding shortage. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 84:12-
85:3; see also Appellee’s Hr’g Exs. 19-21.

        Notwithstanding the funding shortage, Adsystech was requested by various District
officials to continue performance because the Hansen upgrade had not been fully implemented as
of January 2000. Adsystech’s business development director testified that contracting officer
Peck and DCRA official Lewis told Adsystech to stay on the job. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 482:12-17;
482:22-483:1. Neither Peck nor Lewis testified at the hearing. Adsystech’s business
development director testified that other District officials requested it to stay on the job as well
including, contracting officer Witty, the DCRA Director, its Interim Director, and James Brady
(a District official designated as contracting “specialist” before Witty assumed the role of
contracting officer). Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 472:8-473:7; 481:11-484:2.

         Other hearing evidence established that several District officials with knowledge of the
funding shortage failed to direct Adsystech to stop work. Adsystech’s business development
director testified that contracting officer Witty knew that Adsystech worked on the DCRA
project throughout 2000. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 483:6-484:2. Witty himself testified that in “August,
September of 2000[,]” contracting officer Peck asked him to “get involved in the [DCRA
Hansen] contract to find out where it is going at the time they were running without funds and I
was to see what I could do to help out…” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 491:16-492:8. Witty testified further
that he was aware that Adsystech was “definitely performing work” at DCRA in August 200012.
Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 531:3-18. Nonetheless, Witty testified that he did not issue a stop work order
because, I’m not in a position to say absolutely stop work and then have my butt kicked because
I stopped something that was in process or ready to go[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 527:9-528:4. Witty
testified further that, “[t]here are ways, at that time especially, to do a ratification to cover that,
so I didn’t want to be the person to stop it at that point[.]” Id.; 528:5-8.

       Adsystech’s project manager also testified that Lewis never instructed Adsystech to stop
work because the contract funds were exhausted. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 265:9-20.13 Further, DCRA’s
Interim Director conceded that she too “never told them to stop working” although she knew

12
   Witty acknowledges that he worked on two Adsystech contracts during this period but his testimony is clear that
he was aware of the instant contract during the August 2000 period. Id.
13
   In fact, the Adsystech project manager testified that no District official ever advised Adsystech to stop contract
performance, including Lewis, contract officers Peck and Witty, Office of Contracting and Procurement contracting
specialist James Brady, and DCRA senior official Carlynn Fuller. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 265:9-20.
                                                        -6-                      Adsystech, Inc., CAB No. D-1210



Adsystech employees were working on site at DCRA. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 612:1-614:3.14

        In addition to the record showing that various District officials requested Adsystech to
continue performance (and/or failed to direct Adsystech to stop performance), the record also
shows that contracting officer Peck, contracting officer Witty, Lewis, and the DCRA Director
promised Adsystech payment for work undertaken after contract funds were exhausted. For
example, the Adsytech CEO testified that Peck stated that she would request that Witty resolve
the funding issue. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 98:18-102:4. Although uncertain of the date that Peck made
the above representation, Adsystech’s CEO testified that he believed it was before the April 2001
stop work order was issued.15 Id. The record also indicates that Witty informed Adsystech in an
October 2000 email that “I am working on your back payment issues and expect the process to
take to [m]id November to find and obligate the funds. Payment is likely to be made no sooner
than January even if I pushed hard.” Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 14.

         Adsystech’s project manager also testified that he was in attendance at meetings with
Lewis where she assured Adsystech of payment. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 260:1-18; 263:3-8. The
District’s witnesses did not contradict this statement. Rather, the Interim DCRA Director
testified that she attended a March 2, 2000, meeting with Adsystech, Lewis and others. When
asked whether “anyone, yourself or Theresa Lewis, or anyone else” [at the meeting] promised to
secure additional money for Adsystech, the Interim Director testified only that “I know I
didn’t[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 593:15-597:10. Her testimony was silent as to any payment
representations that Lewis may have made.

       Further, the DCRA Director met with Adsystech representatives in or around July 2000.
In a September 13, 2000, follow up letter, the Director wrote:

         “[b]y this letter, I am authorizing payment once we receive and accepted [sic]
         these deliverables, and have been provided with a demonstration [of] the system
         designed for the Office of Adjudication, as well as any additional deliverables
         discussed during [our]meeting.”

         Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 7; Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 161:14-163:14.

        In addition to the inadequacy of the KPMG study, there were two other factors leading to
Adsystech’s performance of additional contract work herein: problems with final data
conversion, and the development of DCRA’s Master Business License (MBL) permit, and
problems encountered with final data conversion. As regards the MBL development,
Adsystech’s scope enlarged significantly during the contract due to Theresa Lewis’ request that
it develop a MBL as part of the upgrade. A MBL is a license that replaces a merchant’s
obligation to apply separately for multiple licenses, with a simplified process whereby a single
14
   The former official testified, however, that her understanding was that Adsystech was “finishing up the contract”
and not doing any “new work.” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 612:1-614:3. We do not see the significance in the distinction for
purposes of determining whether District contract officials authorized (directly or through ratification) Adsystech to
continue performance after contract funds had been exhausted. Neither party contends herein that work performed
by Adsystech after exhaustion of contract funds was for “new work” unrelated to the parties’ June 18 and October
25 contracts.
15
   The stop work order issued herein is discussed infra at pp. 7-8.
                                                       -7-                    Adsystech, Inc., CAB No. D-1210



license is issued authorizing all of a merchant’s regulated activity. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 266:10-
267:18. The MBL was not originally a part of the parties’ contract scope. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 209:15-
210:18; 236:17-238:9. Their original scope called for separately-issued multiple business
licenses. Id. But Theresa Lewis learned about the MBL concept during a visit to Washington
state, and “thought it could work in the District[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 664:16-665:21. There was no
written guidance to Adsystech, however, as to development of the MBL because the KPMG
study did not address it, and much of the concept was “in [Lewis’] head.” Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 234:4-
238:9; 309:21-310:21.

        Lewis assigned a key person to provide Adsystech with DCRA’s business logic, and in
reliance thereon, Adsystech spent “numerous hours and weeks” developing a MBL that met with
the assigned staffer’s approval. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 249:5-21. When presented with Adsystech’s
initial MBL, however, Lewis rejected it stating that her staff had provided Adsystech with the
wrong requirements. Id. 249:5-250:4. As a result, Adsystech informed Lewis that the changes
would require additional work, and add to the cost. Id. 250:18-22. Ultimately, Adsystech put in
the additional work to create an acceptable MBL which was used by Lewis in a demonstration
for businesses of how the new licensing process would work. See Appellant’s Supp. Ex. 38; see
also Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 270:7-272:19; vol. 2, 384:10-385:8.

        With respect to final data conversion, Adsystech performed additional work because of
DCRA’s inability to provide the final data required for conversion. Adsystech testified that data
conversion consisted largely of three steps: (1) selection of data to migrate, (2) Adsystech’s
development of the “tool” to take data from the old system to the Hansen system, and (3) the
user-community’s clean-up of the migrated data afterward. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 365:12- 368:14.
Adsystech testified that DCRA staff failed to and/or were untimely delivering data from its
various databases to Adsystech for ultimate conversion to the Hansen system. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1,
244:11-21. As a result, Adsystech testified that it ended up “putting development staff on there
to actually get certain information that they were supposed to provide themselves, the [DCRA]
IT staff[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 368:16-369:5. Consequently, Adsystech testified that it performed
more work on data conversion than intended under the parties’ contract. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 368:15-
369:16.

        In total, Adsystech continued to perform services and bill therefore for 13 months
following the point at which the parties were aware that contract funds were exhausted. During
the 13 month period in question, Adsystech submitted 9 invoices to the appellee totaling
$713,305. Adsystech’s invoices were submitted at the approximate rate of one per month.16

        The District issued a Stop Work Order (SWO) on April 3, 2001. Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 11.
The SWO was issued by contracting officer Witty who testified that he issued the order because
he “was told by [DCRA’s IT official], the day before, that he would like to have the stop
order[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 509:15-510:4. Witty testified that he didn’t think the DCRA IT person
gave a reason. Id. 510:7-11. Witty went on to testify that his personal belief was that the order
came about because a newly-hired OCTO consultant17 wanted Adsystech’s contract stopped

16
   Appellant submitted one invoice on June 2, 2000, covering the four month period February 1, 2000, to May 31,
2000. Thereafter appellant submitted one invoice per month until April 12, 2001. Hr’g Supp. Ex. 36a.
17
   The newly-hired official was “Kim Henderson.” Witty testified that “if [he] had to guess”, Kim Henderson joined
                                                          -8-                       Adsystech, Inc., CAB No. D-1210



because of a funding shortage, and Adsystech’s purported use of “triggers” instead of the Hansen
system.18 Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 510:12-516:3.

        The District’s stated reason for issuing the SWO, however, was very different. An email
sent by Witty to the Adsystech CEO approximately one month after the District issued the SWO,
indicates that it was issued due to allegations that the District did not receive services they paid
for and, therefore, was conducting “a routine review of all deliverables under the contract[.]”19
The email also noted that the SWO would be released “[i]f the review finds nothing.”
Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 13.

         At the time that the SWO was issued, Adsystech testified that the Hansen system had not
gone “live” in any of the DCRA administrations,20 but that Adsystech had completed its
contractual performance and was awaiting DCRA’s clean up of data redundancies so that
Adsystech could do a final data conversion and go live. See Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 266:4-266:9; Hr’g
Tr. vol. 2, 351:16-353:2; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 354:3-21; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 369:17-370:18; Hr’g Tr. vol.
2, 383:7-22; 389:4-8; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 391:20-392:7.21

        Evidence adduced at the hearing regarding the status of Adsystech’s contract completion
at the time of the SWO included (1) very detailed testimony by Adsystech’s project manager
regarding its contract performance, and (2) three contemporaneous written documents prepared
between January 3, 2001, and April 6, 2001 (two prepared by Adsystech and the third by a
District consultant). We briefly summarize the evidence below.

        Adsystech’s project manager provided very detailed testimony during which he
concluded that each of the 10 tasks outlined in the parties’ agreed upon statement of work was
completed. He also testified that the District did not reject any Adsystech deliverables required
by the contract. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 353:21-354:2. His testimony was not contradicted by the
District’s two witnesses, neither of whom appeared to be familiar with the technical nature of the
contract’s performance requirements, nor engaged in contract oversight or administration.22

       The Adsystech project manager’s testimony regarding its completion of each contract
task can be summarized as follows:


OCTO in January 2001 (or later) and that the DCRA contract was one of his projects. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 513:1-515:19.
18
   Triggers are programming code that directs the system to automatically take data entered on one screen, and store
or enter it elsewhere in the system. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 297:4-17.
19
   Mr. Witty also stated that, “[t]here are allegations that [the District has] not received all of the deliverables under
the contract.” Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 13.
20
   He testified that the MBL was “on the verge of going live” and was so close to going “live” that Ms. Lewis “had a
public showing with businesses…[on] how it was going to change and … benefit” them, and that “[Adsystech had]
already loaded it in the production one stop environment for them to showcase it[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 384:10-385:8.
He also testified that some processes in BRA were live, and that Hansen was “at some level of operation” at BLRA.
Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 384:10-390:4.
21
   Adsystech’s project manager also testified that it had not completed integration of the Hansen system into the
District’s larger citywide Call Center program at the time of the SWO. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 370:19-372:15. We discuss
this issue under “Task 9” infra at p. 10.
22
   Witty did not appear to understand the technical nature of the services provided under the contract. See, e.g., Hr’g
Tr. vol. 2, 513:20-514:21. Similarly, Fuller’s lack of technical depth is noted herein at pp. 12-13.

                  TASK 1 is identified as “Project Kick-off,” which is defined as a meeting
           between Adsystech and DCRA management and other key staff. Appellee’s
           Hr’g Ex. 3, p.2. The project manager testified that the meeting was held in July
           1999. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 313:12-17.

                  TASK 2 is identified as “Project Implementation Plan,” which
           Adsystech’s project manager testified was delivered to DCRA on or before
           December 9, 1999. Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3, p.2. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 322:7-323:1.
           Additionally, contracting officer Peck corroborated Adsystech’s completion of the
           plan in her October 25, 1999, “Council Contract Summary,” transmitting the
           October 25 contract to the Council of the District of Columbia for review.
           Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 5.

                    TASK 3 is identified as “Implementation Priorities” for the Hansen
           upgrade, which the project manager testified was completed when Adsystech
           submitted the project plan to DCRA (i.e., on or before December 9, 1999).
           Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3, p.2. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 327:7-8; 331:10-22. The project
           manager testified that BLRA/Group 1 was prioritized. Id. 327:7-329:3. He
           testified further that this task involved identification of over 300 new tables that
           Adsystech needed to build in furtherance of the upgrade. 23 Id. 329:4-330:9.

                   TASK 4 is identified as “Software and Training,” which included software
           licenses, a maintenance contract for 150 concurrent users, installation rights, a
           training plan, training, and a user acceptance test. Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3, p.3. The
           project manager testified that the training plan and training deliverable were
           provided. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 346:5-7; 347:3-348:15. He also testified that the
           required software, licenses and maintenance plan were acquired per the statement
           of work. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 319:4-320:18. Finally, he testified that all of the user
           tests were completed. Id. 372:16-373:22.

                   TASK 5 is identified as “Develop System Implementation Specifications,”
           which the project manager testified meant creation of the tables, databases,
           screens, work flow processes, and reports (i.e., permits) printed out by the
           system. Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3, p.4; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 348:16-349:16. More
           specifically, the project manager testified that its deliverable was to provide a
           template by which DCRA could print the various licenses, permits, vouchers, etc.
           that it issued. Id. 349:17-352:14. The project manager testified that Adsystech
           delivered templates for all of the required processes. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 352:16-
           353:2.

                  TASK 6 is identified as “Review and Validate Process Flows,” which the
           record indicated was not an Adsytech task, but rather a DCRA one. Appellee’s
           Hr’g Ex. 3, p.4 (“DCRA will deliver documentation and process flows of “as is”
           processes to the Contractor…”); see also Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 355:4-17. The project

       manager testified that the KPMG study was a part of this task, but that certain
       “content,” “fields” and “business logic” information had to be gotten from the
       [DCRA] focus group members[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 355:22-356:14. The project
       manager testified that DCRA failed to complete Task 6 in an efficient manner. Id.
       356:15-19.

               TASK 7 is identified as “Implementation Processes,” which the record
       indicates, and the Adsystech project manager testified, meant selecting the 11
       core processes that were to be implemented under the June 18 contract.
       Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3, p.5; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 356:20-358:10.

               TASK 8 is identified as “Data Conversion,” which the record indicates
       and the project manager testified, meant delivery of a data conversion standards
       document to DCRA, Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3, p.5, Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 363:17-364:5,
       analysis of existing raw data for the purposes of determining whether DCRA
       wanted to migrate it to the new system, id. 366:2-10, writing “the tool” to migrate
       data from the old to the new system, id. 366:21-367:9, and data clean-up (removal
       of duplicates, identification of missing information, etc.). Id. 366:11-20. The
       project manager testified that Adsystech provided the conversion document to
       DCRA, id. 363:17-364:5, and completed the data conversion, except for master
       license duplicates as to which DCRA was responsible. Id. 367:10-368:14; 369:17-
       370:18. The project manager went on to testify that Adsystech performed more
       work under Task 8 than contemplated under the original contract. Id. 368:15-
       369:10. He testified that this work included the assignment of Adsystech
       “development staff” to work on “get[ting] certain information that they [DCRA]
       were supposed to provide themselves[.]” Id.

               TASK 9 is identified as “System Interfaces and Integration,” which the
       record indicates and the Adsystech project manager testified, meant building
       interfaces between the Hansen system and other District systems, including, but
       not limited to, the citywide Call Center and the Rapid System (a remote device for
       inspector data-entry). Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3, p.6; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 370:19-371:18.
       The project manager testified that Adsystech did not complete the Call Center
       interface, and that he did not remember if it completed the Rapid System one. Id.
       371:19-372:15. He testified that a meeting with Theresa Lewis to discuss the
       interface did not result in any decisions, and that the interface task remained
       unresolved at the time of the SWO. Id. 371:19-372:15.

               TASK 10 is identified as “Customized Training Guide.” Appellee’s Hr’g
       Ex. 3, p.6. Adsystech did not provide testimony indicating whether it completed
       this task, nor did it submit a copy of the guide as an exhibit into our record.

        In addition to the project manager’s testimony regarding task completion, the record
includes an email sent by Adsystech’s project manager to a District official on January 10, 2001,
that references an attached Adsystech report addressing the creation of an interface between the
                                                        -11-                     Adsystech, Inc., CAB No. D-1210



Hansen system and a web portal under consideration.24 Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 49. During this
period, DCRA realized that it could not manually process all of the expected master business
license renewals, and sought to work with Adsystech to “create a self-help web interface portal
where people could go online …and they could then self-create their…license and pay for it[.]”
Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 272:20-274:5. The significance of the attachment is that it purports to
summarize work already completed by Adsystech as of January 3, 2001 (the date on the
report).25

        Adsystech’s project manager testified that the report documented the methodology by
which Adsystech completed the Hansen implementation, provided a description of the completed
system, and listed an inventory matrix itemizing the “sheer volume of work that [Adsystech] had
to do to implement the full solution that was currently in use within DCRA[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 1,
284:17-299:14. The document itself portrays the Hansen implementation as having been
completed, and includes a narrative that summarizes numerous components of the completed
system (e.g., an Oracle Enterprise Server 8.0.3 relational database, over 1,400 tables (including
400 custom tables to support DCRA’s unique business processes), over 300 triggers and stored
procedures, and, functions to organize/schedule inspections and calculate fees based on
application type). Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 49. In short, Exhibit 49 portrays Adsystech’s
performance as being complete or nearly complete as of January 3, 2001.26

          Further, a second Adsystech contemporaneous document, dated February 8, 2001, also
shows that Adsystech’s performance was complete or substantially complete as of its date.
Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 31. The document is a de facto punch list, and appellant's project manager
testified that he and Theresa Lewis agreed that the schedule of items in the document reflected
their final list of contract items requiring completion. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 379:2-380:22. The project
manager also testified that DCRA was presented with the document one month before it issued
the SWO. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 268:5-269:1. The document lists three categories of remaining work
items as of February 8, 2001. Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 31. The Adsystech project manager
provided the following testimony regarding Adsystech’s eventual completion of these items:

                  Master License Deployment Schedule: The project manager
                  testified that it completed most tasks required for the final data
                  conversion of the Master Business License, including “providing
                  the document, providing the mapping, actually writing the code
                  that had to do the actual conversion process[,]” but never received
24
   Adsystech was asked by OCTO Deputy Director Jack Pond to become involved in connecting the Hansen system
to the DCRA website and, by January 2001, Adsystech was “heavily engaged” in the project. Id. According to
Adsystech’s project manager, the project eventually “subsided” and “everything stopped.” Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 290:1-
17.
25
   The report is titled, “Technical Overview For Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs eBusiness Center
Interface to the DCRA Permits and Licensing Hansen Enterprise Solution[.]” Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 49.
26
   The District did not challenge the accuracy of the report on cross-examination. Additionally, its witnesses did not
challenge the accuracy of the Adsystech report in the District’s case-in-chief. Finally, the District’s post-hearing
brief does not specifically challenge the accuracy of the report. At the hearing, however, the District objected to
introduction of Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 49 because it was not produced during discovery. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 278:17-
280:22. The Presiding Judge agreed to allow questioning on Ex. 49, but ruled that the decision on its admissibility
would be determined later. Id. The record is unclear as to whether the Presiding Judge eventually allowed Ex. 49
into evidence.

DCRA’s final version of the data needed to go into final
production. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 381:1-383:15. The project manager
testified that if the DCRA data had been delivered timely,
Adsystech could have gone into final production on March 6,
2001. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 383:16-384:9. Nonetheless, the project
manager testified that Adsystech provided DCRA with a system
that produced master licenses. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 270:7-272:19. The
appellant also provided an example of a completed MBL for our
record. Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 38a.

OAD Deployment Schedule: The project manager testified that
“there were no issues with closing out OAD. It was minor
things[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 387:2-389:3. As a whole, the project
manager appeared to have very little recollection as to whether it
completed OAD’s Hansen implementation punch list. Id.

6 Remaining Adsystech Work Items: The project manager testified
that one outstanding item was creation of a “flag” notifying the
Office of Tax and Revenue of certain tax information before
issuance of a license. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 390:5-22. The project
manager testified that it was completed. Id. 391:5-13. A second
outstanding item pertained to corporations, which the project
manager also testified was done. Id. 391:14-19. A third outstanding
item was described as matching addresses in DCRA’s legacy
database to business licenses in the Hansen system. Id. 391:20-
393:19. The project manager testified that the conversion of the
legacy database addresses to Hansen never occurred because
DCRA was “not capable of doing” it. Id. A fourth outstanding item
was Adsystech’s receipt of final DCRA feedback on the MBL
templates that appellant developed. Id. 394:13-396:16. The
project manager testified that it received final feedback from
Theresa Lewis on MBL templates. Id. 395:12-396:16. A fifth
remaining work item entailed revisions Adsystech was supposed to
make to DCRA’s renewal bill report. Id. 396:17-398:5. However,
the project manager testified that DCRA needed to provide
Adsystech with data, and then Adsystech would make the final
revisions. Id. The project manager testified that he could not
remember if the fifth item was finalized. Id. A sixth remaining
Adsystech work item was data clean-up. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 268:5-
270:6. The project manager testified that data conversion was
complete by this time (i.e., February 8, 2001) because data clean
up would only occur after conversion. Id. He also testified that
DCRA was given two weeks to review data in the Hansen system,
and then tell Adsystech “what to clean up.” Id. Adsystech helped
DCRA identify problems by providing them with “statistics[,]”
“the types of problems[,]” and the “total numbers” of problems.
                                                        -13-                    Adsystech, Inc., CAB No. D-1210



                 Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 398:6-400:13.

        At the hearing, the District attempted to use the former DCRA Interim Director as a
witness to dispute Adsystech’s evidence regarding contract completion. In this regard, the
District sought to have the Interim Director validate statements made in an independent
consultant’s two written reports that were critical of Adsystech’s performance. Neither the author
of the reports, nor the District officials to whom they were submitted, testified at the hearing.27
The Interim Director, however, did not appear to have sufficient personal knowledge of
Adsystech’s performance, nor the technical mastery of the reports’ subject matter to discredit
Adsystech’s performance.

        Specifically, the Interim Director testified that “at some point” there were user
complaints about the Adsystech system “not doing what they thought … it should do”, Hr’g Tr.
vol. 2, 626:20-629:17, and that DCRA then retained Hansen Information Technologies (the
consultant) to “find out does [Adsystech’s Hansen implementation] do what it is supposed to
do[.]” Id. This development led to the consultant’s issuance of two critical reports on
Adsystech’s implementation, and the consultant’s correction of the purported deficiencies. The
consultant was paid $73,020 to correct 81 purported deficiencies noted in its first report dated
April 6, 2001. Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 10; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 632:8-635:5.28 The consultant was paid
an additional $259,692 to correct 44 problems identified in a second report dated April 30, 2001.
Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 69; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 631:10-632:4; 648:1-18; Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 73.

        However, the Interim Director did not appear knowledgeable regarding the deficiencies
noted in the first or second report. For example, the Interim Director testified that she didn’t
know whether the consultant did any of the initial work (i.e., relating to the 81 identified first set
of problems) because, “I don’t have the technical knowledge to go through each of these to say
what was work and what was just an assessment[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 648:19-649:7. On cross-
examination the former Interim Director testified that she was not DCRA’s technical person, and
conceded that the services performed by the consultant pursuant to the second contract may have
been beyond the scope of Adsystech’s contract. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 653:6-654:16. Her latter
testimony appears consistent with that of Adsystech’s project manager, whose testimony noted
that the consultant’s criticism of Adsystech pertained to DCRA’s upgrade from Hansen Version
7.0 to Version 7.5, which exceeded Adsystech’s contractual obligation to implement Version 7.0.
Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 429:11-430:12. The parties’ June 18 statement of work specified an upgrade to
Hansen Version 7.0. Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3.

        In contrast to the former Interim Director’s testimony, the Adsystech project manager
provided an item-by-item response to the 81 purported deficiencies noted in the consultant’s first
report. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 375:10-431:13. The essence of the project manager’s testimony was that
the consultant’s noted deficiencies were either things Adsystech was not tasked to do (contract
“enhancements” requiring a modification, items not on the parties agreed-to punch list, etc.), or

minor issues like training. Id. Moreover, the Board notes that none of the 81 purported
deficiencies appear on the parties’ February 8, 2001, punch list. Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 31
(discussed infra at pp. 11-12). Finally, the Board notes that the consultant’s April 6 report
corroborates Adsystech’s contention that there were considerable data redundancy problems in
DCRA’s database. See, e.g., Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 425:13-18; 428:11-16 (noting that the consultant’s
report mentions the same data redundancies at items H.2, H.4, and H.12 that Adsystech
complained of in its communications with DCRA).

         The SWO was never released, nor did Adsystech ever receive a cure notice, termination
letter, or similar notification from the District. Hr’g Tr.vol. 1, 133:19-135:10. Adsystech’s
instant claim is for the $44,165 balance remaining on its June 18, 1999, contract, and the
$713,305 in nine unpaid invoices under its October 25, 1999, contract. Therefore, in all,
appellant seeks an equitable adjustment in the amount of $757,470 under the theory of
constructive change (implied ratification). Alternatively, the appellant seeks recovery under the
theories of promissory estoppel and quantum meruit.

        Conversely, the appellee contends that the Anti-Deficiency Act bars payment because
Adsystech’s billings exceed the contract ceiling price, and/or that the parties’ agreement to
continue services after funds exhaustion embodies an impermissible oral agreement. Appellee’s
Post Hr’g Br. 11-14. The appellee also denies that District contracting officials ratified
Adsystech’s provision of services, asserting that ratification is valid only when it follows the
“official ratification procedure” set forth in former D.C. Code § 2-301.05(d)(5) and the District’s
Procurement Policy and Procedure Directive No. 1800.00 (each discussed below). Id. 14-20.
Finally, the District contends that the Board lacks jurisdiction over quantum meruit claims, that
equitable estoppel does not apply because its agents were not authorized to enter a contract with
Adsystech, and that equitable adjustment cannot be invoked to authorize a payment that exceeds
a District purchase order. Id. 20-26.

                                                   DISCUSSION

        We exercise jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to D.C. Code §2-360.03(a)(2) (2011).29
The Board’s jurisdiction herein is not disputed by the appellee. Appellant submitted claims to
contracting officer “James Brady” pertaining to the above on December 9, 2002. AF Ex. 18. In a
letter dated December 20, 2002, Brady informed the appellant that “Bruce Witty is the correct
Contracting Officer[,]” and that the claim would be forwarded to Witty. Id. Our record does not
indicate when, or whether, Brady forwarded appellant’s claims to Witty. No decision was ever
forthcoming from Witty. As a result, the appellant filed its Notice of Appeal with the Board on
June 20, 2003, noting that its claim had been “pending, without decision…since late December
2002[.]” AF, Notice of Appeal, June 20, 2002. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the
Board’s jurisdictional prerequisites have been met in this case.

        The recitation of facts stated in the background, discussion, and conclusion sections
constitute the Board’s findings of fact in accord with D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 27, § 214.2 (2002).
Additionally, rulings on questions of law, and mixed questions of fact and law are set forth
throughout our decision.
29
     Prior to April 8, 2011, the Board exercised jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03(a)(2)(2001).

        There are four issues presented in this case. The first issue is whether the appellant is
entitled to an equitable adjustment under the theory of constructive changes. The second issue is
whether Adsystech performed its contractual obligations herein. The third issue is whether the
Anti-Deficiency Act bars appellant’s recovery. Finally, the fourth issue is whether appellee’s oral
requests that Adsystech continue performance on the instant contract after the depletion of
contract funds constitutes an impermissible oral contract.

        Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that Adsystech is entitled to an
equitable adjustment for constructive changes ordered and/or ratified by District contracting
officials. We also conclude that Adsystech completed its contractual obligation to implement
DCRA’s Hansen upgrade. Further, we conclude that the Anti-Deficiency Act does not apply
instantly, and thus is not a bar to appellant’s recovery. Finally, we conclude that former D.C.
Code §§ 2-301.05(d)(5) (ratification procedures) and 2-301.05(d)(3) (barring oral contracts) do
not apply instantly. We remand this matter to the appellee for a determination of quantum. The
parties shall notify the Board within 30 days of the status of negotiations. We address the merits
issues below.

     Appellant Is Entitled To An Equitable Adjustment Due To Constructive Changes

        An equitable adjustment is “simply [a] corrective measure utilized to keep a contractor
whole when the Government modifies a contract[.]” Appeal of Grunley Const., Inc., CAB No.
D-910, 41 D.C. Reg. 3622, 3638 (Sept. 14, 1993)(citing Construction Corporation v. United
States, 163 Ct. Cl. 97 (1963)). In order to establish eligibility for an adjustment based on a
constructive change, a contractor must demonstrate the occurrence of two events: a bona fide
“change” and the issuance of an “order.” D.C. v. Org. for Envtl. Growth , 700 A.2d 185, 203
(D.C. 1997) rev’d on other grounds sub nom, Abadie v. Org. for Envtl. Growth, 806 A.2d 1225
(D.C. 2002); Appeal of Technical Construction, Inc., CAB No. D-730, 36 D.C. Reg. 4067, 4085
(Mar. 14, 1989). A “change” is established when the actual performance goes beyond the
minimum standards required by the contract. Org. for Envtl. Growth at 203. An “order” can be
shown whenever a government representative, by words or deeds that go beyond mere advice,
comment, suggestion, or opinion, requires the contractor to perform work which is not a
necessary part of the contract. Id.

        In the instant case, Adsystech has established both the “change” and “order” elements
required to warrant an equitable adjustment. With respect to contract changes, the record shows
that Adsystech’s actual performance went beyond the contract’s minimum standards in four
ways. First, District contracting officials directed Adsystech to continue contract performance
beyond the point at which contract funds became depleted. This was done to secure Adsystech’s
performance in completing “to be” systems mapping, MBL development, and final data
conversion. Thus, contracting officers Peck and Witty directed Adsystech to finish the Hansen
upgrade. Peck directed Adsystech to continue performance through a direct request. Witty,
through his failure to stop Adsystech’s performance, also “directed” Adsystech to continue
performance. The evidence shows that Peck told Adsystech directly to stay on the job. Hr’g Tr.
vol. 2, 482:12-17; 482:22-483:1. The evidence also shows that Witty knew as early as “August,
September of 2000” that lapsed contract funds were an issue and that Adsystech was “definitely”
                                               -16-                Adsystech, Inc., CAB No. D-1210



still performing, yet he did not order them to stop performance. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 531:3-18; 527:9-
528:4.

        Second, Adsystech performed additional contract work prompted by the inadequacy of
KPMG’s study of DCRA’s “to be” processes. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 355:4-356:19. In this regard,
TASK 6 of the contract required DCRA to “deliver documentation and process flows of as is
processes” to Adsystech. Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3, 4; see also Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 355:4-17. As we
noted, deficiencies in the KPMG study caused Adsystech to work directly with designated
DCRA staff to “extract and develop” system requirements through incremental mapping. Hr’g
Tr. vol. 1, 65:5-67:4; 240:20-242:22. This was a lengthy and tedious process, with dysfunctional
meetings and reluctant DCRA stakeholders. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 243:1-244:21; Hr’g Tr. vol. 1,
243:1-244:21. Moreover, this incremental approach to mapping DCRA’s system requirements
resulted in additional work, as well as changes to contract cost and scheduling. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1,
67:14-71:1.

        Third, Adsystech performed additional work prompted by DCRA’s request for
development of a MBL, and the multiple and differing requirements communicated to Adsystech
regarding MBL development. In this regard, we noted that the MBL was not originally part of
the parties’ contract scope. Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3, p.4; Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 209:15-210:18; 236:17-
238:9. The MBL concept “started out in Lewis’ head,” and was developed largely from scratch
because the KPMG study was not useful guidance for developing MBL requirements. Hr’g Tr.
vol. 1, 234:4-238:9; 309:21-310:21. Although TASK 5 of the parties’ contract called for the
development of licenses, termed “reports” in the statement of work, there is no mention of a
MBL, nor of a “report” with the functionality of the MBL. Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3, p.4; Hr’g Tr.
vol. 2, 348:16-349:16. That notwithstanding, Adsystech eventually spent “numerous hours and
weeks” developing a MBL according to requirements provided by DCRA staff, Hr’g Tr. vol. 1,
249:5-21, only to have Lewis reject its work because she disagreed with how DCRA staff
identified MBL requirements. Id. 249:5-250:4. This led to even more MBL development work
and the additional costs associated therewith. Id. 250:18-22.

        Finally, Adsystech performed additional work helping DCRA complete internal data
conversion. In this regard, TASK 8 of the parties’ contract required, inter alia, Adsystech to
deliver a Data Conversion Standards Document to DCRA, Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3, 5; Hr’g Tr.
vol. 2, 363:17-364:5, analyze raw data with DCRA for the purpose of allowing DCRA to
determine the data to be migrated to the new system, id. 366:2-10, and perform data clean-up
(removal of duplicates, identification of missing information, etc.). Id. 366:11-20. While
Adsystech provided the conversion document to DCRA, id. 363:17-364:5, DCRA failed to
complete data clean-up for the MBL. Id. 367:10-368:14; 369:17-370:18. DCRA staff also failed
and/or were untimely delivering data from its various databases to Adsystech for ultimate
conversion to the Hansen system. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 244:11-21. This required Adsystech to assume
more work under Task 8 than was contemplated under the original contract. Id. 368:15-369:10.
This additional work included the assignment of Adsystech “development staff” to work on
“get[ting] certain information that they [DCRA] were supposed to provide themselves[.]” Id. It
also included Adsystech’s development of “routines” to assist DCRA with identifying bad and
duplicative data. See Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 367:10-368:14.
                                                        -17-                    Adsystech, Inc., CAB No. D-1210



       With respect to the “order” element required for an equitable pricing adjustment, the
record shows that District contracting officials Peck and Witty directed Adsystech to “stay on the
job” to complete DCRA’s upgrade. The officials’ request that Adsystech remain on the job
necessarily implied that Adsystech was directed by them to “finish” incomplete tasks, i.e., “to
be” systems mapping, MBL development, and final data conversion. Thus, we conclude that
authorized District officials ordered Adsystech to “stay on the job” to finish DCRA’s upgrade,
and directed them to perform the additional work under Tasks 5, 6 and 8 as noted above.

        The District’s manner of “ordering” these changes included contracting officer Peck’s
direct request that Adsystech stay on the job, contracting officer Witty’s conduct consistent with
a request that Adsystech continue performance, and Peck and Witty’s ratification of requests
made by DCRA’s former Director and Lewis (the COTR) that Adsystech continue performance.
As regards the contracting officer Peck’s direct request that Adsystech continue contract
performance after funds depletion, she told Adsystech to stay on the job. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 482:12-
17; 482:22-483:1. Peck was clearly mindful of the funding shortage when she directed Adsystech
to continue working. For example, Adsystech’s CEO testified that Peck stated that she would
request that Witty resolve the funding issue. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 98:18-102:4. This was corroborated
by Witty himself, who testified that in “August, September of 2000,” contracting officer Peck
asked him to “get involved in the [DCRA Hansen] contract to find out where it is going at the
time they were running without funds and I was to see what I could do to help out…” Hr’g Tr.
vol. 2, 491:16-492:8 (emphasis added).

       In addition to contracting officer Peck’s direct request, the conduct of contracting officer
Witty amounted to an implied order to Adsystech to remain on the job notwithstanding the
funding shortage. For example, Witty knew as early as “August, September of 2000” that lapsed
contract funds were an issue, and that Adsystech was “definitely” still performing. Hr’g Tr. vol.
2, 531:3-18. Nonetheless, by his own testimony, Witty took no action to stop Adsystech’s
performance because he did not want to “have my butt kicked because I stopped something that
was in process or ready to go[.]” Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 527:9-528:4.

        Witty even took matters a step further. An October 19, 2000, email that he sent to
Adsystech’s CEO states that, “I am working on your back payment issues and expect the process
to take to [m]id November to find and obligate the funds. Payment is likely to be made no sooner
than January even if I pushed hard.” Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 14. Adsystech’s CEO testified that it
was “more likely” than not that the October 2000 email referred to the instant contract, as well as
a separate Adsystech contract not at issue in this case. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 182:17-183:9.30 Even
though Witty never secured Adsystech’s payment, it appears that his email amounts to an
acknowledgement that the appellee was well aware of, and accepted responsibility for,
Adsystech’s continued performance.

      Finally, the evidence also showed that contracting officials Peck and Witty ratified the
conduct of DCRA agency representatives Theresa Lewis and the DCRA Director, both of whom

30
  Witty’s testimony that he did not learn about Adsystech’s funding problem on the instant contract until after the
stop work order is not convincing. See Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 579:3-580:11; see also Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 13. There are too
many instances in the record where Witty’s testimony plainly contradicts such an assertion. For example, Witty
testified that he knew about the funding problem in “August, September of 2000[.]” Hr’g Tr. Vol. 2, 491:16-492:8.

requested continuing performance by Adsystech and promised payment therefore. As we have
noted, ratification may be found where the ratifying government official has actual or
constructive knowledge of a representative’s unauthorized act and expressly or impliedly adopts
the act. Appeal of Chief Procurement Officer, CAB No. D-1182, 50 D.C. Reg. 7465, 7468-7469
(Nov. 29, 2002) (citing Appeal of W.M. Schlosser, CAB No. D-903, 42 D.C. Reg. 4824, (Sept.
13, 1994)). Moreover, a contracting official’s action to obtain funding for changes ordered by
unauthorized representatives constitutes ratification of the unauthorized changes. Id. at 7469
(citing Reliable Disposal Company, Inc. ASBCA 40100, 91-2 BCA ¶ 23,895 at 119,718). A
contracting officer’s silence and/or failure to stop contract performance may also constitute
ratification. Id. In this case, DCRA’s then Director and Lewis requested Adsystech to perform
additional work, to continue working beyond the funding lapse, and promised them payment
therefore. Peck and Witty ratified these agency representatives’ conduct.

        For example, Adsystech’s project manager attended meetings with Ms. Lewis where she
assured Adsystech of payment. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 260:1-18; 263:3-8. Ms. Lewis told Adsystech’s
business development director to stay on the job. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 482:12-17. Ms. Lewis never
informed Adsystech that it should stop work because the contract funds were exhausted. Hr’g Tr.
vol. 1, 265:9-20. Similarly, the DCRA Director promised Adsystech payment in the
aforementioned September 13, 2000, letter, stating, “By this letter, I am authorizing payment
once we receive and accepted [sic] these deliverables, and have been provided with a
demonstration [of] the system designed for the Office of Adjudication, as well as any additional
deliverables discussed during [our] meeting.” Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 7; Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 161:14-
163:14. Rather than reject the DCRA representatives’ conduct, contracting officers Peck and
Witty enabled it. As noted, Peck ratified the DCRA agency representatives’ conduct by directing
Adsystech to stay on the job, and promising Adsystech payment for its continued services. Hr’g
Tr. vol. 2, 482:12-17; 482:22-483:1; 491:16-492:8; Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 98:18-102:4. Similarly, Witty
ratified the DCRA agency representatives’ conduct because he was aware of the work progress
yet he did not order Adsystech to stop work at any point prior to his April 3, 2001, SWO. Hr’g
Tr. vol. 2, 527:9-528:4.

       Thus, we conclude that Adsystech has met the requirements for an equitable adjustment
due to constructive contract changes. Adsystech has shown that District contract officials
changed and/or ratified changes to the parties’ contract. Adsystech has also showed that the
changes were ordered by authorized District contracting officials.

        We reject the District’s erroneous argument that lawful ratification did not occur here.
The District asserts that ratification would only have been valid if contracting officers Peck and
Witty followed the “official ratification procedure” set forth in former D.C. Code §
2.301.05(d)(5) and the District’s Procurement Policy and Procedure Directive No. 1800.00.31
In pertinent part, §2-301.05(d)(5) provided:

            (5) The Chief Procurement Officer, or a designee, may authorize payment for
            supplies or services received without a valid written contract if:

            (A) Supplies or services have been provided to and accepted by the District
31
     These provisions were in effect at all times material to the instant dispute.

       government, or the District government otherwise has obtained or will obtain a
       benefit resulting from provision of supplies or services without a valid written
       contract;

       (B) An agency contracting officer determines that the price for the supplies or
       services provided without a valid written contract is fair and reasonable;

       (C) An agency contracting officer recommends payment for the supplies or
       services provided without a valid written contract;

       (D) The Chief Financial Officer, or a designee, certifies that appropriated funds
       are available; and

       (E) The request for authorization for payment for supplies or services received
       without a valid written contract is in accordance with any other procedures or
       limitations prescribed by the Chief Procurement Officer; and

       (F) (i) The amount for supplies or services provided to and accepted by the
       District government does not exceed $100,000; and (ii) If an agency exceeds the
       specified threshold, the Chief Procurement Officer shall forward the request, by
       act transmitted by the Mayor, to the Council for review and approval.

Former D.C. Code § 2-301.05(d)(5).

              In addition, the appellee argues that the Office of Contracting and Procurement
(OCP) issued a Procurement Policy & Procedure Directive for the ratification of unauthorized
commitments. AF Ex. 86, Procurement Policy and Procedure Directive No. 1800.00. The
appellee contends that the directive required that a request for the ratification of an unauthorized
commitment be approved by the District’s Chief Procurement Officer, Chief Financial Officer,
agency head, agency chief contracting officer, and the agency corporation counsel. AF Ex. 86.

        Appellee’s attempted application of §2-301.05(d)(5) and OCP’s internal administrative
issuance to the instant matter is erroneous because Peck and Witty, as Chief Technology Officer
and contracting chief within the Office of the Chief Technology Officer, respectively, were
exempt from the Procurement Practices Act (PPA) as to Year 2000 procurements during the
period in question. During the years 1998-1999, nearly all public and private-sector entities were
preparing for massive computer system upgrades to prevent disruption anticipated by the onset
of calendar year 2000. The Y2K problem, as the crisis came to be known, resulted from the
inability of most computers to recognize dates beyond the year 1999.

        In the District, computer systems supporting public safety, revenue collection, traffic
control, payroll, social welfare benefits, pensions and more were identified as requiring
emergency remediation to avoid Y2K service lapses/chaos. Reports issued by the General
Accounting Office (GAO) in October 1998 and February 1999 noted that District efforts to
become Y2K compliant were “significantly behind” and “far behind.” GAO, Year 2000

Systems, Oct. 2, 1998; GAO, Year 2000 Computing Crisis, The District Remains Behind
Schedule, Statement of Jack L. Brock, Director, Governmentwide and Defense Information
Systems, February 19, 1999.

        In response to the Y2K crisis, the District enacted the “Chief Technology Officer Year
2000 Remediation Procurement Authority Temporary Amendment Act of 1999.” D.C. Law 13-
17, 46 D.C. Reg. 6314 (July 17, 1999). The Act specifically added new subsection (m) to §320
of the PPA as follows:

       (m)(1) Nothing in this act shall affect the authority of the Office of the Chief
       Technology Officer to execute Year 2000 remediation contracts. For the purpose
       of the section, the term “Year 2000 remediation contracts” means procurement
       for the correction of computers, computer-operated systems, and equipment
       operated by embedded computer chips, to ensure the proper recognition and
       processing of dates on or after January 1, 2000.

       The new provision was added to the section of the PPA exempting a variety of District
agencies from PPA coverage. See former D.C. Code §1183.20 (1981).

       The instant October 25, 1999, Hansen upgrade contract was specifically noted as a Y2K
contract by the Chief Technology Officer in correspondence transmitting the contract to the
Council for review. Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 5; see also Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 80:19-83-16. The statement
of work for the Hansen upgrade also stated that “the system must be Year 2000 compliant[.]” See
Appellee’s Hr’g Ex. 3, General Requirements, 8. Thus, we conclude that §2-301.05(d)(5) was
not applicable to the DCRA Hansen upgrade contract discussed herein, and is not a bar to
appellant’s entitlement claim.

                        Adsystech Performed The Change Order Work

        The District’s post hearing brief does not appear to dispute that Adsystech delivered all
deliverables required by the contracts. Appellee’s Post Hr’g Br. 2-4, 6-10. The Board concludes
that the record shows by a preponderance of the evidence that Adsystech has completed its
performance of eight of the 10 tasks identified in the parties’ statement of work. Thus, Adsystech
has completed Tasks 1-8. See discussion infra at pp. 9-10. The record is inconclusive as to
whether Adsystech completed Tasks 9-10.

         As to the 10 tasks stated in the parties’ statement of work, Adsystech’s project manager
provided detailed testimony noting its completion of eight of the 10 required tasks, which we
have summarized infra at pp. 9-10. See also Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 375:10-396:16. The District’s
witnesses did not discredit Adsystech’s testimony regarding completion of tasks, and appeared to
lack knowledge regarding the technical nature of contract performance. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 513:20-
514:13 (Witty); Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 648:19-649:7; 653:6-654:16 (Fuller). Similarly, Adsystech’s
witness testified that it completed the six punch list items submitted to the District on February 8,
2001. The District’s witnesses have not discredited this testimony either. Adsystech’s testimony
that it finished tasks herein is corroborated by Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 49, which shows that as of
                                               -21-                  Adsystech, Inc., CAB No. D-1210



January 8, 2001, most, if not all, of the Hansen upgrade implementation tasks had been
completed. Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 49. There was also testimony that the MBL was used by Lewis
in a demonstration for businesses of how the new licensing process would work. Hr’g Tr. vol. 1,
270:7-272:19; vol. 2, 384:10-385:8, and the record included a sample of a completed MBL.
Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 38a.

        The District’s sole witness to testify regarding contract performance, former Interim
Director Fuller, testified that she thought Adsystech had completed the Hansen upgrade for most
of the Business Land Regulation Administration and the Housing Regulation Administration as
early as March 2000. Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 602:2-603:15. Fuller also testified that she was unsure of
how much work Adsystech had completed in the Office of Adjudication division as of March
2000. Id. 602:6-609:19. Taken as a whole, the appellant has met its burden regarding substantial
completion of tasks required to finalize DCRA’s Hansen implementation. Adsystech’s evidence
includes the detailed testimony of its project manager regarding each task, as well as the project
manager’s testimony regarding Adsystech’s completion of the punch list items remaining as of
February 8, 2001. See discussion infra at pp. 11-12. See also Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 31. We
conclude that Adsystech has met its burden regarding substantial completion of performance
herein.

                The Anti-Deficiency Act Does Not Bar Appellant’s Recovery

       The District argues that the Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. § 1341, bars recovery herein
because once the “depletion of the funds encumbered by the [October 25] Purchase Order”
occurred, there was no valid written agreement between the parties. Appellee’s Post Hr’g Br. 11-
12. In other words, the District contends that once contract funds were depleted, any agreement
between Adsytech and the District for further work would have been a contract for the “future
payment of money, in advance of or in excess of existing appropriations” and thus void ab initio.
Id.

        In support of its argument, the District contends that the purchase order became depleted
once Adsystech submitted bills totaling $1,175,086.47 against a contract ceiling of $476,317.
Appellee’s Post Hr’g Br. 11. The record shows that this “depletion” would have occurred (if at
all) on or around June 2, 2000, with Adsystech’s submission of Invoice No. 4 for $405,717.31.
See Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 35. If paid, the parties would have exceeded the $476,317 contract
price by $285,558.96. We do not agree with the District’s analysis. From an Anti Deficiency
standpoint, there were sufficient appropriations during FY2000 and FY2001 to support
Adsystech’s continuing contract performance as noted herein.

               The Anti-Deficiency Act provides in pertinent part:

               § 1341. Limitations on expending and obligating amounts
               (a)(1) An officer or employee of the United States government or
               the District of Columbia government may not—

               (A) make or authorize an expenditure or obligation exceeding an
               amount available in an appropriation or fund for the expenditure or
                                                          -22-                     Adsystech, Inc., CAB No. D-1210



                  obligation;

                  (B) involve either government in a contract or obligation for the
                  payment of money before an appropriation is made unless
                  authorized by law . . ..

31 U.S.C. § 1341(a)(1).

        In Appeal of Advantage Energy LLC, CAB No. D-1199 (Dec. 3, 2010),
http://app.cab.dc.gov/Worksite/download.asp?filepath=Opinion.PDF&minLevel=032, we noted
the well settled rule that “as long as Congress has appropriated sufficient legally unrestricted
funds to pay a contract at issue, the Government normally cannot back out of a promise to pay on
grounds of insufficient appropriations, even if the contract uses language such as "subject to the
availability of appropriations," and even if an agency's total lump-sum appropriation is
insufficient to pay all the contracts the agency has made[.]” Id. (citing Cherokee Nation v.
Leavitt, 543 U.S. 631, 637-38 (2005).

       The FY 2000 District of Columbia Appropriations Act authorized $190,335,000 as an
appropriation to the District “for the current fiscal year out of the general fund of the District of
Columbia” for agencies within the Economic Development and Regulation cluster.33 Public Law
No. 106-113, Nov. 29, 1999, 113 Stat. 1501, 1505-08. Apart from a restriction directing
$15,000,000 to District Business Improvement Districts, the remaining funds are unrestricted.34
Based on the federal appropriation, the District enacted its own FY2000 budget, which included
a lump sum appropriation of $3,597,000 in the DCRA contractual services line item.
Government of the District of Columbia, Proposed FY2001 Budget and Financial Plan, B-100.
Both figures noted above clearly exceed the $757,470 in outstanding invoices at issue here.

       Additionally, the FY2001 District of Columbia Appropriations Act authorized
$205,638,000 in appropriated funds within the Economic Development and Regulation cluster,
with no restrictions germane to the instant case. Public Law No. 106-553, December 26, 2000,
114 Stat. 2762. Based on the FY 2001 federal appropriation, the District enacted its own budget
which included a lump sum appropriation of $3,087,000 in the DCRA contractual services line
item. Government of the District of Columbia, Proposed FY2002 Budget and Financial Plan,
March 12, 2001, B-43. Similarly, it is clear that sufficient funds were appropriated to cover the
claimed Adsystech amount. Thus, the Board’s review of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 and
2001 leads us to conclude that the Anti-Deficiency Act does not bar Adsystech’s entitlement
claim herein.

                The Provisions of Former D.C. Code §2-301.05(d)(3) Do Not Apply

interim, we have cited to the Board’s website, which is an acceptable alternative citation.

   The Board takes judicial notice that DCRA is within the Economic Development Regulation cluster of agencies.
34
    As to appropriation restrictions, there are a number of general restrictions that have no relevance instantly. For
example, there are restrictions against the use of the appropriation for partisan political activity, or for publicity or
propaganda to support or defeat congressional legislation. Public Law No. 106-113, §§110, 112, Nov. 29, 1999, 113
Stat. 1501.

       Finally, the District argues that Adsystech’s recovery is barred by former D.C. Code
§2-301.05(d)(3). In pertinent part, the cited provision states as follows:

               (3) Except as authorized under paragraph (4) or (5) of this
               subsection, any vendor who, after April 12, 1997, enters into an
               oral agreement with a District employee to provide supplies        or
               services to the District government without a valid written contract
               shall not be paid. If the oral agreement was entered into by District
               employee at the direction of a supervisor, the supervisor shall be
               terminated. The Mayor shall submit a report to the Council at least
               4 times a year on the number of person cited or terminated under
               this paragraph.

Former D.C. Code §2-301.05(d)(3).

       We reject appellee’s argument regarding the above statutory provision for the same
reason that we rejected its argument regarding former §2-301.05(d)(5): the Chief Technology
Officer’s Year 2000 contracts were exempt from PPA coverage during this period.

                                        CONCLUSION

       For the reasons noted herein, the Board finds that Adsystech is entitled to an equitable
adjustment against the District. District contracting officers issued and/or ratified constructive
change orders directing Adsystech to continue contract performance after the depletion of funds
for the purpose of completing DCRA’s Hansen upgrade. Because we have concluded that
Adsystech is entitled to an equitable adjustment, we will not consider appellant’s quantum meruit
and equitable estoppel theories of recovery. The case is remanded to the appellee for a
determination of quantum. The parties are instructed to inform the Board regarding the status of
quantum discussions within 30 days.
