                                         Filing ID #51146070


        These consolidated appeals arise under a contract for the reconstruction of a six block
span of paved street-way, on F Street, in the northwest corridor of the District of Columbia. It is
undisputed by the parties that, after the initial contract award, the District subsequently modified
the terms of this contract to significantly alter the order in which the Appellant was required to
perform the sequence of the project’s construction activities under the contract’s original traffic
maintenance plan. However, the parties dispute the resulting delay impact to the project, and
associated quantum of damages incurred by the Appellant, arising from this change order. In
this regard, the present action initially arises from the Appellant’s appeal of the contracting
officer’s decision to only grant a 90 day time extension and $204,000.00 in additional
compensation to the Appellant in connection with the subject change order issued by the District
that modified the sequence of the project construction activities. The Appellant also appeals
from the deemed denial of its claims seeking unabsorbed overhead incurred under its extended
contract performance in connection with this same contract change.

        We sustain the appeal, in part, and find the Appellant entitled to a time extension of 166
days arising from the subject District-ordered change, as well as related damages from the
District associated with the Appellant’s increased labor, equipment, and overhead costs arising
from the same change order. The District shall compensate the Appellant for these cost items in
accordance with the damage amounts awarded by the Board herein.

                                     FINDINGS OF FACT

1.      On March 1, 2005, the District Department of Transportation (“DDOT”) entered into
Contract No. POKA-2004-B-0018-JJ with Civil Construction, LLC (“Civil” or “Appellant”) for
the reconstruction of F Street, N.W., between 17th and 23rd streets (the “F Street Project”) in the
amount of $4,592,285.72. (Appeal File (“AF”) Ex. B.2.) Contract performance was to be
completed within one year. (See Hr’g Tr. 97:3, 324:19, 881:19.)
                                                                                         Civil Construction, LLC
                                                                            CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

2.       F Street is a two-lane roadway for eastbound only traffic and is bordered by residential,
commercial, educational, and governmental buildings. (Stipulated Fact (“SF”) 2.) The F Street
Project entailed a full reconstruction effort that included upgrading all of the underground
utilities, reconstruction of the street curb and lighting, as well as replacing the landscaping and
signage. (Hr’g Tr. 881:7.) The reconstruction effort involved replacement of underground
utilities—including water lines, storm drains, and electrical duct banks—along the six city blocks
on F Street between 17th and 23rd Streets. (Hr’g Tr. 176:7-178:1.) Additionally, the F Street
Project involved reconstruction of the sidewalk, gutter, and roadway structures. (Id.)

3.      Under the Contract’s Maintenance of Traffic specifications, contract drawings 56-61,
Civil was directed by the contract terms to restrict access to one lane of traffic at a time. (See
Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 39.) In particular, the Maintenance of Traffic specifications divided the F
Street Project into two phases, with construction work to be completed along the south side of F
Street in the first phase followed by the north side in the second phase. (Id.)

4.      Consistent with the Contract’s Maintenance of Traffic specifications, Civil’s baseline
schedule1 included a plan to complete the project in four phases: (1) complete the underground
utility work along the north side of F Street; (2) complete the underground utility work along the
south side of F Street; (3) perform street-level maintenance along the south-side lane; and (4)
complete street-level maintenance on the north-side lane. (SF 4; Appellant’s Expert Report2 Ex.
2.) Civil planned to perform work along the north side of F Street first, rather than the south
side, in order to accommodate the work required in replacing the water lines. (Hr’g Tr. 107:8-
110:20, 173:4-174:3.) This change, however, was a small variance to the contract specifications
and did not affect the overall cost or completion date of the contract. (Hr’g Tr. 107:21.)

5.     The Appellant further divided each phase of the contract into a sequence of smaller jobs;
each to be performed by a different utilities or construction crew. (Hr’g Tr. 176:18-179:22.)
The Appellant sequenced the F Street Project so that the first crew would begin work on one city
block and consecutively move on to the next block, while another crew would follow suit. (Hr’g
Tr. 178:16-180:7.) The crew working on the water line would begin work first, followed by the
crew working on the storm drains, and then the electrical crew. (Hr’g Tr. 176:18-179:1.) These
crews would be followed by crews working on the sidewalk and curb, the crew excavating the
roadway, and lastly the crew doing the asphalt work. (Hr’g Tr. 177:15-179:8.)

6.      Under the Appellant’s baseline schedule, Civil planned to have multiple crews working
simultaneously throughout the entire six blocks of the F Street Project, from 23rd Street to 17th
Street as each entire side (north and south) of these streets were, respectively, restricted from
traffic access. (Hr’g Tr. 86:13-87:4, 180:3-182:21.) This approach was consistent with, and
anticipated by, the Maintenance of Traffic specifications.3 (See Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 39.)




1
  Appellant submitted its initial baseline schedule to the District for approval on May 9, 2005. (SF 3.)
2
  Appellant’s Expert Report was entered into evidence as Appellant’s Hearing Exhibit 41.
3
  This interpretation of the F Street Project specifications was confirmed through the testimony of Civil’s employees
(Hr’g Tr. 70:12-20, 86:1-87:21, 169:8-171:5); an employee of Fort Myer Construction (which had been a competing
bidder for the contract) (Hr’g Tr. 682:3-18); and the Contracting Officer (Hr’g Tr. 881:6-882:19).

                                                        -2-
                                                                                    Civil Construction, LLC
                                                                       CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

7.     The District issued a Notice to Proceed on April 25, 2005, authorizing the Appellant to
begin work on May 9, 2005, and establishing an original contract completion date of May 8,
2006. (SF 5, 7.)

8.      On May 7, 2005, Civil placed 2,172 linear feet of concrete barrier along F Street in
anticipation of contract performance. (SF 6; see also Hr’g Tr. 185:1-7.)

Change Order

9.      Immediately after Civil placed the concrete barrier, the neighboring community began
objecting to the anticipated disruption the planned construction would cause. (Hr’g Tr. 89:10-22,
185:12-186:4, 882:9.) The District verbally instructed Civil to remove most of the concrete
barrier that it had erected and only perform the contracted work in two-block increments so that
more of F Street would be accessible to traffic as the contract work progressed. (Hr’g Tr. 89:18-
22, 186:8-14.) Moreover, on May 19, 2005, less than two weeks after Civil began its contract
performance, the Contracting Officer (“CO”) issued a written letter, pursuant to Article 3 of the
Standard Contract Provisions, limiting the phasing of the F Street Project to only permit the
construction work to be performed two blocks at a time for the remaining duration of contract
performance (hereinafter “Change Order”). (AF Ex. B.3.) In his letter, the CO specifically
referenced the Maintenance of Traffic drawings that were incorporated into the contract terms.
(Id.)

10.    By a letter dated May 24, 2005, the Appellant acknowledged receipt of the CO’s May 19,
2005, Change Order. (AF Ex. C.5.) In its acknowledgement letter, the Appellant stated that the
two-block restriction would materially change the nature of the project and thus drastically
increase the duration and associated costs. (Id.) Accordingly, the Appellant requested that a
formal change order be negotiated to reflect the increased duration and costs arising from this
change mandate. (Id.)

11.     The new two-block construction restriction in the Change Order limited the work space
available to the Appellant’s various crews, which in turn reduced productivity as crews had to
perform smaller tedious tasks continuously throughout the project instead of consecutively
progressing Civil’s work through the entire length of F Street (17th to 23rd streets) as originally
planned. (Hr’g Tr. 110:12-112:19, 270:1-272:2.) Productivity was also reduced as crews were
required to start and stop work along the length of the project in two-block increments, which
resulted in additional mobilizations and demobilizations by the Appellant beyond what was
anticipated by the baseline schedule. (Hr’g Tr. 190:1-191:3.) These added inefficiencies
consequently increased the costs associated with performance. (Hr’g Tr. 240:2-20, 268:1-
272:19.)

12.      The Appellant submitted a “good faith estimate” of the anticipated cost impact of the
two-block restriction on July 15, 2005, along with a revised schedule on July 21, 2005.
(Appellant’s Hr’g Exs. 4, 5.)4 In this submission, Civil initially estimated that the two-block
restriction would extend the original date of contract completion by 18 months, and thus would
result in the contract not being completed until December 24, 2007. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 4 at
4
  Appellant’s Hearing Exhibits 4 and 5 are also included in the record as Appeal File Exhibits C.6-1 and C.7,
respectively.

                                                                                        Civil Construction, LLC
                                                                           CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

35; Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 5 at 119.) The Appellant reiterated its May 24, 2005, request that a
formal change order be negotiated to reflect the impact of the two-block restriction that had been
imposed by the District. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 4 at 35.)

13.     Furthermore, the Appellant estimated that its contract costs would increase by an
additional $2,375,275.18 due to extra costs it would incur in connection with the newly-added
two-block construction restriction. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 4 at 40.) The estimate included
anticipated increased costs for labor, equipment, materials, field supervision, safety, additional
work, and other associated costs. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 4 at 40-58, 71-75.) Additionally, the
estimate included additional subcontractor costs, including Civil’s electrical subcontractor,
Central Armature Works, Inc. (“Central Armature”), and an unidentified asphalt subcontractor.
(Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 4 at 59-62, 68.) The Appellant’s estimate, however, specifically did not
include extended home office costs. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 4 at 35.) In support of its estimate,
the Appellant also included a detailed breakdown of its costs as originally bid. (Appellant’s Hr’g
Ex. 4 at 76-114.)

14.    By a letter of August 10, 2005, Civil received a letter from a consultant for the District,
Terence Wright, informing Civil that its July 21, 2005, schedule had been rejected, in part
because the schedule did not reflect the current as-built status of the F Street Project. (AF Ex.
C.9.)

15.      Subsequently, on August 12, 2005, almost three months after the Change Order was
issued, Civil entered into a subcontract with Fort Myer Construction Corporation (“Fort Myer”)
to perform the required asphalt work on the F Street Project. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 31.) The
subcontract contained unit prices and a specified quantity for, inter alia, base and surface
asphalt. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 31 at 359.) The unit prices in this subcontract expressly included
the cost of any mobilizations that Fort Myer would incur to complete the project. (Appellant’s
Hr’g Ex. 31 at 357; Hr’g Tr. 683:14-17, 762:5-22.) The subcontract expressly incorporated
Civil’s prime contract with the District but, inexplicably, did not incorporate the two-block
restriction in the Change Order that the District had previously issued on May 19, 2005.5 (See
Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 31 at 363-64.)                 Fort Myer only anticipated that 10
mobilizations/demobilizations would be required to perform the subcontract. (Hr’g Tr. 687:2-
690:12, 762:19.)

16.     By September 8, 2005, Civil had completed work on the north side of F Street between
23rd Street and 21st Streets. (AF Ex. C.11 at 3.) Civil completed work along the south side of F
Street between 23rd Street and 21st Streets on or about December 12, 2005. (Id. at 4.)

17.    After finishing work between 23rd Street and 21st Street, Civil began work on the north
side of F Street between 20th Street and 18th Street. (Hr’g Tr. 103:11-104:20.) Civil was
required to temporarily bypass the block between 21st Street and 20th Street due to dormitory



5
  The subcontract specifically included a provision under which the parties were to indicate any modifications made
to the prime contract prior to the execution of the subcontract. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 31 at 364.) While this
provision referenced wage determinations and equal opportunity requirements, it made no mention of the May 19,
2005, Change Order. (See Id.)

construction/renovation work being performed by a third party, Donohoe Construction, on behalf
of the George Washington University (“GWU”).6 (Hr’g Tr. 105:2-7.)

Rescission of the Change Order

18.     While Civil was performing work on the north side of F Street between 20th and 18th
Streets, the CO rescinded the May 19, 2005, Change Order, by a letter dated January 19, 2006,
largely as the result of its recognition of the resulting performance impact upon Civil’s project
schedule. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 34; Hr’g Tr. 256:16, 890:5-891:7.) This letter expressly
rescinded the two-block restriction immediately, although it still required that Civil submit a
revised schedule to the District for review and approval prior to starting work on the 1700 block
of F Street. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 34.)

19.     On March 7, 2006, Civil submitted a revised schedule to the District (“Revised Schedule
#3”). (Hr’g Tr. 245:5-246:19, Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 11.) The revised schedule included Civil’s
actual progress through February 22, 2006, and set a new completion date of June 2, 2007, for
the project. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 11.)

20.    The Appellant did not begin work on the 1700 block of F Street immediately after
submitting the March 7, 2006 schedule; rather the Appellant interpreted the CO’s January 19,
2006, directive as requiring District approval of the revised schedule prior to proceeding with
work on that block.7 (Hr’g Tr. 246:5-247:19.)

21.      The District rejected Civil’s Revised Schedule #3 on March 15, 2006. (AF Ex. C.17.)
The District took issue with four activities that were added to the critical path and the additional
duration of five activities, which added up to an additional 112 working days. (Id.) The District
also claimed that the schedule did not reflect the current status of activities. (Id.)

22.      The Appellant resubmitted Revised Schedule #3 on March 20, 2006. (Appellant’s Hr’g
Ex. 17 at 193-204.) In its resubmission, the Appellant included a narrative defending those
elements of its schedule that the District previously found problematic and which were the basis
for its rejection of Civil’s earlier version of the Revised Schedule #3 that had been submitted on
March 7, 2006. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 17 at 194.)

23.    In response to Civil’s resubmission of Revised Schedule #3, on April 5, 2006, another
consultant for the District, Alpha Corporation, issued a report (the “Alpha Report”) analyzing the
propriety of Appellant’s Revised Schedule #3. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 17.) In summary, the
Alpha Report identified 14 different aspects of Civil’s revised schedule that it deemed either
inaccurate, incomplete, and/or requiring further details. (Id. at 183-84.) Moreover, the Alpha
Report concluded that, as of February 22, 2006, the F Street Project was delayed 90 calendar
days as a result of the Change Order which imposed the two-block construction restriction for

6
  Civil first learned of this ongoing work during an October 12, 2005, progress meeting, according to the meeting
minutes. (Appellant’s Expert Report Ex. 7 at 65.) At a November 30, 2005, progress meeting, Civil was informed
that the dormitory construction for GWU would not be complete until about late April or early May 2006.
(Appellant’s Expert Report Ex. 8 at 169.)

  John Constantino, Civil’s general superintendent, testified, however, that the Appellant never stopped work on the
F Street Project. (Hr’g Tr. 275:15-276:4.)

the performance of the contract.8 (Id. at 182.)        The Alpha Report also created a new
performance schedule for the contract with a completion date of August 7, 2006. (Id. at 223-31.)

24.    On or around April 7, 2006, the Appellant was instructed by District representatives to
proceed with work on the 1700 block without an approved schedule. (Hr’g Tr. 119:17-120:15,
250:2-9.)

25.    On April 10, 2006, the District rejected Civil’s Revised Schedule #3. (AF Ex. C.18.)
The District provided numerous bases for rejecting this schedule, which appear to be based upon
the conclusions in the Alpha Report, and also included a new contract completion date of August
7, 2006, for the project. (Cf. AF Ex. C.18, with Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 17 at 183-185.)

26.     On April 27, 2006, Civil responded to the District’s April 10, 2006, letter and disagreed
with the 14 areas of concern raised by the District as the basis for its rejection of Civil’s Revised
Schedule #3. (AF Ex. C.20.) In this regard, the Appellant advised the District that its rejection
of the revised schedule was based upon a lack of background information about the project and
an attempt to artificially reduce the duration of the project. (Id. at 1.) By way of example, Civil
disagreed with the District’s conclusion that Civil’s revised schedule showed no planned work
activities between certain periods of time by pointing to specific work activities that were
occurring within the timeframes at issue. (Id.) In another instance, Civil defended its claimed
winter shutdown periods and claimed that certain activities could not be completed during cold
weather. (Id.)

Civil’s Performance after Rescission of the Change Order

27.     At no point during Civil’s performance of the F Street Project did the District approve
Civil’s work schedule. (Hr’g Tr. 152:2, 187:7, 933:9-13.) Civil, however, continued to perform
on the F Street Project without stopping work. (Hr’g Tr. 275:7-276:4.) Civil completed
construction along the north side of F Street on or about July 10, 2006.9 (See Appellant’s Expert
Report 14; Hr’g Tr. 443:14-445:2 (Feb. 29, 2012).)

28.      Civil also worked on two additional F Street projects concurrent with its work for the
District. From July 11 through July 17, 2006, Civil worked on excavating a communications
duct bank for GWU between 21st and 20th Streets. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 24 at 262-66.) The
work for GWU was done under a separate contract and had to be performed concurrently with
the F Street Project due to the District of Columbia’s five-year moratorium on digging along
newly constructed roads that would have otherwise precluded GWU from having this work done
for a five year period after the contract was completed. (Hr’g Tr. 260:4-262:17, 282:1-14.)

29.    Civil also worked on an additional duct bank under contract with the federal General
Service Administration (“GSA”) between 17th and 18th Streets because GSA also sought to
have this work completed before the five year moratorium on newly constructed roads would

8
  The Alpha Report also speculates that some of the delay may have been due to concurrent delay caused by Civil.
(Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 17 at 182.) However, the Alpha Report contains no support for that assertion.
9
  The document supporting this date appears to be taken from a District Inspector’s daily report that was not
included in the record. However, it is consistent with the daily reports that were included in the record. (See
Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 24 at 260-62.)

temporarily preclude its ability to have this work done at a later time. (Hr’g Tr. 262:1-17.) This
construction lasted from August 17, 2006, through September 27, 2006. (See generally
Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 24; Hr’g Tr. 267:14-297:12.) This work for GSA was extended beyond its
original completion date, in part, due to work stoppages at the direction of the Secret Service.
(Hr’g Tr. 241:5-244:12.)

30.  Civil substantially completed performance on the F Street Project on December 20,
2006—a project duration of 591 days. (SF 15.)

Civil’s Claims

31.    On April 27, 2006, the Appellant submitted its first claim to the CO requesting a final
decision on its July 15, 2005, request for a formal change order. (AF Ex. C.19.)

32.     At some point thereafter, the CO scheduled a meeting with the Appellant to discuss its
April 27, 2006, claim. (Hr’g Tr. 129:7, 145:3, 930:2.) The CO subsequently halted this meeting
based upon his belief that negotiation efforts with the Appellant regarding its claim would be
futile. (Hr’g Tr. 129:7-130:15, 931:2-3.)

33.     Subsequently, on June 16, 2006, the CO issued a final decision denying the majority of
the Appellant’s April 27, 2006, claim. (AF Ex. A.1.) The CO’s decision, however, granted Civil
a 90 day time extension to complete the contract by August 6, 2006. (Id.) The CO also awarded
Civil an additional $204,000.00 in compensation for its damages and extended jobsite overhead
costs arising from the Change Order.10 (Id.) The CO’s decision expressly noted that this time
extension and additional compensation to the Appellant were granted as damages resulting from
the Change Order that altered the original construction work phasing requirements in the
Maintenance of Traffic plans incorporated into the contract. (Id.)

34.     On June 19, 2006, the CO issued a formal change order reflecting his final decision on
Appellant’s April 27, 2006 claim, which granted some compensation to Civil in connection with
the Change Order. (AF Ex. B.4.) This change order expressly included unabsorbed home office
costs (including unabsorbed field and home office costs) in the $204,000.00 compensation
awarded to Civil. (Id.)

35.    Civil appealed the CO’s June 16, 2006, final decision to this Board on September 6,
2006. (Sept. 6, 2006, Notice of Appeal.) We docketed the appeal as CAB No. D-1294.

36.    On August 23, 2007, Fort Myer submitted a request for an equitable adjustment to Civil
in the amount of $40,894.26 seeking damages related to additional mobilizations and
demobilizations, which it performed which it claims were beyond the scope of the contract.
(Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 40.) Specifically, Fort Myer’s request for an equitable adjustment
included the cost of 13 additional mobilization/demobilization efforts (in addition to the 10 that
Fort Myer had originally anticipated) at $1700.00 per mobilization, additional supervisory
expenses, inefficiency expenses, and increased labor and material costs, which it claims to have
incurred as the result of the District’s Change Order. (Id.)

     Civil has been paid the $204,000.00 awarded in the CO’s final decision. (Hr’g Tr. 146:19-147:7)

37.    On August 3, 2010, the Appellant submitted a claim to the CO seeking unabsorbed
extended home office overhead costs for the 90 day period between May 8, 2006, and August 6,
2006, in the amount of $108,900.00 using the Eichleay formula.11 (Nov. 8, 2010 Notice of
Appeal.)

38.    On August 12, 2010, Civil similarly submitted a second claim for unabsorbed overhead
using the Eichleay formula for the 122 day period between August 7, 2006, and December 9,
2006, in the amount of $147,620.00. (Nov. 18, 2010 Notice of Appeal.)

39.     Civil appealed to this Board from the deemed denials of both of these overhead claims
after the CO failed to issue a final decision on these two claims. (Nov. 8, 2010 Notice of Appeal;
Nov. 18, 2010 Notice of Appeal.) We docketed the appeals as CAB No. 1413 and CAB No. D-
1417, respectively. We consolidated the Appellant’s three appeals relating to the F Street project
on June 2, 2011.

40.     The Appellant filed an amended complaint with regard to the consolidated appeals on
February 21, 2012. The Amended Complaint seeks an equitable adjustment in the amount of
$1,033,014.61. (Am. Compl. 6.) This amount includes $324,508.26 for its Field Labor Increase;
$198,659.28 for its Equipment Increase; $16,849.80 for Additional Scheduling Requirements;
$227,503.26 for Extended Field Overhead Increases; $205,523.58 for Extended Home Office
Overhead Increases; and also includes a combined amount of $59,970.43 on behalf of its
electrical and asphalt subcontractors (Central Armature and Fort Myer, respectively).12 (Am.
Compl. 6-7.)

The Appellant’s Calculation of Delay Impacts

41.     The Board conducted a four day hearing on the merits in these consolidated cases
beginning on February 28, 2012, based primarily upon the Appellant’s appeal from the CO’s
denial of its April 27, 2006, claim.

42.      At the hearing, the Appellant employed an expert, Scott A. Galbraith, to provide a report
and various schedules, with his corresponding testimony, to substantiate the Appellant’s claimed
delay impact and damages arising from the District’s issuance of the Change Order immediately
after it began performance of the contract. Galbraith relied upon several primary resources in
making his delay and impact findings, and his damage calculation. In particular, Galbraith
reviewed the following materials to corroborate his findings as to the events that occurred during
contract performance: 1) project schedules that Civil submitted to the District; 2) daily contract
performance reports internally generated by the District; 3) Civil’s July 15, 2005, cost estimate

11
   The Eichleay formula was originally set forth by the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals in Eichleay
Corp., ASBCA No. 5183, 60-2 BCA ¶ 2688 (July 29, 1960) to equitably determine the allocation of unabsorbed
overhead incurred due to government-caused delay. Nicon, Inc. v. United States, 331 F.3d 878, 882 (Fed. Cir.
2003). “The Eichleay formula requires three steps: 1) to find allocable contract overhead, multiply the total
overhead cost incurred during the contract period times the ratio of billings from the delayed contract to total
billings of the firm during the contract period; 2) to get the daily contract overhead rate, divide allocable contract
overhead by days of contract performance; and 3) to get the amount recoverable, multiply the daily contract
overhead rate times days of government-caused delay.” Wicham Contracting Co. v. Fischer, 12 F.3d 1574, 1577 n.3
(Fed. Cir. 1994).
12
   The Amended Complaint also sought $1,000.00 representing the unpaid balance on the contract. (Am. Compl. 6.)

for the project; 4) the CO’s final decision; and 5) documents produced by the District during the
course of this litigation. (Appellant’s Expert Report 3-4; see also Hr’g Tr. 396:10-402:1.)
Moreover, Galbraith’s report compared, inter alia, Civil’s original base line schedule (a forward-
looking schedule) with as-built data as of February 21, 2006, and with Civil’s final as-built
schedule. (Id. at 266.)

43.     As part of his analysis, and as discussed further below, Galbraith identified delays to
Civil’s performance of the contract within four specific periods of performance using a critical
path method (“CPM”) time impact analysis. (Appellant’s Expert Report 12-18; Hr’g Tr. 409:18-
410:15.) Because the CO’s Final Decision, and the Alpha Report upon which it was based,
covered delays incurred through February 21, 2006, Galbraith’s CPM analysis was limited to the
period from February 22, 2006 until substantial completion of the project.13 (See Id. at 12.)

        Impact Period No. 1 (February 22, 2006 through March 7, 2006)

44.     The first delay impact period identified by Galbraith covers the period February 22, 2006,
through March 7, 2006, when Civil first submitted Revised Schedule #3.14 (Appellant’s Expert
Report 12-13; Hr’g Tr. 535:12-536:22.) As an initial matter, Galbraith determined that, as of
February 22, 2006, the F Street Project was already delayed by 140 calendar days.15 (Id. at 11;
Hr’g Tr. 408:7-412:15.) This 140 day delay period, as determined by Galbraith, is the numerical
difference between when the project was originally scheduled to be completed on May 8, 2006,
and the date which Galbraith subsequently projected the contract to be completed on September
25, 2006, as discussed below. (Appellant’s Expert Report 11; Hr’g Tr. 412:2-7.) Galbraith
attributed the entire 140 day delay as due to the Change Order’s two-block restriction. (Id. at 19;
see also Hr’g Tr. 403:11.)

45.     In arriving at the determination that there was a 140 day delay, Galbraith began by
reviewing Civil’s Revised Schedule #3, which contained the as built data through February 21,
2006. (Appellant’s Expert Report 7-8; see also Hr’g Tr. 413:16-414:5.) For purposes of
comparison, Galbraith then recreated the schedule generated by the Alpha Report using the
report’s seven recommendations, which led the District to determine that the contract’s new
completion date was August 7, 2006. (Id. at 9.) Galbraith, however, found that Alpha’s
schedule was flawed because it did not restore Civil’s original sequencing of performing utility
work activities before street level work activities within a given block and on a given side of F
Street. (Id. at 9-10; see also Hr’g Tr. 568:5-570:19.) In particular, the schedule contained in the
Alpha Report shows utility work and street-level work being performed at the same time.
(Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 17 at 223-24, 229-30.) However, in order to create a schedule consistent
with the intent of Civil’s original work sequence plan, Galbraith added relationships and
predecessors to certain activities in the Alpha schedule to restore Civil’s planned sequencing to

13
   At the time of the District’s rescission of the two-block work area restriction in January 2006, Civil’s work zone
was established along the north side of F Street between 20th and 18th Streets. See supra finding 18.
14
   The expert noted that by the end of 2005 Civil had completed utilities and street work through base paving
activities from 23rd Street to 21st Street on both the north and south sides of F Street. (Appellant’s Expert Report
6; see also Hr’g Tr. 254:7 (John M. Constantino testifying that this was the first section worked).)
15
   The February 22, 2006, date indicates that the data leading up to this date is based on Civil’s as-built schedule,
and is the same February 22, 2006 “data date” used in Civil’s March 7, 2006, Revised Schedule #3. (Hr’g Tr. 411:9;
Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 11.)

                                                                            CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

complete the contract. (Appellant’s Expert Report 10-11; Hr’g Tr. 569:10-570:19.) With these
changes, Galbraith established a new schedule showing all work completed on September 25,
2006, 140 days after the original May 8, 2006, completion date. (Id. at 11, 255-61; Hr’g Tr.
536:2-536:8.)

46.     Galbraith also determined that Civil was delayed an additional 14 days between February
22, 2006, and March 7, 2006, when it was precluded from working between 17th and 18th streets
because it was preparing a revised contract performance schedule for approval by the District
before it fully mobilized onto the project again, as required by the CO’s January 19, 2006, letter.
(Appellant’s Expert Report 12-13; Hr’g Tr. 416:11-420:20.)

        Impact Period No. 2 (March 8, 2006 through July 17, 2006)

47.     Galbraith identified a second impact period between March 8, 2006, and July 17, 2006,
which covers the period between Civil’s submission of its revised schedule and when Civil
actually started performing the Phase 2 utility activities on the south side of F Street between
21st Street and 17th Street. (Appellant’s Expert Report 13; Hr’g Tr. 430:7-430:10.) In other
words, Galbraith defined this impact period to include the completion of the north side of F
Street (through base paving) from 21st Street to 17th Street. Galbraith determined that during
this time period, Civil had incurred an additional 33 calendar days of delay. (Id. at 13-15; see
also Hr’g Tr. 430:7-430:16.) Galbraith assigned 32 calendar days of delay during this period to
Civil for failing to mobilize on the 1700 block of F Street until April 8, 2006, without a District-
approved schedule despite having submitted a revised schedule to the District for approval after
the Change Order was rescinded. (Id. at 15; see also Hr’g Tr. 430:20-431:1.)

48.     Further, Galbraith determined that during this same time period Civil’s progress on the
contract was also impacted by many other critical delays, totaling 22 calendar days of delay, for
which Civil was not responsible including: 1) delay attributable to Secret Service stop work
orders (1 calendar day); 2) weather impacts after original contract completion date (13 calendar
days);16 3) traffic switch from north to south side of F Street (1 calendar day); and 4) additional
duct bank work required for GWU (7 calendar days).17 (Appellant’s Expert Report 15; see also
Hr’g Tr. 435:2-450:13.) Galbraith, however, determined that Civil was able to overcome 21 of
these overall 54 calendar days of delay during this period and, therefore, that Civil was only
responsible for 11 of the total 33 total critical delay days during this timeframe.18 (Id.) At the
hearing on the merits in this matter, this expert testified extensively about his basis for these
finding of delays in delay impact period No. 2 that were attributable to Civil and others. (See
generally Hr’g Tr. 429:17-450:13.)




16
   The 13 days of weather impact include 11 days of adverse weather and 2 days as a conversion from work days to
calendar days. (Appellant’s Expert Report 14; see also Hr’g Tr. 436:12-437:11.)
17
   While Galbraith found that Donohoe Construction’s work for GWU delayed Civil’s work for 79 days during this
period, he determined that this delay was not along the critical path of the project. (Appellant’s Expert Report 14;
see also Hr’g Tr. 431:12.)
18
   Galbraith determined the ultimate 33 delays of delay based upon subtracting Civil 21 day “credit” for overcoming
delays during this time period from the original 54 days of delay which Galbraith found to have occurred during this
time period. (Appellant’s Expert Report 14-15; Hr’g Tr. 448:4-449:7.)

                                                                            CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

        Impact Period No. 3 (July 18, 2006 through September 27, 2006)

49.     The third delay impact period identified by Galbraith ranged from the period of July 18,
2006, through September 27, 2006, beginning after Civil completed its prior duct bank work for
GWU on the south side of the 2000 block of F Street. (Appellant’s Expert Report 15; see also
Hr’g Tr. 447:19-449:7.) This third period in Galbraith’s analysis encompassed Civil’s start of
Phase 2 utilities activities along the south side of F Street between 21st Street and 17th Street to
the start of Phase 3 street-level work along the south side of F Street between 18th and 17th
Streets. (Id.) During this period, Galbraith attributed 40 days of delay to others because of the
additional duct bank installation work that Civil was required to do under a separate contract
with the GSA, which was a critical impact to the project schedule.19 (Id. at 16; see also Hr’g Tr.
447:19-449:7.) In culmination, as of September 28, 2006, the project was 87 calendar days
behind its forecasted critical path, of which 14 calendar days were accounted for in the first
impact period, 33 calendar days were accounted for in the second delay impact period, and 40
days of delay were included from delay impact period No. 3. (Appellant’s Expert Report 16; see
also Hr’g Tr. 447:19-449:7.)

        Impact Period No. 4 (September 28, 2006 through Substantial Completion)

50.     The final period identified by Galbraith, from September 28, 2006, through December 20,
2006, covers Civil’s start of Phase 3 street-level activities and concludes with the placement of
surface asphalt paving and striping activities for the entire length of the project (i.e., substantial
completion of the contract). (Appellant’s Expert Report 17-18; see also Hr’g Tr. 409:1-409:18.)
Galbraith attributed five delay days in this period to the District consisting of a November 8,
2006, weather delay and four days of delay due to the Thanksgiving holiday.20 (Id. at 18; see
also Hr’g Tr. 539:19-540:19.) However, Galbraith credited Civil with overcoming 6 days of
delay, resulting in a net gain of 1 day during this period. (Id.)

        Total Impact

51.      Between the four identifiable delay impact periods on the project noted above, Civil’s
expert, in referencing findings in his expert report, testified that the project was delayed for a
total of 226 days. (Hr’g Tr. 408:7-22, 455:9; see also Appellant’s Expert Report 19.) Of this
total of 226 delay days, Galbraith concluded that 169 of these delay days were attributable to the
District as the result of its issuance of the Change Order which changed the original construction
traffic sequencing requirements in the contract. (Hr’g Tr. 540:12-541:17.) These 169 days of
delay include 140 days of delay which Galbraith determined had been caused by the District
after it issued the Change Order on May 19, 2005, through February 21, 2006. (Hr’g Tr. 538:4-
541:17.) It also includes the 14 days of delay which Galbraith attributed to the District for
requiring that Civil prepare and submit Revised Schedule #3 after the two-block restriction was
rescinded before it could resume work on the project, and also another 1 day delay arising from
the requirement that Civil switch the traffic barrier for the work zone from the north side to the

19
   Although Galbraith determined that issues with Pepco and Washington Gas delayed Civil by 12 days and 11 days,
respectively, he concluded that neither of these delays were on the critical path. (Appellant’s Expert Report 16-17.)
20
   On cross examination, Galbraith testified that the Thanksgiving holiday delay should be attributed to the
additional duct bank work under Civil’s contract with the General Services Administration. (Hr’g Tr. 539:19-
540:11.)

south side of F Street on July 10, 2006.21 (Id.; see also Appellant’s Expert Report Ex. 19 at 266.)
Also, Galbraith included in the total 169 delay days attributed to the District another 14 days of
delay because of adverse weather conditions which Civil encountered, which stopped work for
14 days, during the extended contract performance period.22 (Hr’g Tr. 540:1-541:4.)

The Appellant’s Damages Calculation

52.     Galbraith, in his expert report, ultimately determined that, based upon the delay days
attributable to the District, that Civil is entitled to $1,060,273.4523 in additional compensation
resulting from the two-block restriction mandated by the May 19, 2005, Change Order.
(Appellant’s Expert Report 25; Hr’g Tr. 479:5.) Galbraith arrived at this figure by computing
several different areas of costs. (Id. at 19-25; see also Hr’g Tr. 479:2-480:18.)

53.     In calculating increased labor and equipment costs, Galbraith created an estimate based
on a daily rate using Civil’s as-bid labor costs as submitted in support of its July 15, 2005, good
faith estimate. (Appellant’s Expert Report 20-22; see also Hr’g Tr. 468:9-469:20.) According to
Galbraith, the actual costs could not be determined because no portion of the F Street Project was
unimpacted by the two-block restriction, which precluded him from alternatively performing a
calculation of extended labor damages based upon actual labor costs. (Id. at 20.)

        Labor Costs

54.    With regard to labor costs, Galbraith determined that Civil was entitled to an additional
$351,766.83. (Appellant’s Expert Report 21; see also Hr’g Tr. 465:18-468:2.) Using Civil’s as-
bid labor and burdened labor costs, Galbraith established a daily labor rate of $2,021.65.24 (Id.)
Galbraith multiplied this by the 17425 delay days he had attributed to the District, resulting in his
$351,766.83 estimate in Appellant’s alleged increased field labor costs.26 (Id.)

55.     On cross examination, the District questioned Galbraith as to why he used 350 days
rather than 365 in deriving the daily rate. (Hr’g Tr. 542:10-544:18.) Galbraith testified that he
21
   Galbraith, nonetheless, found that the delays which occurred as the result of Civil performing duct bank work for
GWU (7 calendar delay days) and the Secret Service (40 calendar delay days) under separate contracts were non-
compensable. (Hr’g Tr. 532:9.)
22
   Galbraith, however, admitted during the hearing that his expert report contained a typographical error in that, in
several instances there were narratives stating that the District was responsible for 174 delay days instead of 169
delay days identified in other sections of the expert report. (Hr’g Tr. 541:9-542:9.)
23
   At trial, Galbraith submitted a revised expert report in which he determined that the Appellant was owed
$1,060,273.45, an increase from the $1,033,014.61 claimed in his initial expert report. (Appellant’s Expert Report
25.) This revision stems from a correction made to his labor cost calculation discussed below. (See Hr’g Tr. 394:1-
395:1.)
24
   Civil’s as-bid labor and burdened labor costs totaled $909,528.86. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 4 at 76.) Galbraith
subtracted from this amount $201,952, which represents Civil’s foreman costs, giving an adjusted as-bid labor costs
of $707,576.86. (Appellant’s Expert Report 21; see also Hr’g Tr. 395:20-396:1.) Galbraith then divided by 350
days for “planned on-site duration” to establish a daily labor rate of $2,021.65. (Id.)
25
   See supra note 22.
26
   Originally, Galbraith subtracted $256,784.00 as representing foremen labor costs. (Appellant’s Expert Report 21;
see also Hr’g Tr. 465:18-468:2.) This number represents the actual foremen labor costs incurred. (Hr’g Tr. 393:15-
394:21.) Upon discovering the error, Galbraith went through Civil’s as-bid cost report and totaled the various
foremen labor items, which totaled $201,952. (Hr’g Tr. 465:2-466:8.) Using the original figure, Galbraith had
calculated a daily labor rate of $1,864.99 and a total amount owed of $324,508.26. (Appellant’s Expert Report 21.)

                                                                               CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

used 350 days because under Civil’s original baseline schedule 350 days was the original
duration that Civil planned to be on the project until it was completed. (Hr’g Tr. 466:16, 543:5-
544:18.)

          Equipment Costs

56.    Galbraith also determined that Civil was due an additional $198,659.28 in equipment
costs. (Appellant’s Expert Report 22; see also Hr’g Tr. 469:3-470:3.) Using a similar
methodology, Galbraith established a daily equipment rate of $1,141.72, utilizing Civil’s as-bid
equipment costs as a baseline.27 (Id.) Galbraith multiplied the adjusted daily rate by 17428
calendar delay days, resulting in $198,659.28 for the Appellant’s estimated compensable
equipment overrun. (Id.)

57.     The actual cost data, however, which the Appellant introduced at the hearing, set forth
that Civil’s actual incurred equipment costs for the project were $563,372.88 for owned
equipment and $28,126.12 for rented equipment. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 25 at 304-05.) Using
this actual cost data, the Board calculates that Civil incurred $591,499.00 in equipment costs.

         Scheduling Costs

58.     Upon Galbraith’s request, Daniel Mullally, Civil’s Chief Financial Officer, generated its
accounts payable report for CPM scheduling. (Hr’g Tr. 306:16; Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 36.) The
report showed invoices for CPM scheduling from two subcontractors, Contractors Engineering
Services and McDonough Bolyard Peck, Galbraith’s employer. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 36.)
Contractors Engineering Services submitted 12 invoices, approximately 1 per month, beginning
April 2005, through September 2006, for a total of $6,790.00. (Id.) McDonough, submitted 5
invoices from August 2006 through August 2007, with the first invoice for $10,000.00 and all 5
totaling $18,466.20. (Id.)

59.     According to Galbraith, Civil anticipated providing the District with 12 schedules
throughout the performance period. (Hr’g Tr. 473:11.) Civil estimated the cost of each schedule
to be $450.00. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 4 at 69.)

60.     Galbraith determined that Civil incurred an               additional $15,318.00 in scheduling costs.
(Appellant’s Expert Report 23; see also Hr’g Tr.                  473:12-473:15.) Galbraith arrived at this
amount by adding the Civil Engineering Services                   invoices and the three 2006 McDonough
invoices and subtracting $5,400.00 representing the               cost of the 12 schedules planned under the
original contract. (Hr’g Tr. 472:12-473:15.)




27
   Civil’s original bid included $449,850.60 in equipment costs. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 4 at 76.) Again using 350
days, Galbraith determined a daily rate of $1,285.29. (Appellant’s Expert Report 22; see also Hr’g Tr. 469:3-470:3.)
Galbraith then divided the 350 planned days by the 591 day total duration of the project to arrive at an estimated
59.22% in use rate. (Id.; see also Hr’g Tr. 469:3-20.) Galbraith multiplied the daily rate by the in use percentage to
arrive at a $761.15 in use daily rate. (Id.) Galbraith determined an idle rate of half the in use rate, or $380.57. (Id.)
Galbraith then added the two for an adjusted daily equipment rate of $1,141.72. (Id.)

         Field Overhead

61.     Galbraith, using a daily rate of $1,307.49,29 determined that Civil was entitled to an
additional $227,503.26 for field overhead by multiplying the daily rate by the 17430 days of
delay he attributed to the District. (Appellant’s Expert Report 24; see also Hr’g Tr. 467:8.) This
calculation was largely based upon internal corporate data that was provided to Galbraith by
Civil’s Financial Officer, Daniel Mullally.

62.     Mullally testified as to various documents he prepared in support of the Appellant’s
request for field overhead costs. Mullally’s testimony described Civil’s payroll documents
which showed it incurred $580,457.60 for its foremen and project managers.31 (Hr’g Tr. 302:8-
306:19.) Mullally further testified as to the accuracy and completeness of the internal cost data
supporting its field office and safety officer costs. (Hr’g Tr. 333:17-336:11.) This cost data
established that during the contract period, Civil paid $136,690.56 in salary and benefits for a
safety officer. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 38 at 1.) Civil, however, only allocated 20 percent of the
safety officer’s salary, $27,338.11, to the F Street Project. (Id.) Civil’s cost data further showed
that during the contract period Civil incurred $44,165.00 in rent for its field office and other
general conditions costs. (Id. at 4.)

         Extended Home Office Overhead

63.    Mullally testified at length as to his calculations concerning Civil’s incurred extended
home office overhead costs under the Eichleay formula and the data supporting his calculations
because the Appellant also seeks to recover these costs. (Hr’g Tr. 323:7-333:2; see also
Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 37.) Galbraith independently reviewed the same actual billings and
overhead cost information provided by Mullally and concluded that extended overhead costs
were due to Civil based upon a daily rate of $1,187.17, for a total of $205,523.58. (Appellant’s
Expert Report 25; see also Hr’g Tr. 478:18-479:1.)

Subcontractor Claims

         Central Armature Works

64.      Central Armature was an electrical subcontractor for Civil in support of the F Street
project and is also seeking delay damages in this action through its prime contractor, Civil.
Civil’s original request to the District for the issuance of a formal Change Order on July 15,
2005, to cover its increased performance costs associated with the two-block construction
restriction include estimated increased costs for its electrical subcontractor for the project,
Central Armature, in the amount of $101,582.00. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 4 at 59-62.) However,

29
   In deriving this figure, Galbraith added 20 percent of the safety officer’s salary and benefits, $27,338.11, with the
payroll costs of Civil’s foremen, superintendents and other supervisors, $580,457.60, for a total of $607,795.71.
(Appellant’s Expert Report 24; see also Hr’g Tr. 476:13-477:7.) Galbraith then applied a 20 percent markup for
overhead and profit for a total of $729,354.85. (Id.) Galbraith then added $31,959 in rent and $11,412.41 in other
field office costs for a total of $772,726.26. (Id.) Lastly, Galbraith divided the $772,726.26 figure by 591 days to
derive the $1307.49 daily rate.
30
   See supra note 22.
31
   The Board received extensive testimony from the witness verifying this cost data, introduced as Appellant’s
Hearing Exhibit 35, however, this document was not formally moved into evidence by the Appellant.

                                                                          CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

this original amount being claimed by Central Armature was later significantly reduced to
$19,215.11, and then to $15,696.85, as set forth in the expert report. (Appellant’s Expert Report
23; see also Hr’g Tr. 809:20-810:16.)

65.     In outlining Central Armature’s claimed damages in his expert report, Galbraith did not
perform a detailed analysis of Central Armature’s claimed costs, but, instead, seemingly just
accepted these claimed costs from Central Armature in the amount of $19,215.11, and only made
minor adjustments consistent with Civil’s compensable days of delay to arrive at the $15,696.85
figure. (Appellant’s Expert Report 23; Hr’g Tr. 471:1-22.)

66.     At the hearing in this matter, Charles Redding, an electrical superintendent for Central
Armature, provided testimony regarding the basis of this subcontractor claim. Redding,
however, could offer no testimony regarding the basis for the downward adjustment in Central
Armature’s original claim from $101,582.00 to $19,215.11, nor could he identify any contract
related documents or other information that could provide the cost details underlying the
damages claimed by Central Armature related to the F Street project. (See generally Hr’g Tr.
803:2-813:13, 819:1-820:20.)

        Fort Myer Construction

67.     Fort Myer was another subcontractor that supported the F Street Project by providing
asphalt related services. Fort Myer is seeking additional compensation under its subcontract with
the Appellant for 13 additional mobilizations, which it alleges that it was required to perform as
a result of the Change Order requirements. In determining the amount owed to Fort Myer,
Galbraith adjusted the labor and material escalation figures contained in Fort Myer’s August 23,
2007, Request for Equitable Adjustment to reflect his finding of 17432 delay days that were
compensable to Civil. (Appellant’s Expert Report 23, Hr’g Tr. 471:3-14.) Performing this
calculation, Galbraith downwardly adjusted Fort Myer’s $40,498.26 claimed amount to
$38,821.72. (Appellant’s Expert Report 23; see also Hr’g Tr. 740:1-16.)

68.     Fort Myer’s underlying August 23, 2007, Request for an Equitable Adjustment identified
23 days on which it mobilized to perform work on the F Street Project. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex.
40.) Fort Myer requested $1700.00 for each mobilization and corresponding demobilization for
13 of the 23 days, for a total of $22,100.00. (Id.) Fort Myer further requested $1,430.00 in
additional supervisory costs for the 13 additional days. (Id.) Fort Myer also sought $6,045.00 in
inefficiency costs. (Id.) Fort Myer stated that it incurred a 4% escalation in labor costs, at
$3,824.47. (Id.) Lastly, Fort Myer sought $7,494.79 as a 3% escalation in material costs. (Id.)

69.      At the hearing, Ralph Kew, a vice president of Fort Myer, stated that Fort Myer needed to
increase its claimed amount from $38,821.72 to $106,217.26. (Hr’g Tr. 740:1-6.) First, Kew
testified that Fort Myer had discovered an additional 3 daily reports that showed that Fort Myer
mobilized for work on 26 days for the F Street Project, instead of the 23 days used in its August
23, 2007, Request for an Equitable Adjustment. (Hr’g Tr. 695:2-19.) Kew then testified that Fort
Myer had audited its finances and determined that the cost of each mobilization was $3,926.76.33

32
  See supra note 22.
33
  Appellant’s Hearing Exhibit 26, however, indicates a mobilization cost of either $3,926.76 or $4,749, depending
on the work performed.

                                                                          CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

(Hr’g Tr. 698:1-703:22; see also Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 26.) Kew further stated that Fort Myer
was seeking costs for 42 mobilizations, treating mobilizations and demobilizations separately
and subtracting the 10 anticipated mobilization/demobilizations. (Hr’g Tr. 707:14-708:8.)

70.     Kew further testified that based on audited costs, Fort Myer’s additional supervisory
costs for the F Street Project were $3,802.56. (Hr’g Tr. 713:13-720:19.) Kew also testified as to
a document allegedly supporting labor escalation costs of $3,824.47.34 (Hr’g Tr. 723:2-727:17.)
Lastly, Kew testified, using randomly chosen dates from an asphalt index, that a 3 percent
materials cost increase of $7,494.79 was reasonable, which he applied to the amounts being
claimed by Fort Myer. (Hr’g Tr. 730:1-738:7; see also Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 28.) Based upon
these factors, Kew testified that Fort Myer’s total mobilization costs should be $91,095.48.
(Hr’g Tr. 710:22.)

The District’s Contentions

71.     The District only offered one witness at the hearing, Contracting Officer Jerry Carter, to
discuss the impact to the Appellant in connection with the District’s Article 3 Change Order.
The CO testified that the Article 3 change to the maintenance of traffic impacted Civil’s
schedule. (Hr’g Tr. 887:2-8.) The CO, however, testified that the two-block restriction only
delayed the project by 90 days. (Hr’g Tr. 887:16-20.) CO Carter also testified that he believed
that upon lifting the two-block restriction in his January 19, 2006 letter, Civil was immediately
free to begin work on the 1700 block of F Street. (Hr’g Tr. 897:13-898:17, 919:7-920:21.)

72.     CO Carter testified that he did not know the basis for computing the $204,000.00 amount
that he awarded to the Appellant in his final decision, which assessed the overall delay impact to
contract performance caused by the Change Order. (Hr’g Tr. 940:2-20.) The CO, however, did
testify that this amount included extended overhead costs. (Hr’g Tr. 908:12.) Moreover, the
District offered no additional witnesses at the hearing to validate the basis for its contention that
the Appellant was entitled to only $204,000.00 for the Change Order, nor did the District
produce any witnesses to present oral or written testimony to refute the expert findings made by
Galbraith regarding the cause of critical project delays.

                                              JURISDICTION

        The Board has jurisdiction to hear any “appeal by the contractor from a final decision by
the contracting officer on a claim by the contractor, when such claim arises under or relates to a
contract.” D.C. CODE § 2-309.03(a)(2) (repealed 2011).35 The District argues, however, that the
Board lacks jurisdiction because a proper claim was not submitted to the CO. (Dist.’s Post Hr’g
Br. 12-15; see generally Dist. Trial Mem.) The District’s argument rests on the Appellant’s
failure to certify the claim underlying CAB No. D-1294; the District argues that such failure

34
  However, this document was not introduced into evidence.
35
   The Procurement Practices Reform Act of 2010 (“PPRA”) repealed the District of Columbia Procurement
Practices Act of 1985 (“PPA”), as amended by the Procurement Reform Amendment Act of 1996 and codified at
D.C. CODE § 301.01 et seq., and amended and recodified the District’s procurement statutes at D.C. CODE § 2-
351.01 et seq. effective Apr. 8, 2011. Procurement Practices Reform Act of 2010, D.C. Law. No. 18-371, 58 D.C.
Reg. 1185 (Feb. 11, 2011). However, as all the appeals at issue were filed prior to the enactment of the PPRA, the
PPA, as amended, applies to all issues in these consolidated appeals, including our jurisdiction.

                                                                              CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

renders the Appellant’s claim defective.36 (Dist.’s Post Hr’g Br. 12-15; see generally Dist. Trial
Mem.) According to the District, such certification was required by D.C. CODE § 2-303.08 and
by the terms of the contract. (Dist. Trial Mem. 2-4.)

        Under federal procurement law, the Contract Disputes Act (“CDA”) requires contractors
to certify claims over $100,000.00. 41 U.S.C. § 7103(b) (2011 Supp.) (formerly 41 U.S.C. §
605(c)). In interpreting this certification requirement, federal courts and boards have held that
lack of a CDA certification deprives the contracting officer and boards of contract appeals of
jurisdiction over a claim. Tecom v. United States, 732 F.2d 935, 937 (Fed. Cir. 1984); Red Gold,
Inc. v. Dep’t of Agric., CBCA No. 2259, 12-1 BCA ¶ 34,921 (July 6, 2011); Tefirom Insaat
Enerji Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S., ASBCA No. 56,667, 11-1 BCA ¶ 34,628 (Nov. 29, 2010). We
have noted, however, that the District’s procurement statutes do not include language
comparable to the CDA “mandating that contract dispute claims be certified to the CO in the
same manner.” Flippo Constr. Co., CAB No. D-1422, Order on Mot. to Dismiss 2 (Mar. 29,
2012) (unpublished); see also D.C. CODE § 2-308.05 (prescribing the procedure for submission
of claims by a contractor against the District).

         The District’s reliance on D.C. CODE § 2-303.08 is misplaced.37 D.C. CODE § 2-
303.08(a) requires a contractor to submit cost or pricing data for contract awards and
modifications over $100,000.00 and to certify that such cost or pricing data is “accurate,
complete, and current as of a mutually determined specified date.”38 On its face, the foregoing
legal provision explicitly requires a contractor to submit certified cost or pricing data to directly
support a contract, a change order, or a contract modification. This provision does not, on the
other hand, expressly include, or even address, dispute “claims” within the categories of contract
related submissions requiring a supporting cost or pricing certification. Cf. D.C. MUN. REGS. tit.
27, § 3899.1 (2004) (defining a claim as a written demand “seeking, as a matter of right, the
payment of money in a sum certain the adjustment or interpretation of contract terms, or other
relief arising under or relating to the contract.”). Consequently, the requirement for certified cost
or pricing data in D.C. CODE § 2-303.08 is inapplicable to contractor claims.

       For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that a lack of claim certification does not
deprive the Board jurisdiction over the present appeals and the motion to dismiss is denied.
Thus, the Board has jurisdiction over the present appeals pursuant to D.C. CODE § 2-
309.03(a)(2).

                                                  DISCUSSION

       The Appellant seeks an equitable adjustment to cover the increased costs that resulted
from the District’s imposition of the two-block restriction to the F Street Project in the CO’s May
19, 2005, Change Order. (Appellant’s Post Hr’g Br. 3.) To receive an equitable adjustment, a
contractor must show three elements—liability, causation, and resultant injury. Wilner v. United

36
   The Board notes that the contested certification appears in the Appellant’s claims underlying CAB Nos. D-1413
and D-1417.
37
   The District also relies on Article 7(A)(a)(5) of the Standard Contract provisions; however, the District notes that
this provision is derived from the certification requirement in D.C. CODE § 2-303.08(a). (Dist. Trial Mem. 2.)
38
   We have recognized that this requirement is derived from the federal Truth in Negotiations Act, 10 U.S.C. §
2306a. See Careers & Co., CAB No. P-0525, 45 D.C. Reg. 8734, 8737-38 (Feb. 13, 1998).

States, 24 F.3d 1397, 1401 (Fed. Cir. 1994); Servidone Constr. Corp. v. United States, 931 F.2d
860, 861 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The Appellant has the burden of proving its entitlement to an
equitable adjustment by a preponderance of the evidence. A.S. McGaughan Co., CAB No. D-
884, 41 D.C. Reg. 4130, 4135 (Mar. 16, 1994). The Board considers the contracting officer’s
final decision in reviewing a contractor’s claim, but the Board’s review is de novo and the
factual findings of the contracting officer are not attributed any presumed validity. See Ebone,
Inc., CAB Nos. D-971, D-972, 45 D.C. Reg. 8753, 8773 (May 20, 1998).

Entitlement

        Under the original Maintenance of Traffic Specifications in the contract, Civil was
permitted to work on all six blocks of the F Street Project concurrently. (Findings of Fact (“FF”)
3, 6.) In accordance with these specifications, Civil planned to utilize multiple crews
simultaneously progressing through all six blocks of F Street, largely one side of the street at a
time. (FF 5-6.) By restricting the Appellant to a construction sequence of activities of two
blocks at a time, the District substantially disrupted the Appellant’s originally planned sequence
of work, which led to performance inefficiencies and delays. (FF 11.) Indeed, the CO admitted
that this change in the maintenance of traffic specifications in the contract impacted the
Appellant’s schedule, which ultimately led the District to issue a formal change order granting
some relief to the Appellant. (FF 71.) Thus, these basic facts alone are sufficient for the
Appellant to be entitled to an equitable adjustment under the Changes Clause. See H.E. Johnson
Co., ASBCA No. 48248, 97-1 BCA ¶ 28,921 (Oct. 9, 1996) (disruption to contractor’s sequence
of work sufficient for entitlement to an equitable adjustment.)

        Nonetheless, while the District concurs that there was an impact to Civil resulting from
the Article 3 Change Order, to recover delay damages, Civil must demonstrate the extent of the
delay and the causal link between the District’s actions and the extended delay period claimed by
the contractor. Essex Electro Eng’rs, Inc. v. Danzig, 224 F.3d 1283, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In
determining the length of the delay resulting from the two-block restriction, we are cognizant of
the fact that the Appellant performed the entirety of the contract without an approved schedule.
(FF 27.) The District argues that the absence of an approved schedule precludes the Appellant
from recovery.39 (Dist. Post Hr’g Br. 17-18.)

        Typically, to properly demonstrate delay on a project, a CPM schedule must be kept
current and reflect delays as they occur. Preston-Bradley Co., VABAC Nos. 1892 et al., 87-1
BCA 19,649 (Mar. 3, 1987). The critical path method is an efficient means of organizing and
scheduling a complex project consisting of numerous but interrelated smaller projects. Haney v.
United States, 676 F.2d 584, 595 (Ct. Cl. 1982). The subprojects are classified as to duration and
order of precedence. Id. Items determined to be on the critical path are those that if not
performed on schedule will delay the entire project. Id. Accordingly, determining the critical
path is crucial because only work along the critical path has an impact on project completion.

  In support of its argument, the District cites a clause in the contract requiring Civil to submit and regularly update
a CPM schedule. (Dist. Post Hr’g Br. 18.)

                                                                             CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

        While the Board recognizes that Civil did not maintain an up to date CPM schedule at
any point during contract performance, this failure largely stemmed from the disagreement
between the parties as to the impact of the two-block restriction. (See FF 19-26.) Without an
approved baseline schedule reflecting the two-block restriction’s impact on the phasing for the
project, we fail to see how Civil could have provided the updates that the District argues were
necessary for Civil to support its claim. Accordingly, Civil’s inability to get an approved
schedule does not automatically preclude its entitlement to compensatory delay damages,
particularly where Civil’s expert presented the Board with a detailed CPM analysis through an
expert report. See Fortec Constructors, 8 Cl. Ct. at 506.

        In preparing this CPM analysis, the Appellant’s expert reviewed Civil’s original baseline
schedule as well as as-built data. (FF 42.) His analysis took into account numerous categories of
contemporaneous contract and performance documents to corroborate his findings. (FF 42.)
Further, the expert’s analysis accounted for all delays to the project (critical and non-critical), not
simply those caused by the District. (FF 44-51.) Accordingly, the Board finds that the
Appellant’s expert presented credible evidence and testimony, as part of his CPM analysis, to
explain many of the events that occurred during the performance of the contract that resulted in
delays after the issuance of the May 19, 2005, Change Order. See SAE/Americon-Mid Atlantic,
Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., GSBCA Nos. 12,294 et al., 98-2 BCA ¶ 30,084 (Oct. 23, 1998) (“the
device of comparing the as-built progress with the original planning is a worthy and time-
honored method of identifying critical delays”); see also States Roofing Corp., ASBCA No.
54,860, 10-1 BCA ¶ 34,356 (Jan. 12, 2010) (“A credible CPM time impact analysis should take
into account all of the impacts to the project.”).

        More strikingly, the District elicited no testimony from this expert on cross examination,
or testimony from the District’s single witness, that contradicted or refuted any of the expert’s
findings regarding the delay period that occurred, and the party that was responsible for the
delay. The District’s sole witness, Contracting Officer Jerry Carter, was even unable to testify as
to the basis for his conclusion that the Appellant should only be given a 90 day extension in
connection with the performance impact arising from the Change Order. Consequently, based
upon the Board’s review of the expert findings, as corroborated by the record in this case, we
also find that Appellant is entitled to compensable delay damages beyond the 90 days granted by
the District in the June 16, 2006, Contracting Officer’s Final Decision, as discussed further
below.

Actual Delay Days40

         Both the Appellant’s Expert Report and the Alpha Report (prepared on behalf of the
District prior to this litigation) treat the overall delay to the Appellant’s performance of the
contract up until February 22, 2006, as resulting from the two-block restriction imposed by the
Change Order. (FF 23, 44.) Pursuant to the District’s directive following its rescission of the
two-block restriction, the Appellant submitted Revised Schedule #3 on March 7, 2006.
However, as the expert determined based upon the as-built data, the contract was already delayed
by 140 days at the time that Civil was told to submit this revised schedule in connection with the

40
  Though we use the term “delay” in discussing the time extension that the Appellant is entitled to, we reiterate that
the Appellant’s entitlement derives from the Changes Clause.

                                                       - 19 -
                                                                             Civil Construction, LLC
                                                                CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

rescission of the two block restriction. (FF 44-45.) Therefore, as a preliminary matter, the
Appellant attributes an initial 140 day delay to the District’s Change Order requirement.

        As described herein, the District’s consultant issued the Alpha Report which rejected the
Appellant’s Revised Schedule #3 and, alternatively, asserted that the project was only delayed by
90 days, up until February 22, 2006, as the result of the Change Order. (FF 23.) This assessment
by Alpha of only a 90 delay appears to be the basis for the formal change order granting Civil a
90 day extension of time, and $204,000.00 in delay costs associated with the Change Order. (FF
25, 33.) The District, however, provided no further testimony or evidence to support the
conclusory statements in the Year 2006 Alpha Report, which appears to be the only basis for
limiting Civil’s recovery for compensable delay days arising from the Change Order. Moreover,
we find merit to the expert’s findings that the Alpha Report was flawed in that it did not adhere
to Civil’s original sequencing of work in determining the extent of the delay caused by the two-
block restriction. While the Appellant was to perform underground utility work prior to any
street-level work under its original phasing plan, the Alpha Report scheduled utility and street-
level work concurrently. (FF 4, 45.) The Appellant’s expert, on the other, reviewed the
Appellant’s Revised Schedule #3 and established a projected, remaining schedule for the project
which restored the original sequence of work activities. (See FF 45.) We, therefore, accept the
Appellant’s contention that the contract was delayed 140 days by the District by the time it was
asked to prepare a new schedule after the District rescinded the two-block restriction.

       The Alpha Report also suggested that Civil may have concurrently delayed the project,
but the District provided no further evidence or testimony at the hearing to support this claim.
(Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 17 at 182.) Because concurrent delay is in the nature of an affirmative
defense, the District bears the burden of establishing a concurrent delay. MCI Constructors, Inc.,
CAB No. D-924, 44 D.C. Reg. 6444, 6458 (June 4, 1996). The Alpha Report’s purely
speculative suggestion regarding a contractor caused delay is insufficient to establish a
concurrent delay defense. John Driggs Co., ENGBCA Nos. 4926 et al., 87-2 BCA ¶ 19,833
(May 18, 1987).

        In addition to the 140 days of delay caused by the District, and as discussed above, we
also agree with the Appellant’s expert in attributing an additional 14 days of delay to the two-
block restriction to reflect the period that the District prevented Civil from fully mobilizing on
the project by first requiring that it develop and submit Revised Schedule #3 to the District after
the two-block restriction was rescinded. (FF 46.) Despite the CO’s testimony to the contrary,
(FF 71,) a plain reading of CO’s January 19, 2006, letter rescinding the two-block restriction
shows that Civil was required to submit a revised schedule to the District before progressing
forward with work on the 1700 block of F Street. (FF 18.) Civil submitted its revised schedule
on March 7, 2006. (FF 19.) There is no allegation by the District that Civil unduly delayed in
submitting its schedule.

        The Appellant also claims 14 additional delay days due to adverse weather conditions
that occurred during the extended period that Civil was required to work on the project because
of District-caused delays. (FF 48, 50.) Where government-caused delays push a contractor into
periods of adverse weather, the contractor may recover damages for such weather delays. J.D.

Williams Constr., Inc., ASBCA No. 42,592, 92-1 BCA ¶ 24,635 (Dec. 9, 1991). We have
already found that the two-block restriction delayed the F Street Project and pushed back the
completion date until September 25, 2006. The Appellant presented evidence through its expert
establishing that it was delayed for 11 days due to adverse weather between the original May 8,
2006, completion date and the new projected completion date of September 25, 2006. (FF 48
note 15.) These weather impacts were corroborated by the daily inspector report which were
presented by the Appellant and made part of the record at trial.41 We, however, find that the
expert’s opinion that the Appellant should be granted an additional 2 days of delay for weather
because of the need to convert 4 individual weather impact days—May 15, 2006, June 12, 2006,
and July 5-6, 2006—from workdays to calendar days is unfounded. The delay period in this
matter is being calculated based upon calendar days and, thus, there is no basis for creating a
distinction, and additional recovery, to the Appellant by creating an additional conversion based
upon any of the 11 weather impact days which the Board has recognized herein as a District
caused delay. We also find that the District’s Change Order is not the proximate cause of the
November 8, 2006, weather delay as the Appellant offered no meaningful evidence that this was
the case.

         Additionally, we find that the Appellant is further entitled to an additional day of delay
resulting from the July 10, 2006, switch from the north to the south side of F Street. The
Appellant originally planned to complete all work on the north side before switching to the south
side. (FF 4.) Due to the two-block restriction, on or about September 8, 2005, Civil shifted from
the north to the south side between 23rd and 21st Streets. (FF 16.) But for the two-block
restriction, the Appellant would not have incurred the additional July 10, 2006, delay day
resulting from this switch.

        In summary, the Board finds that the Appellant is entitled to 166 compensable days of
delay resulting from the two-block restriction. We accept: (1) the Appellant’s attribution of 140
days of delay, through February 22, 2006, to the District; (2) the additional 14 days of delay
between February 22 and March 7, 2006, resulting from the schedule restriction on the Appellant
prior to commencing work on the 1700 block of F Street; (3) 11 days for the Appellant’s claim of
weather delay; and (4) the Appellant’s claim of 1 day of delay for the July 10, 2006, additional
switch from the north to south side of F Street. The Board finds that these are the only delay
days which the Appellant has proven are attributable to the actions of the District.

Delay Damages

       Equitable adjustments are corrective measures that serve to keep a contractor whole when
the District modifies a contract. Perdomo & Assocs., Inc., CAB No. D-802, 41 D.C. Reg. 3898,
3908 (Jan. 10, 1994); Grunley Constr., Inc., CAB No. D-910, 41 D.C. Reg. 3622, 3638 (Sept. 14,
1993). An equitable adjustment should reflect “the difference between what it would have
reasonably cost to perform the work as originally required and what it reasonably cost to perform
the work as changed.” District of Columbia v. Org. for Envtl. Growth, Inc., 700 A.2d 185, 203
(D.C. 1997); Gilbane-Smoot/Joint Venture, CAB No. D-885, 40 D.C. Reg. 4954, 4983 (Feb. 18,
1993). The Board has held that this requires that the contractor’s costs be reasonable; however,
the standard of reasonable costs must be viewed in light of the particular contractor’s costs.

Safety Consultants, Inc., ASBCA No. 53,485, 05-1 BCA ¶ 32,903 (Mar. 8, 2005). The
Appellant’s Amended Complaint lists 6 areas of costs. (FF 40.) We address each ad seriatim.

   a. Labor

        As discussed herein, the Appellant’s expert report and testimony established the ongoing
impact resulting from the two-block restriction mandated by the May 19, 2005, Change Order.
These facts were also corroborated by the testimony of the Appellant’s witnesses, Steve Salehi
and John Constantino. In totality, the facts confirm for the Board that the District imposed the
two-block restriction at the very start of the performance period. (FF 7-9.) The Change Order
did not change the work to be done, but it altered the way that Civil was allowed to perform the
required work. (FF 3, 5-6, 9, 11.) Rather than working on 6 blocks concurrently as planned, the
two-block restriction added inefficiencies resulting in multiple additional demobilizations. (FF
6, 11.) The expert’s report explains that the general difficulty in establishing actual labor costs
for this project arises when attempting to determine whether specific periods of labor should be
viewed as deriving from the original contract work or from the two-block restriction. (FF 53.)
In this regard, the expert report provided several reasons why Civil was unable to calculate its
actual labor costs arising from the two-block restriction, largely due to inefficiencies in the
manner in which work was performed because of the Change Order requirements. (Appellant’s
Expert Report 20.)

        In light of the lack of information on actual labor costs incurred on the project, the
Appellant’s expert prepared an estimate of the increased labor costs resulting from the delay
period. (FF 53-54.) The Appellant’s expert derived the estimate by taking the total as-bid labor
costs divided by 350 days to arrive at a daily rate, which he then multiplied by the number of
delay days that the expert found that the Appellant had incurred due to the actions of the District.
(FF 54.) The Board has previously held that the computation of daily rates is a recognized
measure of direct costs where it is impractical to derive actual cost data. MCI Constructors,
CAB No. D-924, 44 D.C. Reg. at 6462-64.

       The Board finds that the formula which the expert applied in this case to derive an
appropriate daily labor rate was acceptable given the lack of actual cost data related to additional

                                               - 22 -
                                                                                         Civil Construction, LLC
                                                                            CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

labor hours incurred by the Appellant as a result of the two-block restriction. However, the
Board finds that the expert’s use of 350 days instead of 365 days as the originally planned
contract performance period is an inaccurate baseline for the formula. In this regard, we find that
utilizing the full original contract term is a fairer measure of the Appellant’s costs. Using the
365 days originally allotted for Civil’s contract performance, we derive a burdened labor daily
rate of $1,938.57,42 which should be multiplied by the compensable delay period (166 days)
caused by the District to calculate the additional, and total, labor compensation to which Civil is
entitled to recover from the District. Accordingly, the District shall compensate the Appellant
$321,802.62 for additional labor costs incurred by the Appellant due to the Change Order.

     b. Equipment

        Similarly, based upon the delays caused by the District on this project, the expert derived
a daily rate for the Appellant’s equipment costs by using Civil’s as-bid daily equipment rate
costs as a baseline for this methodology. A contractor is entitled to recover additional equipment
costs incurred in performing work for an additional period beyond what it would have had to
perform but for a government-caused delay. MCI Constructors, CAB No. D-924, 44 D.C. Reg.
at 6464. The Appellant’s expert estimated its daily equipment rate to be $1,141.72 for the delay
period by using Civil’s as-bid daily equipment rate as the baseline for this calculation, but then
adjusting that rate to account for time during which the project equipment would be in use or
idle. (FF 56.)

        In the case of the Appellant’s project equipment, however, the Appellant introduced
evidence at the hearing that showed the actual equipment costs that it incurred for the project.
Specifically, the Appellant’s own cost accounting data shows that throughout the project Civil
incurred $591,499.00 in equipment costs and its Project Superintendent testified at the hearing
that these were, in fact, its actual equipment costs. (FF 57.) As noted above, the actual cost
method is the preferred method of proving the amount of an adjustment. Org. for Envtl. Growth,
700 A.2d at 203. The actual cost method provides the Board with a contractor’s documented
expenses and therefore ensures that the amount of an adjustment is equitable and not a windfall
for the contractor or government. Advanced Eng’g & Planning Corp., ASBCA Nos. 53366,
54044, 05-1 BCA ¶ 32,806 (Nov. 19, 2004) (citing Dawco Constr., Inc. v. United States, 930
F.2d 872, 882 (Fed. Cir. 1991)). While using estimates is an acceptable method, estimates are
generally only accepted in the absence of actual cost data. Bergman Constr. Corp., ASBCA No.
15,020, 72-1 BCA ¶ 9411 (Apr. 13, 1972) (“[E]stimates are a preferred method of pricing
equitable adjustments only where actual costs are not available.”); see also Reliable Contracting,
CBCA No. 1539, 11-2 BCA ¶ 34,882 (noting that “evidence of actual costs is more compelling
proof of damages” than estimated costs). Accordingly, actual costs should be used where
available. See Advanced Eng’g & Planning Corp., ASBCA Nos. 53366, 54044, 05-1 BCA ¶
32,806 (accepting the contractor’s estimate for a portion of its claim, but using actual cost rates
derived from a DCAA audit where such rates were provided); see also Bergman Constr. Corp.,
ASBCA No. 15,020, 72-1 BCA ¶ 9411 (rejecting both contractor and government estimates
where the estimates did not conform to the available actual cost data).


42
  We arrived at this figure by dividing the $707,576.86 in as-bid labor costs (see supra note 24) by the original 365
day duration of the project.

                                                       - 23 -
                                                                              Civil Construction, LLC
                                                                 CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

       Because actual cost data is available to establish the Appellant’s actual equipment costs,
we reject its alternative methodology for determining a daily equipment rate based upon the
Appellant’s as-bid equipment rate. We believe that the actual cost rate is the proper measure in
determining Civil’s increased equipment costs over the delay period. Consequently, in order to
derive the most accurate equipment daily rate, the Appellant’s total equipment costs
($591,499.00) must be divided by the entire 591 day duration of the project, which establishes
that Civil incurred a daily equipment cost rate of $1,000.84 for the delay period of the contract.
Therefore, the Appellant is entitled to recover from the District its equipment costs that it
incurred based upon the foregoing equipment rate of $1,000.84 as multiplied by the delay period
(166 calendar days) caused by the District on this project. As a result, the District shall
compensate the Appellant in the amount of $166,139.44 for these additional equipment costs,
which the District caused the Appellant to incur due to the Change Order.

   c. Scheduling

        The Appellant is not entitled to any additional compensation arising from scheduling
costs. The Appellant originally planned on submitting 12 schedules to the District at a cost of
$450.00.00 per schedule, or $5,400.00 total. (FF 59.) This function appears to have been
satisfied by the Appellant’s subcontractor Contractors Engineering Services, which submitted 12
invoices for scheduling services concurrent with Civil’s contract performance at a cost of
$6,790.00. (FF 58.) The fact that the Appellant may have underestimated its scheduling costs,
by not accounting for typical contract changes, cannot be a basis for shifting the resulting loss to
the District. See Org. for Envtl. Growth, 700 A.2d at 203.

        Additionally, the Appellant has not shown that the scheduling services provided by
McDonough Boyland Peck were required under the contract. Rather it appears that McDonough
was retained in order to prosecute the present appeals. McDonough was not retained until
August 2006, well into Civil’s performance under the F Street contract and after the CO’s final
decision. (FF 58.) The first invoice was for $10,000.00, a sum substantially greater than the
total amount charged by Contractors Engineering Services. (FF 58.) Moreover, McDonough
employs the Appellant’s expert. (FF 58.) Professional fees incurred in prosecuting an appeal
from a contracting officer’s final decision are not allowable costs. See MCI Constructors, CAB
No. D-924, 44 D.C. Reg. at 6469. Therefore, the Board determines that Civil may not recover
for services provided by McDonough Boyland Peck in prosecuting these appeals.

   d. Field Overhead

        Field overhead costs, also referred to a jobsite overhead or general conditions costs, are
direct costs that can be attributed to the performance of a specific contract. AMEC Constr.
Mgmt., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., GSBCA No. 16,233, 06-1 BCA ¶ 33,177 (Jan. 24, 2006);
Young Enters. of Ga., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., GSBCA No. 14,437, 00-2 BCA ¶ 31,148 (Oct.
19, 2000). We have stated that one way to measure such costs is to divide the total general
conditions costs incurred on a project by the total number of days on the project in order to
derive a daily rate, and then multiply the number of compensable days by the daily rate. MCI
Constructors, CAB No. D-924, 44 D.C. Reg. at 6464. Using this approach, the Appellant’s
expert determined that the Appellant was entitled to recover at a daily rate of $1,307.49. (FF

                                                                                           Civil Construction, LLC
                                                                              CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

61.) The Board, however, finds that a portion of the Appellant’s claim field overhead costs are
unsubstantiated and, therefore, do not support recovery at the foregoing daily rate.

        The Appellant’s expert, in calculating the field overhead rate, found that Civil had
incurred a total of $43,371.41 including field office rent cost ($31,959) and field office supplies
and phone costs ($11,412.41) for a total field office overhead cost of $43,371.41. (FF 61 note
26.) Notwithstanding, the actual company back-up cost data provided by Civil, and relied upon
by the expert, to support these field office overhead costs total an amount higher than what the
expert included in the expert report for these same costs items ($44,165.50). (FF 62.) The
expert acknowledged this cost discrepancy between his expert report and Civil’s internal back-up
data, but never explained or reconciled these differing costs so that his report could be fully
substantiated on this issue at the hearing:

         And if I look at Page 3 of the Job Cost Detailed Transaction Report, the total
         shows $44,165.50 which is a little bit more than the $43,371.41 shown in my
         report. So, presumably there are things in here that were not included in my
         calculation.

(Hr’g Tr. 475:12-17)

Thus, given the Appellant’s failure to clarify the discrepancy between its internal cost records
and the ultimate amount set forth in the expert report for its field office overhead costs in the
amount of $43,371.41, the Appellant failed to meet its burden of showing the accuracy of these
particular costs, which it allegedly incurred.

          In order to substantiate its extended field overhead costs, the Appellant also provided the
Board with evidence of the payroll costs for project supervision which it incurred for the F Street
Project in the amount of $580,457.60, as well as its costs for a field safety officer in the amount
of $27,338.11. (FF 62.) The Appellant’s Chief Financial Officer provided extensive testimony
to explain the basis for these payroll calculations and the total of $607,795.71, which it incurred
in field safety officer and field supervision costs, which the Board accepts as valid.43 (FF 62.)
The Board, however, finds that the 20 percent markup, which the Appellant’s expert applied to
these field safety officer and supervision costs is unallowable as it would improperly result in
double recovery to the Appellant based upon the separate overhead recovery being granted to the
Appellant below. Dividing the $607,795.71 in field supervision costs by the 591 days of total
duration of the F Street Project, we find that the Appellant is entitled to recover from the District
its field overhead costs at a daily rate of $1,028.42, which should be multiplied by the 166 days
attributable to the District to calculate the total field overhead costs, for which the Appellant is
entitled to be compensated by the District. Consequently, the District shall compensate the
Appellant in the amount of $170,717.72 for these additional field overhead costs, which the
District caused the Appellant to incur due to the Change Order.


43
   While the Appellant did not formally introduce its payroll summary document (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 35) into
evidence at the hearing, it was clearly its intention to do so. Moreover, prior to allowing Appellant’s Chief Financial
Officer to testify regarding the substance of this document, the Board heard and overruled the District’s objections
to this document being introduced and relied upon by the Appellant at the hearing for purposes of meeting its burden
of proof. (Hr’g Tr. 310:17-322:19) For these reasons, the Board hereby admits the document into the record.

   e. Extended Home Office Overhead

       1. The Notice Requirement of the Changes Clause Does Not Preclude the Appellant
          from Recovering Extended Home Office Overhead

        The Appellant’s claims in D-1413 and D-1417 seek recovery of its home office overhead
costs during the extended performance period. (FF 37-38.) The District argues that the
Appellant should be barred from recovery because the claims were submitted more than 5 years
after the May 19, 2005, Change Order was issued and therefore the Appellant violated the notice
requirement of the changes clause. (Dist. Post Hr’g Br. 19-20.)

        It is well settled in government contract law that notice provisions are read liberally and
will not bar a contractor’s claim unless the government is prejudiced by the late notice. See, e.g.,
Walsh/Davis Joint Venture v. Gen. Servs. Admin., CBCA No. 1460, 11-1 BCA ¶ 34,737 (Apr.
11, 2011); Flathead Contractors, LLC, AGBCA Nos. 2005-130-1, 2005-131-1, 06-1 BCA ¶
33,174 (Jan. 18, 2006); Grumman Aerospace Corp., ASBCA Nos. 48,006 et al., 03-1 BCA ¶
32,203 (Mar. 14, 2003); Powers Regulatory Co., GSBCA Nos. 4468 et al., 80-2 BCA ¶ 14,463
(Apr. 30, 1980). The government bears the burden of establishing that it was prejudiced; this
burden cannot be met by mere allegation but must be supported by evidence in the record.
Grumman Aerospace, ASBCA Nos. 48,006 et al., 03-1 BCA ¶ 32,203; see also Walsh/Davis,
CBCA No. 1460, 11-1 BCA ¶ 34,737 (“the claim will be heard unless the Government can prove
it was prejudiced by the late notice”); Big Chief Drilling Co. v. United States, 15 Cl. Ct. 295, 303
(1988) (“the government has the burden of proving that the untimeliness caused prejudice to its
case”). This Board has adopted this federal standard regarding the interpretation of notice
requirements. Org. for Envtl. Growth, CAB No. D-850, 49 D.C. Reg. 3353, 3354 (Apr. 13,
2001), rev’d on other grounds, 806 A.2d 1225 (D.C. 2002).

        In the seminal case of Hoel-Steffen Construction Co. v. United States, the Court of
Claims stated that to adopt a “severe and narrow application of the notice requirements … would
be out of tune with the language and purpose of the notice provisions, as well as [a] concern that
notice provisions … not be applied too technically and illiberally where the Government is quite
aware of the operative facts.” 456 F.2d 760, 767-68 (1972). Accordingly, the government can
be placed on notice where the contracting officer has actual or imputed knowledge of the
pertinent facts. See CATH-dr/Balti Joint Venture, ASBCA Nos. 53,581, 54,239, 05-2 BCA ¶
33,046 (Aug. 17, 2005); A.R. Mack Constr. Co., ASBCA No. 50,035, 01-2 BCA ¶ 31,593 (Sept.
18, 2001).

         The Board finds that the District was on notice of the Appellant’s claims in two ways.
First, soon after the Appellant had placed concrete barriers along the entire six blocks of the F
Street Project, the neighboring community began objecting to the anticipated disruption the
construction would cause. (FF 8-9.) In response to the complaints, the CO imposed the two-
block restriction, specifically citing the Changes Clause. (FF 9.) Therefore, the District knew
(or at least should have known) that it was altering the Appellant’s sequence of work, which
could give rise to a claim. Indeed, within five days of the CO’s imposition of the two-block
restriction, the Appellant furnished the CO with written notice that the change would materially
alter the nature of the project and drastically increase costs and requested a formal change order
to reflect the additional costs. (FF 10.) This notice was followed by a July 15, 2005, estimate of

                                               - 26 -
                                                                                      Civil Construction, LLC
                                                                         CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

costs arising from the two-block restriction, in which the Appellant estimated that direct costs
would increase by $2,375,275.18. (FF 12-13.) Though the Appellant stated that extended home
office costs were not included in the estimate, (FF 13,) the Appellant did not waive its right to
recover those costs.

        Further, assuming arguendo that the Appellant was required to specifically notify the
District that it was seeking extended home office overhead costs, the District has not alleged,
much less shown, any prejudice. In the formal modification issued three days after his final
decision, the CO stated that the $204,000.00 in additional compensation included unabsorbed
home office costs. (FF 34.) At the hearing, the CO reiterated that the $204,000.00 he awarded
to the Appellant included extended overhead costs. (FF 72.) Absent any prejudice to the
District, the Appellant is not precluded from asserting its claims for extended overhead costs in
this action.

        2. The Eichleay Formula is Not the Appropriate Method of Determining the Appellant’s
           Recoverable Extended Overhead Costs

       The Appellant seeks to recover its unabsorbed home office overhead costs for the
extended project period pursuant to the Eichleay formula. (FF 37-38, 63.) The Eichleay formula
was first introduced by the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals in Eichleay Corp.,
ASBCA No. 5,183, 60-2 BCA ¶ 2,688 (July 29, 1960). The Eichleay formula allocates overhead
costs “pro-rata because they cannot ordinarily be charged to a particular contract.” Wickham
Contracting Co. v. Fischer, 12 F.3d 1574, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (citing Eichleay Corp., ASBCA
No. 5,183, 60-2 BCA ¶ 2,688) (quotation marks omitted). Use of the Eichleay formula is
appropriate where a government caused-delay has “reduced the stream of direct costs in a
contract.” C.B.C. Enters., Inc. v. United States, 978 F.2d 669, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1992).

        However, the Eichleay formula does not automatically apply to all claims for unabsorbed
or extended home office overhead costs. Rather, both the Board and the Federal Circuit have
held that a contractor must satisfy certain prerequisites before the Eichleay formula may be
applied. See, e.g., MCI Constructors, Inc., CAB No. D-924, 44 D.C. Reg. 6444; Melka Marine,
Inc. v. United States, 187 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 1999); P.J. Dick, Inc. v. Principi, 324 F.3d 1364
(Fed. Cir. 2003). For example, in MCI Constructors, the Board held that in order to justify using
the Eichleay formula for calculating its daily rate of unabsorbed home office expenses, a
contractor must show that: “(1) the government has caused a compensable delay or suspension;
(2) the delay or suspension interrupts or reduces the stream of income from payments for
contract direct costs; and (3) it was unable to absorb a fair share of its home office overhead
costs during the delay or suspension period.”44 MCI Constructors, CAB No. D-924, 44 D.C.
Reg. 6444 at 6456. Similarly, the Federal Circuit has held that calculating extended home office
overhead costs using a daily rate, pursuant to the Eichleay formula, is an “extraordinary remedy
which is specifically limited to contracts affected by government caused suspensions, disruptions
and delays of work.” C.B.C. Enters., 978 F.2d at 675.


44
   The Board notes, however, that, in the past, it has not consistently analyzed whether the above (or similar
elements) have been met before applying the Eichleay formula to calculate a contractor’s unabsorbed home office
costs. See, e.g., Prince Constr. Co., Inc., CAB No. D-1127, 50 D.C. Reg. 7498 (May 12, 2003); A.A. Beiro Constr.
Co., CAB No. D-822, 50 D.C. Reg. 7349 (Jan. 3, 2002).

                                                                          CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

        In the years since MCI Constructors, the Federal Circuit has held that, “before using the
Eichleay formula to quantify damages,” the contractor must meet three prerequisites.45 Nicon,
Inc. v. United States, 331 F.3d 878, 883 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (emphasis added). First, the contractor
must show that there was a government-caused delay of uncertain duration. Id.; Melka Marine,
187 F.3d at 1375. Second, the contractor must also show that the delay extended the time of
performance (or alternatively that it incurred additional costs because it would have completed
its performance earlier). P.J. Dick, 324 F.3d at 1370. Third, the contractor must show that it
was required to remain on standby, and thus unable to take on additional work to mitigate
damages. Melka Marine, 187 F.3d at 1375; Interstate Gen. Gov’t Contractors, Inc. v. West, 12
F.3d 1053, 1056 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Where the contractor makes a prima facie showing that it
meets these prerequisites the burden of production shifts to the government to show that “it was
not impractical for the contractor to take on replacement work.” P.J. Dick, 324 F.3d at 1370;
Melka Marine, 187 F.2d at 1375.

        Although neither party questions the propriety of using the Eichleay formula, the Board
finds it inappropriate to use the Eichleay formula to calculate the Appellant’s recoverable
overhead costs. Specifically, the Appellant fails to meet the third prerequisite for using the
Eichleay formula—that is, the standby prong. The Federal Circuit has stated that the standby
prong, properly understood, focuses on “suspension of work on the contract.” Interstate Gen.,
12 F.3d at 1057. Here, the record shows that while work was delayed due to the Change Order,
it does not show that the Appellant was forced to suspend performance.46 In addition, the
Appellant has not alleged that it was required to standby for any indefinite extended period of
time as a result of the District’s May 19, 2005, Change Order. Rather, the Appellant asserts that
at no point did it stop work on the contract. (FF 27.) When a contractor continues to perform a
substantial amount of work on a contract, the contractor is not on standby and use of the Eichleay
formula is improper. P.J. Dick, 324 F.3d at 1373-74. Accordingly, use of the Eichleay formula
here is inappropriate.

       The Eichleay formula is simply a method of allocating overhead costs and is not a matter
of legal entitlement. Nicon, 331 F.3d at 889 (Newman, J., concurring); see also id. at 883
(discussing the use of the Eichleay formula to quantify damages). Where a contractor meets the
Eichleay prerequisites, the Eichleay formula is the exclusive method for calculating extended
home office overhead costs.47 Young Enters., GSBCA No. 14,437, 00-2 BCA ¶ 31,148 (citing
Melka Marine, 187 F.3d. at 1374-75; Wickham Contracting, 12 F.3d at 1574). But, where
contract changes do not require a contractor to suspend work, the contractor may recover a fixed
percentage markup of direct costs incurred. Cmty. Heating & Plumbing Co. v. Kelso, 987 F.2d
1575, 1581-82 (Fed. Cir. 1993).
45
   This number has varied somewhat between cases, though there is broad agreement as to the particulars. For
example, P.J. Dick, supra, expands the three elements to four, while Melka Marine, supra, compresses the analysis
to a mere two elements.
46
   On the contrary, Appellant worked on duct banks for both GWU and GSA concurrently with portions of the F
Street Project. (FF 28-29)
47
   The language of some Federal Circuit decisions suggests greater exclusivity in using the Eichleay formula. See,
e.g., Melka Marine, 187 F.3d at 1374-75 (“The Eichleay formula is the only means approved in our case law for
calculating recovery of unabsorbed home office overhead.”); Wickham Contracting., 12 F.3d at 1575 (the Eichleay
formula “is the only proper method of calculating unabsorbed home office overhead. No other formula may be
used.”). We note, however, that this language is to be read “in light of the factual context in which they arose.”
Nicon, 331 F.3d at 884.

                                                                          CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

        While we have used the term “delay” as a term of convenience throughout this opinion,
the Appellant’s entitlement to additional costs derives from the Changes Clause of the contract;
and our granting the Appellant an additional 166 days is a pure contract extension. With regard
to pure contract extensions, use of a percentage markup to calculate recoverable overhead costs
is appropriate.48, 49 See Cmty. Heating & Plumbing, 987 F.2d at 1582; Program & Constr.
Mgmt. Grp., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., GSBCA No. 14,149, 99-2 BCA ¶ 30,579 (Sept. 30,
1999) (citing C.B.C. Enters., 978 F.2d 669), aff’d on reconsideration, 00-1 BCA ¶ 30,771 (Jan.
27, 2000). Therefore, we grant the Appellant’s entitlement to also recover a reasonable
percentage markup on its direct costs, as recoverable overhead, and remand the issue of quantum
for these overhead costs to the parties to negotiate a reasonable fixed percentage markup formula
according to which the Appellant shall be compensated by the District.

          Subcontractor Claims

        1. Central Armature Works Has Failed to Demonstrate Its Claimed Costs

        The Appellant has failed to prove the amount to which it is entitled in regard to the
Appellant’s claim on behalf of Central Armature. The Appellant seeks $15,696.85 in recovery,
which is a downward adjustment from $19,215.11, consistent with Appellant’s days of delay.
(FF 64.) This $19,215.11 figure is, in turn, a downward adjustment from Central Armature’s
original $101,582.00 July 6, 2005, estimate. (FF 65.) During its testimony, Central Armature
was unable to provide the Board with details on how any of these amounts were calculated or
what cost factors were included in these calculations. For this reason, the Board finds that the
Appellant’s claim for costs on behalf of Central Armature are unsubstantiated and cannot be a
basis for recovery in this matter.

        2. The District is Not the Cause of Fort Myer’s Claimed Costs.

        With regard to the Appellant’s claim on behalf of Fort Myers, the Board notes that the
Appellant did not enter into its subcontract with Fort Myer until August 12, 2005, almost three
months after the District’s May 19, 2005, Change Order, yet it did not incorporate the Change
Order into this subcontract. (FF 15.) Information pertaining to the Change Order was available
to Fort Myer before it executed its subcontract agreement with the Appellant so as to put it on
notice that the Contract had been modified to include a two-block restriction on construction
work. Nonetheless, Fort Myer’s inexplicably appears to have negotiated subcontractor rates with
the Appellant based upon a minimal number of mobilizations and demobilizations that obviously
did not account for the Change Order that was issued by the District several months earlier.

48
   In at least one previous decision, the Board has allowed a contractor to recover overhead costs of 10%, using a
fixed percentage markup of direct costs. See A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., Inc. CAB No. D-822, 40 D.C. Reg. 4574 (Oct.
15, 1992) (granting appellant a 10% fixed markup for overhead). Similarly, the ASBCA has allowed home office
overhead costs ranging from 5.87 to 12.3%. See, e.g., Fru-Con Constr. Corp., ASBCA No. 55197, 07-2 BCA ¶
33,197 (October 4, 2007) (upholding a home office overhead rate of 5.87% as reasonable on appeal); C.E.R., Inc.,
ASBCA No. 41767, 96-1 BCA ¶ 28,029 (October 30, 1995) (finding that a 10% fixed overhead markup was more
appropriate for calculating extended overhead costs than the Eichleay formula); Haskell Corp., ASBCA Nos. 54262,
54263, 06-2 BCA ¶ 33,422 (October 19, 2006) (granting home office costs of 12.3%).
49
   Here, the Appellant’s requested Eichleay overhead costs of $205,523.58 represent approximately 19.9% of
Appellant’s total requested adjustment of $1,033,014.61. (FF 40.) However, the addition of $205,523.58 in home
office overhead to the $658,659.78 already granted by the Board would represent a markup of approximately 31.2%.

                                                      - 29 -
                                                                            Civil Construction, LLC
                                                               CAB Nos. D-1294, D-1413, and D-1417

Thus, the Board finds that it was the failure of Fort Myer and the Appellant to negotiate and
execute a subcontract based upon the revised contract terms that resulted in any alleged
additional costs claimed by Fort Myer from additional mobilizations/demobilizations as opposed
to the actions of the District in issuing the Change Order.

         Additionally, the Board denies Fort Myer’s claim because Fort Myer failed to prove its
costs. Fort Myer provided unit pricing for its subcontract, which incorporated the costs of
mobilizations. (FF 15.) However, Fort Myer’s August 23, 2007, Request for Equitable
Adjustment sought to recover the costs for additional mobilizations, as well as other costs. (FF
36, 67-68.) At the hearing, Fort Myer attempted to substantially increase its costs through
calculations performed on the witness stand, purportedly on the basis of newly audited costs.
(FF 69-70.) However, Fort Myer did not provide the detailed underlying cost data to sufficiently
verify its most current estimates, nor did Fort Myer provide testimony to prove the accuracy of
its allegedly audited costs to meet its burden of proof. Accordingly, we deny Fort Myer’s claim.

                                        CONCLUSION

        The record in this matter unequivocally establishes that, at the outset of the F Street
Project, the District issued a Change Order that significantly altered the manner and sequence in
which the Appellant was able to perform the contract work, as compared to the original contract
requirements. The District’s Change Order delayed the project by 166 days. The Change Order
also caused damages to the Appellant beyond what the District had previously granted and paid
to the Appellant in connection with the Change Order. Consequently, the District is hereby
ordered to compensate the Appellant in the amount of $658,659.78 for Appellant’s additional
labor, equipment, and field overhead costs. This amount shall be used as the basis for the
parties’ negotiation of Appellant’s extended home office overhead costs, which shall be
calculated as a reasonable percentage markup to the above amount. The District may then
deduct any damage amount previously paid to the Appellant in connection with the Change
Order in calculating the remaining damage amount still owed to the Appellant pursuant to this
Order. The District shall also pay the Appellant interest, in accordance with D.C. CODE § 2-
359.09 (2011) (formerly D.C. CODE § 2-308.06), on any outstanding amounts required to be paid
to the Appellant in connection with this award of damages by the Board.
