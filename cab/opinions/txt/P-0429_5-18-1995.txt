                                           OPINION

        Dixon's Termite & Pest Control, Inc., protests the District of Columbia Public School's
("DCPS") award of Contract No. 040-AA-67-0-5-ML (termite control services) to Federal Pest
Control, Inc. DCPS has moved to dismiss the protest before the Board because Dixon failed
to exhaust its administrative protest remedy at DCPS. We agree and dismiss Dixon's protest
for failure to exhaust its DCPS administrative remedies.

                                            FACTS

         On October 28, 1994, DCPS issued IFB No. 040-AA-67-0-5-ML for termite control
services for school facilities. The IPB was for a multiple award contract. On January 10, 1995,
DCPS made awards to the only two bidders, Dixon Termite & Pest Control and Federal Pest
Control. By letter dated January 20, 1995, Dixon filed a protest with the DCPS Procurement
Officer challenging the award to Federal Pest based on certain alleged bid deficiencies. Dixon
also filed a copy of th i~ January 20 protest letter with the Board, which was received on January
23, 1995. The agency-level protest was resolved by a DCPS Procurement Officer who issued
a decision on February 23, 1995, denying the protest. (Agency's Motion to Dismiss Protest,
Attachment). The February 23 decision notified the protester that it had the right to appeal this
                                                                                     II

decision to the Superintendent of Schools within (10) working days from receipt of this letter. II


(ld.) The protester did not request Superintendent review of the February 23 decision. On
March 16, 1995, DCPS filed with the Board its motion to dismiss the protest pending before the
Board based on the protester's failure to exhaust its DCPS protest remedy. The protester did
not respond to the motion. On April 28, 1995, the Board held a telephone conference with the
parties. The protester stated that although it did not think that Federal Pest Control's bid was
                                                                                                   [7007]

in accordance with the solicitation requirements, it was not intending to pursue the protest. I

                                         DISCUSSION

        DCPS is an independent District agency. Pursuant to statute, the Board of Education is
authorized to enter into negotiations and binding contracts pursuant to rules and regulations
adopted by the Board of Education. D.C. Code § 31-1535(b) (1981). This statutory provision
requires that procurement rules or regulations be adopted by the Board of Education in accord
with the public notice and participation requirements of D.C. Code § 1-1506 (1992) and be
consistent with policies embodied in District-wide contracting and procurement rules and
regulations. The Board of Education has issued procurement regulations which can be found
in 5 DCMR Chapter 37 (1991). Under subpart 3714 of these regulations, entitled "Protests",
an aggrieved party must file a written protest with the DCPS procurement officer within 10 days
after the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the facts giving rise to the protest, id.
§ 3714.2, and the procurement officer must render a decision within 10 days of receipt of the
protest. If the protester is not satisfied with the decision, it may seek review by the
Superintendent of Schools. Id. §§ 3714.4, 3713.4. The decision of the Superintendent is final
and conclusive unless , within 30 days of receipt of the Superintendent's decision, the protester
"files a written appeal to the D.C. Contract Appeals Board." lei. § 3713.6. See Shannon &
LIiChs, CAB No. P-415, Sept. 21, 1994,7 P.D. 5971, 5977 n.W.

        In the present case, the protester did not seek Superintendent review of the procurement
officer's decision and has indicated that it does not intend to pursue the matter. Because the
DCPS regulations require a protester to seek review by the Superintendent of a procurement
officer's decision prior to seeking review at this Board, and such a regulatory scheme does not
contradict the policies of the District-wide procurement rules and regulations, we dismiss the
protest for failure to exhaust DCPS administrative remedies. See Bufford v. D. C. Public
Schools, 611 A.2d 519, 523-25 (D.C. 1992); District of Columbia v. Group Insurance
Administration, 633 A.2d 2, 20-21 (D.C. 1993).

       Accordingly, the protest is dismissed.




DATE: May 8. 1995                                            !J.

1  During the conference call, the Board briefly discussed the issues raised by the protest
regarding minor deviations in Federal Pest Control's bid which were resolved or waived by
DCPS prior to award to Federal Pest Control. Because we dismiss for failure to exhaust
administrative remedies, we offer no opinion on one issue that appears to concern post-bid unit
price negotiations. See 5 DCMR § 3704.2.
