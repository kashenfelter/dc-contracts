                                             OPINION
                                           Filing ID 35481274


        On July 13, 2010, Our Future, Inc., (“Our Future”) protested the District’s Child and Family
Services Agency’s (“CFSA”) determination that Our Future was not a responsible bidder for the
above solicitation. The protester alleged that CFSA did not follow the same rules and procedures to
determine whether companies competing for the contract had materials needed and qualified staff to
conduct the home-based and community based tutoring services set forth in the solicitation. Our
Future alleges that CFSA did not revisit Our Future’s offices after the initial visit, and did not give
Our Future a chance to re-schedule the appointment. The District responded in its Motion to
Dismiss, or, in the alternative, Agency Report, that Our Future failed to file its protest within 10
business days after it knew or should have known of the grounds of its protest, as required by D.C.
Code § 2-309.08, and, in any event, that the District had properly determined that Our Future was
not a responsible bidder, and that the District had not acted in bad faith in finding Our Future
nonresponsible.

                                         BACKGROUND

        On December 9, 2009, CFSA issued IFB CFSA-09-I-0004 for an indefinite delivery
indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contract to provide home based and community based supplemental
educational services, tutoring, and remediation services in individual sessions or group settings to
wards (students) of the District of Columbia in the care, custody and control of CFSA. The IFB
contemplated award of an IDIQ contract with fixed unit hourly prices. (AR Ex. 2). CFSA received
20 bids by December 29, 2009. (AR Ex. 1 and 3).

        CFSA made several attempts to conduct site visits with Our Future. (AR Ex. 3) Once the
District made contact with Our Future, District representatives went to Our Future’s facility at 1629
K Street, NE. The receptionists at that location stated that there was no one available from Our
Future. The CFSA representative telephoned Our Future, but representatives from Our Future did
not appear to conduct a site visit. Additionally, CFSA could not review staff records to verify
educational requirements of Our Futures staff, as required by Section C.9 of the solicitation. The
                                                  -2-                        Our Future, Inc. CAB No. P-0860



inspection team could not recommend continuing a business relationship with Our Future. (AR Ex.
4).

        CFSA determined that Our Future was not a responsible bidder. (AR Ex. 3). CFSA also
determined that four other bidders were not responsible. By letter dated June 17, 2010, CFSA
notified Our Future that CFSA would not award a contract to Our Future. (AR Ex. 5). Our Future
filed this protest on July 13, 2010.

                                            DISCUSSION

        We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03(a)(1).

         Our Future asserts that the District improperly determined that the protester was not a
responsible bidder, and that the District did not give Our Future a second opportunity for a site visit.
 The District responds that it could not determine that Our Future was responsible, and that without
an affirmative determination of responsibility, the District could not award a contract to Our Future.
 The District also asserts that Our Future filed its protest after the protest period set forth in the
statute.

        We begin by addressing the issue of whether Our Future timely filed its protest. The District
asserts that Our Future filed its protest more than 10 business days after June 17, 2010, the date the
contracting officer notified Our Future by letter that its bid had been rejected as non-responsible.
(AR Ex. 5). The District asserts that because Our Future knew that the District had rejected Our
Future’s bid on June 17, 2010, Our Future should have filed its protest within 10 business days of
that date, that is, by July 2, 2010. See Sigal Construction Corp., CAB No. P-0690, et al., Nov. 24,
2004, 52 D.C. Reg. 4243, 4253-54; Professional Recruiters, Inc., CAB No. P-0700, Dec. 21, 2004,
52 D.C. Reg. 4258, 4259-60.

        D.C. Code § 2-309.08 (b)(2) requires the protester to file a protest not later than 10 business
days after the basis of the protest is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier. Our
Future does not challenge the District’s assertion that it informed Our Future of the bid rejection on
June 17, 2010. Our Future asserts that it did not receive official notification of the details of the bid
rejection until June 29, 2010, and that it filed its protest within ten days of that date. In making that
assertion, Our Future asks the Board to ignore the letter dated June 17, 2010, signed by Tara
Sigamoni, contracting officer, who personally informed Our Future that its bid had been rejected as
nonresponsible. (AR. Ex. 5) Because Our Future failed to submit its protest within 10 business days
after June 17, 2010, its protest is untimely. Accordingly, we dismiss the protest. Additionally, we
see no need to address the responsibility issues raised by the District.

                                               CONCLUSION
        For the reasons discussed above, we dismiss Our Future’s protest.
