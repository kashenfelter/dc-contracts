      Opinion by Administrative Judge Davis with Administrative Judge Booker

                                     DISCUSSION

       On November 18, 1988, the Board sustained a protest filed by Pinnacle
Corporation (Pinnacle) against a solicitation issued by the D.C. Department of Public
Works.?' In our decision we found, inter alia, that the conduct of the District in failing
to adequately state its new policy concerning roofing experience requirements for
contractors, and its application of that policy to Pinnacle, was unreasonable and,
therefore, arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of § 1-1189.8(c)(2) of the D.C.


 !l'fbe panel designated to hear and decide this matter consisted of Judges Davis,
Booker and Sharpe. During the deliberation stage of this matter, Judge Sharpe, whose
participation in this case is pursuant to the authority contained in the D.C. Procurement
Practices Act of 1985, D.C. Code, §1-1189.2(cH2)(1987 Replacement), took ill and was
unable to continue.


  ?'Pinnacle Corporation (D.C. CAB, Nov. 18, 1988) 36 D.C. 3965, June 2, 1989. This
case originated during the period when the District of Columbia Contract Appeals Board
was functioning pursuant to Commissioner's Order No.9, D.C. Code, Supplement V
(1987), as amended by Mayor's Order 86-65, 33 DCR 3006 (May 16, 1986). Pursuant to
the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985, D.C. Code, § 1-1189.1 (1987), a new
independent agency denominated as the Contract Appeals Board was created. This new
Board became operational on August 1, 1988, and succeeded to the jurisdiction of all
cases pending before the previously established Board.

Procurement Practices Act of 1985 (PPA).~ Based on the Board's opinion, Pinnacle, on
December 22, 1988, filed a claim for bid preparation costs.

       The District opposes the amount Pinnacle has claimed for bid preparation costs
and argues that (1) the bid preparation costs claimed are inadequately documented, and
(2) the claim is not presented in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting
principles. The District acknowledges, however, that the PPA and its implementing
regulations do not address the issue of what level of proof the Board needs in order to
determine the amount of bid preparation costs which may be awarded to a successful
protester; and it urges the Board to adopt standards articulated in Chapter 33, Title 27,
District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (27 DCMR), as the guiding principle for
determining whether a protester's bid costs submission is sufficient.

       In addition, the District proffers for the Board's consideration its own estimate of
what Pinnacle's costs should have been to prepare the bid. That estimate, $2,896.00, is
the work product of one Joseph F. Murphy, an engineering technical estimator employed
by the Department of Public Works. [See Affidavit of Joseph Murphy, attachment No.2
to the District's motion in opposition to Pinnacle's claim for bid preparation cost.]

      The Board rejects the District's suggestion that the contract cost principles set out
in Chapter 33, 27 DCMR, be applied in this case for the reasons hereinafter stated.

       It is clear to this Board that in enacting § 1-1189.8(c)(2), the Council of the
District of Columbia intended that bid or proposal preparation costs constitute a form of
damages to the protester for monetary loss caused by the arbitrary and capricious action
of District officials. The District appears to suggest that the extent of these damages be
quantified to a mathematical certainty. We note however that the District, for reasons
best known to it, failed to seek any discovery from Pinnacle concerning their cost.

       We believe it would be manifestly unjust to deny relief, where governmental
responsibility for damages is clear, simply because the damages claimed cannot be
measured with exactness and precision. The ascertainment of damages is not an exact
science and the lack of certainty as to the amount of damages does not preclude
recovery. J.D. Hedin Construction Co. v. United States, 171 Ct.CI. 70, 347 F.2d 235
(1961). All that we require in a claim for bid preparation costs, where responsibility for
damage is clear, is that the evidence adduced be sufficient to enable us to make a fair
and reasonable approximation. Specialty Assembling & Packing Co. v. United States,


 ~Section    1-1189.8(c)(2) reads as follows: "The Board may, when requested, award
reasonable bid or proposal preparation costs not including legal fees, if it finds that the
District government actions toward the protester or claimant were arbitrary and
capricious."

                                       DECISION

      The protester's motion is granted. The protester is awarded $6,785.91 as bid
preparation costs. The facts of this case fully justify the open-minded approach with
regard to the burden of proof that we have taken, and we remain satisfied that the result
we have reached represents a fair and reasonable approximation of the protester's costs.

  ~e     protester's costs have been calculated by taking the hourly rate of pay for each
 individual involved in the bid preparation process and multiplying those rates by the
 number of hours worked, to which has been added a payroll tax rate of 11.41%, and a
 22% factor for workmen's compensation, for a total personnel cost of $5,778.23. A bid
 bond premium of $2,148.48 plus an overhead rate of 19.07% result in a total bid
 preparation claim of $9,438.27. The vice president of Pinnacle Corporation has certified
 to the validity of these costs.
