        For the Appellant: Heather L. Levin, Esq .. For the District of Columbia Housing Authority:
Patricia Gracyalny, Esq.

       Opinion by Administrative Judge Jonathan D. Zischkau, with Administrative Judges Phyllis
W. Jackson and Matthew S. Watson, concurring.

                                             OPINION

        Curtis Chevrolet filed a claim for interest penalties pursuant to the Quick Payment Act, as
amended, D.C. Code §§ 1-1171 to 1-1176 (1999), for late payments made by the District of
Columbia Housing Authority ("DCHA") on 29 separate invoices. Curtis Chevrolet has moved for
summary judgment. DCHA opposes summary judgment on the ground that the purchase orders
contain no clause making the Quick Payment Act applicable to the contract. We conclude that Quick
Payment Act interest is mandated by the statute itself and thus the lack of a contract clause is no
valid defense. DCHA does not dispute that Curtis Chevrolet performed the services required by the
contract, submitted proper invoices, and was paid late on those invoices. Having resolved the single
legal issue against DCHA, we grant Sllmmary judgment on Curtis Chevrolet's claim in the
undisputed amount of $8,090.93.

                                         BACKGROUND

       Curtis Chevrolet and DCHA entered into Contract No. 8062-98-HD for the purchase of
various vehicles. Neither party has included the contract in the record. DCHA has submitted
purchase orders issued under the contract, each containing a page entitled "Instructions to Vendors"
which states with respect to invoices:

       Payments will be processed when all deliveries under this order have been made
       and/or services rendered. . .. Render invoices or billings showing the Purchase
       Order Number to the location shown on the face of this form. . .. In cases where
       partial payments are authorized, the invoice or billing should clearly indicat~partial
       payment request."

(DCHA Opposition, Ex. 1). The "Instructions to Vendors" addresses invoices, delivery charges, and
taxes, but does not set forth the contractual payment terms. Although tpe parties agree that the
contract did not specify a particular date by which invoices had to be paid (Curtis Chevrolet Reply, at
2; DCHA Opposition, at 2), the Quick Payment Act establishes that the required payment due date is
                          •                      -2-
                                                                     •    Curtis Chevrolet, CAB No. D-1116
                                                                                                             [8118]




"30 calendar days, excluding legal holidays, after receipt of a proper invoice for the amount of the
payment due, if a specific date on which payment is due is not established by contract." D.C. Code §
1-1172(a)(1)(A).

       It is undisputed that Curtis Chevrolet performed the services contracted for by DCHA, that
the 29 invoices submitted by Curtis Chevrolet were in proper form, and that DCHA paid these
invoices from 21 days to 87 days beyond the 30-day payment due date. (DCHA Opposition, at 2;
Curtis Chevrolet Summary Judgment Motion, Exs. 1-3).

        On November 5, 1999, Curtis Chevrolet filed a claim for interest penalties under the Quick
Payment Act. On July 19,2000, Curtis Chevrolet filed an amended claim, revising the claim amount
from $13,217.87 to $8,090.93, and its motion for summary judgment. On August 9,2000, DCHA
filed an answer to the claim as amended and an opposition to the summary judgment motion.

                                           DISCUSSION

       We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1174.

        DCHA's only defense to the Quick Payment Act claim is that the purchase orders issued
under the contract did not contain a clause authorizing Quick Payment Act interest. We hold that the
absence of such a clause does not excuse DCHA from paying Quick Payment Act interest.

        By virtue of the Procurement Reform Amendment Act of 1996, D.C. Law 11-259,44 D.C.
Reg. 1423 (Mar. 14, 1997), the Quick Payment Act's definition of "District agency" was expanded to
include independent agencies and any agency of government not subject to the administrative control
ofthe Mayor. D.C. Law 11-259, § 307(a), codified at D.C. Code § 1-1171(3) (1999). Hood's Int'l
Foods, Inc., CAB No. D-996, Feb. 20,1998,45 D.C. Reg. 8742, 8743 & n.2. As section 1-1171(3)
demonstrates, the Council intended that the Quick Payment Act have broader application than even
the Procurement Practices Act. The Procurement Reform Amendment Act made DCHA subject to
both the Quick Payment Act and the Procurement Practices Act. DCHA was obligated to pay Quick
Payment Act interest by the terms of the Quick Payment Act notwithstanding the presence or
absence ofa clause in the contract authorizing interest penalties for late payment. D.C. Code §§ 1-
1172, 1173. DCHA argues that a Quick Payment Act clause should not be incorporated into the
contract by operation of law under the Christian doctrine because the Act does not further a major
government principle. See G.L. Christian & Assocs. v. United States, 312 F.2d 418 (Ct. Cl.), cert
denied, 375 U.S. 954 (1963). Clearly, the Christian doctrine would apply to Quick Payment Act
interest, D.C. Code § 1-1172(b )(1 A), but the doctrine is unnecessary here since the obligation arises
directly from the statute and its implementing regulations found at 1 DCMR Chapter 17.

                                          CONCLUSION

       Because the facts are undisputed, the matter is appropriate for summary judgment. We
conclude that the Quick Payment Act applies to the Curtis Chevrolet's contract with DCHA
                        •                    -3-
                                                                •   Curtis Chevrolet, CAB No. D-1116
                                                                                                       [8119]




regardless of whether the contract contains a Quick Payment Act clause. Accordingly, we sustain
Curtis Chevrolet's claim in the undisputed amount of $8,090.93.
