                                                                           ) CAB Nos. D-863 and D-864

       For the Appellant: Jack Rephan, Esquire. For the Government: Warren J. Nash,
Assistant Corporation Counsel.

        Opinion by Administrative Judge Zoe BushY


                               OPINION ON RECONSIDERATION

       Appellant, Sherman R. Smoot Corporation (Appellant, SRS) has timely requested
reconsideration of the July 17, 1992, decision concerning the above-captioned consolidated
appeals}1 Board Rule 117.1(d), 36 DCR 2696. The District timely responded in opposition
to the petition (Board Rule 117.4, 36 DCR 2697) and SRS has replied thereto.

       In its decision on the consolidated appeals, the Board held that a contractor's claim
for additional compensation must be denied where it is not timely filed in compliance with
the 30 day notice provisions of the Changes Clause of the Government of the District of
Columbia Standard Contract Provisions. The provision at issue, Article 3. Changes,
Section C, state:

               C.    GENERAL REQUIREMENTS - Except as herein provided, no
        order, statement or conduct of the Contracting Officer shall be treated as a
        change under this Article or entitle the Contractor to an equitable adjustment
        hereunder.

              If any change under this Article causes an increase or decrease in the
        Contractor's cost of, or the time required for, the performance of any part of
        the work under this Contract, whether or not changed by any order, an


    !./As with the original consolidated appeals, this decision on reconsideration is pursuant to the Small
Claims Procedures ofthe Board, D.C. Code § 1-1189.4(d-h) and Board Rule 215, 36 DCR 2702-2708. Because
this decision on reconsideration is rendered by a single administrative judge, it has. no precedential value.

   !/The July 17, 1992, decision is unpublished because it has no precedential value.
                                                        _2 _       CAB Nos. D-863 & D-864, The Sherman R. Smoot Corp.


         equitable adjustment shall be made and the Contract modified in writing
         accordingly. Provided, however, that except for claims based on defective
         specifications, no claim for any change under (B) above shall be allowed for
         any cost incurred more than 20 days before the Contractor gives written
         notice as therein required unless this 20 days is extended by the Contracting
         Officer. And provided further, that in case of defective drawings and
         specifications, the equitable adjustment shall include any increased cost
         reasonably incurred by the Contractor in attempting to comply with such
         defective drawing and specifications.

                If the contractor intends to assert a claim for an equitable adjustment
         under this Article, he must, within 30 days after receipt of a written Change
         Order under (A) above or the furnishing of a written notice under (B) above,
         submit to the Contracting Officer a written statement setting forth the
         general nature and monetary extent of such claim, unless this period is
         extended by the Contracting Officer. The statement of claim hereunder may
         be included in the notice under (B) above.

                No claim by the Contractor for an equitable adjustment hereunder
         shall be allowed if asserted after final payment under the Contract.

The Board cited as support, Appeal of Mirando, Inc., GSBCA 3513, 72-2 BCA ,9483; and
Appeal of Mirando, Inc., GSBCA 3300, 77-1 BCA ,8892.

       Appellant correctly points out, however, that while the Board took into account the
fact that the government must show prejudice for the 20 day notice provision set forth above
to apply, the Board failed to apply the same standard to the 30 day notice provision. SRS
cites as support, Powers Regulator Company, GSBCA Nos. 4668, 4778, 4838, 80-2 BCA
,14,463; Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, IBCA No. 1139-1-77, 77-2 BCA
,12,604; Pittsburgh-Des Moines Corporation, EBCA No. 314-3-84,89-2 BCA ,21,739. The
District responds that it was prejudiced by SRS' failure to notify the District within 30 days
of the monetary extent of SRS' claims, because the District was unable to mitigate its costs.

       Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the decision in this case was based on
legal error and that the 30 day notice provision should not be generally enforced where
there has been no prejudice to the government. Powers Regulator Company, supra,
Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, supra, Pittsburgh-Des Moines Corporation,
supra. In that the District did not raise the 30 day notice provision as an affirmative
defense, it may not now on reconsideration claim that it was unable to mitigate its costs.
General Exhibits, Inc., AGBCA No. 81-260-1, 84-1 BCA ,17,071.¥


    JlIn its July 17, 1992 decision, ~he Board did not reach the issue raised by the District on brief concerning
the lack of authority of the Supervisory Construction Engineer. While this challenge to SRS' claim for
                                                                                                    (continued ... )

       Therefore, the Board's decision of July 17, 1992, is hereby vacated, the appeal is
SUSTAINED, and Appellant is entitled to an equitable adjustment in the amount of
$3,406.12 for CAB No. D-863, and $6,092.21 for CAB No. D-864, plus interest.


DATE:      January 14,·1993

recovery is set forth in the appeal file in CAB No. D-863 at AF 4.3, and in the appeal file in CAB No. D-864
at AF 4.3, it is not set forth in the District's answer in either docket as an affirmative defense, therefore it
will not be considered at this time. General Exhibits, Inc., supra.
