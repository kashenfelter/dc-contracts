      For the Protester, Ace Communications: Mr. Frank Clancy, Jr., pro se. For the District of
Columbia Government: Howard Schwartz, Esq., Senior Assistant Attorney General, and Mark
Hansen, Esq., Assistant Attorney General.

      Opinion by Chief Administrative Judge Jonathan D. Zischkau, with Administrative Judge
Warren J. Nash, concurring.

                                            OPINION
                                         Filing ID 20555807

         Ace Communications protests the District’s award of a contract to Audio Visual Innovations
(“AVI”) to install a new audio/visual system in the Metropolitan Police Department (“MPD”)
Synchronized Operations Command Center (“SOCC”) complex. Ace Communications contends
that it should have received the award because it was an “equally qualified firm” and proposed a
lower price than the awardee. The record shows no error on the part of the contracting officer in
determining that AVI’s offer was more advantageous than Ace’s offer, considering technical and
price factors. AVI’s technical proposal was rated significantly higher than Ace’s proposal such that
the relatively smaller pricing advantage for Ace did not change the ultimate ranking of offerors with
AVI ranked highest. We conclude that the contracting officer’s evaluation and selection did not
violate the terms of the solicitation or District law. Accordingly, we deny the protest.

                                         BACKGROUND

       On December 13, 2007, the District of Columbia Office of Contracting and Procurement
(“OCP”), on behalf of the MPD, issued Request for Proposals (“RFP”) No. DCTO-2008-R-0025 for
the provision and installation of a new audio/visual retrofit in various locations at the MPD SOCC
complex. (AR Ex. 1, Sec. B.1). The scope of work required the upgrade/replacement of the
audio/visual system in the (1) SOCC Command Information Center; (2) SOCC Intelligence
Operations Center; (3) SOCC Secure Compartmented Information Facility; (4) SOCC Conference
Room; (5) Chief’s Conference Room; and (6) MPD HQ Conference Room. The contractor was
required to replace/upgrade the AMX control system and assure connectivity with various other
systems. OCP intended to award a fixed-price contract to the offeror with a proposal most
advantageous to the District. (AR Ex. 2, Sec. L). The District did not amend the RFP, and received
four proposals prior to the January 5, 2008 closing date. (AR Ex.2, at 3).

        Section B.3.1 of the RFP required fixed-unit prices. The RFP contemplated eight CLINs for
the base period, which were to be added by the offerors to propose a total price for the base period.
Additionally, the RFP contemplated four fixed-price one year option periods to provide maintenance
                                                 -2-              Ace Communications, CAB No. P-0772

and warranty of the audio/visual retrofit. (AR Ex. 1, Sec. B). The District intended to award the
contract to the offeror whose proposal provided the best value to the District. (AR Ex. 1, Sec. M).

        The contracting officer convened a source selection panel on January 17, 2008, and provided
instructions on how to properly evaluate the technical proposals consistent with the rating scale
contained in the RFP, including instruction that each score had to be substantiated by recording the
strengths and weaknesses. The solicitation provided a maximum of 70 points for the technical
evaluation criteria, divided into four categories:

               Understanding of the requirement:                        20 points
               Management of operations and resumes:                    20 points
               Quality control:                                         20 points
               Past performance:                                        10 points

       The source selection panel evaluated the four technical proposals and forwarded the
following consensus scores to the contracting officer:

                   Factor 1         Factor 2           Factor 3        Factor 4     Total

(AR Ex. 2, at 8). The evaluators determined that only AVI provided a true turnkey solution and
provided timelines for the work that met the requirements of the solicitation. Other comments
included that AVI fully understood the requirements, had a clear and concise proposal, and more
than 30 years experience. (AR Ex. 4). The contracting officer, contracting specialist, and cost/price
analyst evaluated each offeror’s price proposal. (AR Ex. 2, at 8). The RFP stated that the best value
proposal would receive the maximum 30 points score for the price factor, with other proposals
receiving proportionally lower scores. (AR Ex. 1, Sec. M.3.2). The contract specialist initially
awarded AVI 30 points for its price evaluation as providing the best value to the District. The
contracting officer corrected the contract specialist’s initial impression on price evaluation,
determining that the maximum 30 points should be awarded to the offeror with the lowest price and
proportionally lower scores to other offerors, consistent with the District’s intent for the pricing
factor:
                                                -3-            Ace Communications, CAB No. P-0772

               Offeror                 Score                  Price
               AVI (awardee)           23                     $1,107,966.71
               Activu                  16                     $1,548,847.85
               Ace (protester)         30                     $868,059.27

(AR Ex. 2, at 11). Vantix received a 0 score for price as they did not provide option year prices and
thus its proposal was unacceptable. The contracting officer therefore determined Ace’s price to be
the lowest. Adding the revised price evaluation scores to the technical evaluation scores yielded the
following point totals:

               Offeror                 Technical              Price           Total
               AVI (awardee)           70                     23              93

       On February 27, 2008, the District awarded the contract to AVI in accordance with RFP
Section L.1.2 which states that the District may award contracts on the basis of initial offers
received, without discussion. The contracting officer determined that the difference in technical
scores between AVI and the protester “virtually eliminated Ace/Tri Tech from consideration for
award.” (AR Ex. 2, at 11).

       On March 4, 2008, Ace filed the instant protest with the Board, contending that “this award
was made to an equally qualified firm whose bid price was significantly higher than the bid price
which we had submitted.” (Protest). By letter dated March 18, 2008, the District notified AVI to
cease performance due to the filing of the protest. On March 21, 2008, the District filed a
Determination and Finding to proceed with the Protest while a Protest is pending (“D&F”), and Ace
Communications opposed the District’s D&F. In an order of March 28, 2008, the Board sustained
the CPO’s determination to proceed.

        Ace filed a motion for summary judgment on March 24, 2008, alleging that the District had
failed to timely file its Agency Report, and thus that the protest allegations should be taken as
unrebutted. The District, however, timely filed its Agency Report later the same day. On March 26,
2008, Ace filed a second motion for summary judgment, contending that the Agency Report was
deficient and incomplete for failing to include its proposal and the proposal of AVI. In the motion,
Ace further contends that the District’s Agency Report was not timely filed because it was not
electronically filed until 5:16 p.m., that is, past the 5 p.m. standard closing time for the Board. On
March 27, the District supplemented the Agency Report by submitting the proposals of Ace and
AVI. The District also argues that the Agency Report was timely filed because the Board’s rule for
electronic filing, Rule 403.1, states that “any document filed with the Board before midnight local
time at the Board’s offices is filed with the Board on that date.”

                                               DISCUSSION

       We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03(a)(1).

         Our standard of review for proposal evaluations and the selection decision is whether they
were reasonable and in accord with the evaluation and selection criteria listed in the solicitation and
whether there were material violations of procurement laws or regulations. Trifax Corp., CAB No.
P-0539, Sept. 25, 1998, 45 D.C. Reg. 8842, 8847. Ace has neither argued nor shown that any aspect
of the evaluation of proposals or selection decision was flawed or unsupported by the record. The
awardee, AVI, received a perfect technical score of 70 points and was the only offeror to provide a
true turnkey solution requested by the solicitation. Ace was a distant third with a technical score of
34 points. Even with its 7 point advantage in pricing, Ace’s total score of 64 points is well below
AVI’s total score of 93. Having reviewed the contracting officer’s selection memorandum, and the
underlying consensus evaluation reports of the evaluation panel, we conclude that the technical
evaluations and selection decision were adequately documented and rationally supported. Regarding
Ace’s allegation that the District’s Agency Report was untimely filed, we agree with the District that
its filing met the Board’s deadline for electronic filing.

        Because Ace has not demonstrated that the evaluations and selection decision violated the
law or the terms of the solicitation, we deny the protest.

       SO ORDERED.
