MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION OF
    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA LOCAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION TO
                 RECONSIDER THE OPINION OF THE
                    CONTRACT APPEALS BOARD


                                  STATEMENT OF THE CASE


         On March 17, 1995, the CAB issued an Opinion in the above-captioned case, denying

the   Prot~st.   DCLDC did not receive its copy of the Opinion from the CAB until March 27,

1995. Pursuant to D.C. Contract Appeals Board ("Board") Rule 313, 36 DCMR 2713 (April

21, 1989), Protestor, District of Columbia Local Development Corporation ("DCLDC"),

respectfully submits this Motion of DCLDC to Reconsider the Opinion of the Contract

Appeals Board. The Motion requests dismissal on the grounds that the CAB made errors of

fact in its Opinion.

        The CAB stated and used as a fundamental factual predicate of its arguments in Part I

of the Opinion that the Solicitation was not an invitation for bids but for a negotiated

contract. The Solicitation was an invitation for bids in that it was a request for competitive



                                                1
sealed proposals under Ch. 16 of the Procurement Regulations. Therefore, the LDC

requirement was a matter of responsiveness not responsibility.

     The Solicitation on page B.l.1 requires sealed responses. Appendix B-2 uses the Ch. 16

cost verification mechanism. The District reserved to itself the benefits of a sealed bid

solicitation and should not be now be given the benefit of non-sealed bid. Sections B.13

through B.15 of the Solicitation set forth sealed bid type requirements and conditions

concerning late proposals, final offers and discussions. The language is language for

competitive sealed solicitations, in other words bids, under Ch.16. This is not a solicitation

for a negotiated contract.

     The District representatives testified that they could not have determined that the

successful bidder was a LDC without the Articles and ByLaws. The CAB confirms this fact

by using those documents to make its own LDC status determination. Thus, the

communications to obtain the Articles and Bylaws were discussions to determine the most

material term of the Solicitation - LDC status.

       Therefore, DCLDC asks that the Motion be granted and DCLDC be heard further

on its Protest.



                                      CONCLUSION



       The Board made errors of fact in its Opinion and Order. Therefore, DCLDC

respectfully requests that the Board Reconsider its Opinion and Order and schedule this

Protest to be heard forthwith.

                                                   Respectfully submitted,
