    Opinion by Administrative Judge Claudia                  D.   Booker   with
Administrative Judges Davis and Marlin concurring.

                                    OPINION

      On January 6, 1988, the Department of Administrative Services (DAS)
issued Invitation for Bids No. 8149-AA-51-0-8-GM (IFB) in the sheltered
market to obtain hand tool sets and other equipment.        See the District of
Columbia's Agency Report, filed with the Board on April 15, 1988, at 2
and exh. A thereto.      At the time of the formal bid opening on February

10,   1988,   DAS found Washington Cable Supply,     Inc.   (WCSI) , to be the
apparent low bidder and Battery Place to be the second low bidder.         Id.
      Battery Place filed this protest with the Board1 on February 17,
1988, alleging that the bid submitted by WCSI was nonresponsive.         Battery
Place argues that WCSI's bid was nonresponsive for two reasons:         WCSI had
made initialed changes to the paragraphs relating to business interests


     1 This case originated during the period when the District of
Columbia Contract Appeals Board was functioning pursuant to
Commissioner's Order No.9, D.C. Code, Supplement V (1978), as amended by
Mayor's Order 82-224, 30 DCMR 497 (January 28, 1983) and Mayor's Order
86-65, 33 DCMR 3006 (May 16, 1986).     Pursuant to the D.C. Procurement
Practices Act of 1985 (PPA) , D.C. Code, sec. 1-1189.1 (1987), a new
independent agency denominated as the Contract Appeals Board was created.
This new Board came into existence on August I, 1988, and succeeded to
the jurisdiction of all cases before the previously established Board.

      in South Africa and Namibia which are set out in Special Condition 9 of
      the    IFBi    and WCSI         had   failed    to use the appropriate bid form                    in
      responding to an addendum to the IFB.                   See the Protest Letter.
             The     District    argues       in    its     Agency      Report    that the paragraphs
      submitted by WSCI pursuant to Special Condition 9 do not contain material
      deviations       from     the    requirements         of    the     IFB.      As    to   the   second
      allegation, the District argues that the IFB did not require that WSCI's
      submission of its response to Addendum No. 1 be on the schedule sheet
      provided in the IFB.
             When this protest was filed DAS was still in the process of evaluat-
      ing bids, and no contract had been awarded.                       See Agency Report at 3.
             Before this Board can consider the merits of any protest, the Board
      must first determine that the protest is properly before it and that it
      has jurisdiction to hear and decide the protest.                           In past decisions this
      Board has held that in order for a bidder to have a cognizable and viable
      protest such that the Board will have jurisdiction, the bidder must be
      aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of a contract.                              A

      bidder is aggrieved when it suffers a loss or injury or when a legal
      right it has is violated by the act complained of.                           See the protests of
      A.A.   Beiro Construction,             Co.,    Inc.,       1 P.D.     60    (D.C.   CAB 1987)     and
      Emergency One,          Inc., CAB No.         P-114    (D.C. CAB November 2, 1988).               The
      Board has also stated that a party is not aggrieved until official
      action,       adverse to it,          has been taken.             See the protests of Hood's

      Institutional Foods             (D.C. CAB January 25,             1989) and Systems Products,

      Inc., CAB No. P-96 (D.C. CAB February 14, 1989).

                 In a protest such as this one, where a protester challenges the
         responsiveness of another's bid, official action sufficient to cause the
         protester to be aggrieved occurs when a contract is awarded.             Absent such
         an action, this protest is premature and speculative. Id.             Here, the mere
         submission of an allegedly nonresponsive bid by WCSI, absent official
         agency action, does not have an injurious impact on Battery Place or any
         other bidder.     No agency action adverse to Battery Place has been taken.
                 Battery Place has failed to show that it is an aggrieved party.
         Therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear and decide the merits of
         the protest.
                 Accordingly,   for   the   reasons    set   forth   above,   the protest   is
         dismissed for lack of juriSdiction.

                                                 ORDER

                 The protest is dismissed.
