                                SUMMARY        or    DECISION
      Protest on sole ground that the apparent low bidder does

not meet the definitive responsibility criteria set forth in

the IFB is dismissed where the agency's action subsequent to

the filing of the protest renders the issue academic or moot

by . determining         that    the     apparent       low     bidder     does      not meet

the   definitive          responsibility              criteria       and       is   otherwise

nonresponsible.

                                             DECISION

      Roofers Incorporated protests that contract award should

not be made to the apparent low bidder, Action Contractors of

Washington,        D.C.    (Action),          under     IPB No.      87-0041-AA-2-0-CC,

issued by the Department of Public Works, on the ground that

Action   does       not     meet        the     minimum       five    years         experience

requirement        set     forth        in     the    Contractor's         Qualifications

provision     of    the    IFB     at    p.     1.4-5.        The    IFB was        issued   to

procure roofing work at the National Guard Armory.

      BY letter dated February 27,                      1987    (f iled with the Board

on March 2, 1987), Mr. Harold T. Henson, Alternate Contracting

Officer, advised the Board that:

            The Government has concluded that Action
      Contractors of Washington, D.C., does not possess
      five years of experience as Jequired by the defini-
      tive responsibility criteria of the specifications,
                                                                     .
                                                                     .
       and is for this and other reasons not responsible to
       do the work.   l\ccordingly, the Government does not
       intend to permit l\ction to perform this work.

The alternate contracting officer,                  therefore,        requested that

the   Boa rd    dismiss      the   protest   as    the      issues        raised   in   the

protest are moot.            The Board agrees that the question raised

by    the    protest   has     been   rendered      academic         or    moot    by   the

Department's       determination         that     l\ction     does        not   meet    the

definitive responsibility criteria set forth in the IFB and is

otherwise nonresponsible.

       l\ccordingly, the protest is                           as "
                                                                 moot.
