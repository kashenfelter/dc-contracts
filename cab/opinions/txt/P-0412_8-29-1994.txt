                        OPINION AND ORDER ON MOTION TO DISMISS

        This matter concerns a protest filed with the Board on July 18, 1994, by Electronic
Systems USA, Inc. ("protestor" or "ESI") against Solicitation No. 94-0043-AA-4-0-CC ("IFB")
for an annual maintenance contract for temperature and automated control systems for the
District of Columbia Courthouse. The grounds for the protest are that the specifications were
too restrictive and limited competition. On August 19, 1994, the District of Columbia
("District") filed a motion to dismiss the protest on the ground that it was untimely filed.
Protestor did not respond to the District's motion.

        For the reasons set forth below, we GRANT the District's motion to dismiss the protest.

       The facts show that the Department of Public Works ('DPW") issued the IFB in the open
market on May 25, 1994. (Motion to Dismiss, Exhibits 1 and 2).1 Apparently, 308 prospective
bidders were notified of the solicitation. (MD, Ex. 2). Bid opening was scheduled for June 29,
1994. (MD, Exs. 1 and 2). On June 6 DPW issued Addendum No. 1 to the IFB, which
postponed the bid opening date to July 13, 1994. (MD, Ex. 3). Protestor picked up a copy of
the addendum. (MD, Ex. 4).

        By letter dated J ul y 1, 1994, i. e., prior to the revised bid opening date, ESI filed a
protest with the DPW contract manager, alleging that the specifications allowed only one vendor,
Honeywell, Inc., the opportunity to perform the work, thereby limiting competition. By letter
dated July 7, 1994, the Acting Administrator of the Facilities Operation and Maintenance
Administration, DPW, acknowledged ESI's protest but advised it that it should file its protest
with the District of Columbia Contract Appeals Board. The Acting Administrator also informed
protestor that bid opening was still scheduled for July 13, 1994. While we have no information
as to when ESI received the July 71etter, ESI filed its protest with the Board on July 18, 1994. 2


    'Hereinafter. exhibits attached to the motion to dismiss will be referred to as "MD. Ex(s).

    2'fhe facts show that bid opening occurred on July 13 and that Honeywell. Inc. was the only bidder. (MD.
Ex. 5). Thus. it is possible that the protest may have had some merit. However. as will be discussed below.
protestor's failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements for filing a bid protest has prevented
                                                      -2 -            Electronic Systems USA, CAB No. P-412



        Citing the lO-working-day requirement contained in section 908(b) of the Procurement
Practices Act of 1985 (PPA), D.C. Code § 1-1189.8(b) (Supp. 1992), and our decision in Koba
Associates, Inc., CAB No. P-325, December 1, 1992,40 DCR 4730, the District argues that
protests based on alleged solicitation improprieties must be filed with the Board prior to the
closing date for receipt of proposals or bid opening. According to the District, because ESl filed
its protest with the Board after bid opening, its protest is untimely and must be dismissed.

       The District is correct in that section 908(b) of the PPA requires that a protest must be
filed with the Board within 10 working days after the aggrieved party knew or should have
known of the basis for its protest. This lO-working-day filing requirement is jurisdictional and
cannot be waived. Chesapeake Bus & Equipment Co., CAB No. P-404, June 30, 1994, 7 P.D.
5887; Interior Systems, Inc., CAB No. P-398, January 10, 1994, 6 P.D. 5544; Roche
Biomedical Laboratories, Inc., CAB No. P-374, June 17, 1993,41 DCR 3479. Furthermore,
we have held that where a bidder initially attempts to resolve its protest with the procuring
agency, it is not excused from making the appropriate filing with the Board within the requisite
time period. See Emerald Eviction Services, CAB No. P-343, November 10, 1992, 40 DCR
4700; Genesis 1Il, Inc., CAB No. P-304, October IS, 1992, 40 DCR 4630; D.H. Kim
Enterprises, Inc., CAB No. P-293, December 12, 1991,39 DCR 4365. This is so because an
aggrieved party is deemed, as a matter of law, to have constructive knowledge of the provisions
of the PPA, the District's procurement regulations, the Board's rules and the Board's decisions
because they are published in the District of Columbia Code, the District of Columbia Municipal
Regulations and the District of Columbia Register. Id. See Mercer Products & Manufacturing
Co.-Recon., B-25 I 126, November 30,1992,92-2 CPD, 385; Hersha Enterprises, Ltd. tla
Quality Inn-Riveifront, B-244863, July 25, 1991,91-2 CPD , 93; Hilda A. Phelps-Recon.,
B-242329, March 12, 1991,91-1 CPD, 273; Irvin Technologies, Inc., GSBCA No. 11581-P,
92-1 BCA '24,640; Rocky Mountain Trading Company Systems Division, GSBCA No. 10925-P-
R, 92-1 BCA '24,557.

        Notwithstanding these rules, the District has certain legal obligations as well. By
regulation the District is required to inform prospective bidders and offerors in each solicitation
issued that protests must be filed in accordance with section 908 of the PPA. 27 DCMR §
3800.2 (July 1988). The facts of the present matter show that except for a vague reference to
the PPA contained in an amendment to the Standard Contract Provisions,3 nothing contained
in the IFB advised bidders of the requirement to file protests directly with the Board. 4
Compare FAR §§ 33.106 and 52.233-2. We believe that by failing to do so, the agency may
have violated District regulations to the prejudice of prospective bidders. 5


our consideration of the issue.

    'MD, Ex. I, SPECIFICATION .

    'Were it not for our careful review of the solicitation documents, this failure may not have come to our
attention.

     ' Our earlier decisions on the filing of agency protests did nol consider whether the solicitation contained a
provision in compliance with 27 DCMR § 3800.2. In this regard, many prospective bidders are unsophisticated
in the myriad of statutory and regulatory provisions which govern District procurements; and a vague reference to
                                                        -3-             Electronic Systems USA, CAB No . P-412

        Consequently, we now put parties to District procurements on notice that we will review
all solicitation documents for inclusion of the required protest provision in the context of the
timeliness of protests filed initially with the procurement agency.6 We are required to ensure,
in accordance with the purposes of the PPA, that, inter alia, competition is enhanced, that
parties will have a fair opportunity to present their cases and that protests will be resolved in an
equitable and reasonably speedy manner-without unduly disrupting the procurement process.
Thus, fairness and the overriding purposes of the PPA may dictate the need to change our
application of the rules with respect to protests filed with the agency.7

       Therefore, based upon all of the facts and circumstances and the reasons set forth herein,
the District's motion to dismiss the protest is GRANTED; and it is hereby

        ORDERED, that the protest be, and the same is, DISMISSED with prejudice.

the PPA does nothing to put bidders on notice of their rights and remedies in the event of a perceived defect in the
procurement process. CJ., C&E Services, Inc., CAB No. P-392(A), June 7, 1994,7 P.D. 5864 (vague references
to the Buy American Act fall far short of objective measurable criteria required to be set forth in a solicitation).

    "See generally Reichley v. District of Columbia Departmelll of Employmem Services, 53l A.2d 244 (D .C. App.
1987) and Mendes v. Johnson, 389 A.2d 781 (D .C. App. 1978), which discuss the standards for an administrative
tribunal ' s adjudication which announces a new rule of law and overrules a different rule established by prior
adjudication.

    'While the instant matter may be an anomaly, District procurement officials should review all solicitations before
issuance to ensure that the required regulatory provision is included.
