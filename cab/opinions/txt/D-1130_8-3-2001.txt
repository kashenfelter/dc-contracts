AMENDMENT TO ORDER ON APPELLEE’S MOTION FOR STAY OF PENDING APPEAL


       By order dated March 28, 2001, in order to insure an orderly presentation of this matter
before the Board, as amended by order dated July 17, 2001, the Board stayed all action in this
proceeding until July 27, 2001. The Board has been informed by counsel for the District that an
“extension is needed to allow the parties additional time for exchanges in their settlement
negotiations.”

        Based on the representation of counsel, the Board amends the order of March 28, 2001 to
extend the stay in this matter until Friday August 17, 2001. The order of March 28, 2001, was
conditioned upon the “OCFO notify[ing] each of its own personnel who have had any relationship to
the subject contract, as well as personnel at each other District agency or non-District entity who
have had any relationship to the contract, of the pendency of this matter before the Board and direct
that such persons maintain and preserve any document, record or information, in any form, directly
or indirectly related to performance of the subject contract.” The duty to maintain and preserve re
cords with regard to the subject contract continues during the extended stay.


        SO ORDERED.


DATED: August 3, 2001
