                                 GOVERNMENT OF DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
                                       CONTRACT APPEALS BOARD



            APPEAL OF:

                 FT. MYER CONSTRUCTION
                                                                      CAB No. D-859
                 Under Contract No. 1028-62


                                CLARIFICATION OF DECISION AND ORDER!!

               On November 3, 1992, the Board issued a decision in the matter
            captioned above, which sustained the appeal and remanded the matter
            to the contracting officer for payment to the appellant in the
            amount of $82,207.95. The remand to the contracting officer made
            no mention of payment of interest.

               By letter dated March 3, 1993 (filed March 5, 1993), appellant
            advised the Board that while the government subsequently issued a
            change order in the amount of $82,207.92 in compliance with the
            Board's decision, the amount of the change order did not include
            interest payable in accordance with D.C. Code §§ 1-1188.6 and 28-
            3302 (b) (1987).

                Attached to appellant's letter of March 3, 1993, is a copy of a
            letter dated March 2, 1993, from the chief of the agency's
            litigation section to appellant's general counsel.     Therein, the
            agency's counsel stated that the issue of interest is not an
            independent claim but is "subsumed" in the claims that were decided
            by the Board.   Counsel went on to state that because the Board's
            decision was final and made no award of interest, the government
            would not pay interest.

               First, we consider appellant's letter of March 3, 1993, as a
            request for clarification of the Board's November 3, 1992,
            decision.  Second, we agree with appellant that we should issue a
            clarification forthwith in order to avoid litigation.

              In our view, appellant is correct: interest is payable on
           appellant's'claim in accordance with D.C. Code §§ 1-1188.6 and 28-
           3302(b). The statutory language is clear and unambiguous in that
           payment of interest on amounts found due a contractor is mandated,
           notwithstanding t~r fact that the Board's decision made no mention
           of such payment. -    The government's assertion, made without
           benefit of legal or factual support, that interest was "subsumed"


               !!Administrative Judge Benjamin B. Terner did not take part in
           this decision due to an extended illness.

               ~/It was by virtue of this statutory mandate that the Board did
           not include an order concerning payment of interest in its monetary
           award to appellant.

             in the appellant's claim evinces a clear misunderstanding of the
             law.

                 Consequently, it is hereby

               ORDERED, that the Board's decision of November 3, 1992, be, and
