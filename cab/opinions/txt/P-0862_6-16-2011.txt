                                       Filing ID 38185928

        Goel Services, Inc. (“Goel”) protests the award of a contract for the demolition of the
D.C. General Hospital’s former pediatric unit (hereafter “Hill East Building 10”) to Keystone
Plus Construction. Goel challenges the award on the grounds that the contracting officer’s
nonresponsibility determination erred in concluding that Goel could not meet the detailed
schedule of performance required by the solicitation, submitted an unrealistically low bid price,
and failed to submit evidence of the categorized project cost breakdown. Goel also contends that
the Contracting Officer’s award to Keystone was a sham, noting that the Determination and
Finding (“D&F”) to award the contract to Keystone was completed before obtaining
responsibility information from the protester (the apparent low bidder). After carefully
reviewing the entire record herein, we conclude that the contracting officer did not violate law,
regulation, or the terms of the solicitation in determining Goel to be nonresponsible.
Accordingly, we deny the protest.

                                       BACKGROUND

         On June 23, 2010, the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic
Development (“DMPED”) issued IFB No. DCEB-DMPED-10-I-0012 (“IFB”) in the open
market. (Agency Report (“AR”); AR Ex. 1 and 7). The IFB was for a contractor to provide all
labor, materials and equipment to fully execute the requirements to demolish the existing
building, including removing all site furnishings and appurtenances and cutting or abandoning
site utilities at Hill East Building 10, located at 1900 Massachusetts Avenue, SE, Washington
D.C., in accordance with the scope of work. (AR Ex. 1).

       The bid opening date was June 30, 2010. (AR Ex. 1). By 2:00 p.m. on June 30, 2010, the
following three bidders submitted lump sum bids:
                                                -2-              Goel Services, Inc., CAB No. P-0862


             Bidder                   Total Price            Total Evaluated Bid
         Horton & Barber             $3,250,000.00             $2,860,000.00
               Goel                  $3,985,000.00              $3,985,000.00
         Keystone Plus
                                     $4,398,000.00              $4,090,140.00
          Construction
       (AR Ex. 5)

       The Contracting Officer determined that Horton & Barber was the apparent low bidder.
The Contracting Officer also determined that Horton & Barber’s bid was nonresponsive since
Horton & Barber failed to submit a bid bond with their bid. (AR Ex. 7).

       Further, by a Determination and Findings for Contractor Nonresponsibility (“D&F for
Nonresponsibility”) dated July 14, 2010, the Contracting Officer determined Goel
nonresponsible. (AR Ex. 6). By a Determination and Findings for Award to Other Than Low
Bidder dated June 30, 2010, the District recommended award to Keystone Plus Construction
(“Keystone”) as it met all the requirements of the solicitation. (AR Ex. 6).

        The District awarded Contract No. DCEB-DMPED-10-C-0012 (“contract”) dated August
11, 2010, to Keystone. On August 20, 2010, Goel filed the instant protest challenging the
District’s determination of nonresponsibility. On August 24, 2010, the District issued to
Keystone a Notice to Cease Performance. By a Determination and Findings to Proceed with
Contract Performance after Receipt of a Protest dated August 24, 2010, OCP determined that it
was in the best interest of the District to proceed with contract performance while the protest is
pending. On August 25, 2010, pursuant to the Determination and Findings to Proceed with
Contract Performance after Receipt of a Protest, the District issued to Keystone a Notice to
Resume Performance. (AR Ex. 11). On August 31, 2010, Goel filed a Motion Challenging the
District’s Determination and Findings to Proceed with Contract Performance after Receipt of a
Protest (“Motion to Challenge”). On September 2, 2010, the District filed its Response to the
Protester’s Motion to Challenge. On September 24, 2010, the Board sustained the Chief
Procurement Officer’s written determination to proceed with contract performance.

       Goel challenges the Contracting Officer’s determination of nonresponsibility regarding
Goel’s bid. The District responds that the District properly determined Goel nonresponsible.

                                         DISCUSSION

         Goel alleged in its protest that the Contracting Officer erred when he found Goel
nonresponsible. Goel expanded its argument when it filed the Challenge to the D&F to proceed
with contract performance. In the challenge to the D&F, Goel sets forth its version of a
telephone conversation of June 30, 2010, between Mr. P.J. Goel and the Contracting Officer
regarding Goel’s ability to perform the contract. (Ex. 2, Challenge to D&F, Declaration of
Piyush J. Goel). Mr. Goel further asserts that the Contracting Officer did not contact the
protester on any other occasion to discuss the bid, and that the Contracting Officer did not
request any other information or documents from Goel.

       The Contracting Officer prepared a D&F for Contractor Nonresponsibility on July 14,
2010. (AR Ex. 6). In that D&F, the Contracting Officer set forth his reasons for finding Goel
nonresponsible.

          The Procurement Regulations set forth the District’s rules regarding responsibility. 27
DCMR § 2200.4 states that “[t]o be determined responsible, a prospective contractor shall meet
all of the following requirements:

       (a) Financial resources adequate to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain
       them;

        (b) Ability to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance
       schedule, taking into consideration all existing commercial and governmental
       business commitments;

       (c) A satisfactory performance record;

       (d) A satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics;

       (e) The necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls,
       and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them;

       (f) Compliance with the applicable District licensing and tax laws and regulations;

       (g) The necessary production, construction, and technical equipment and
       facilities, or the ability to obtain them; and

       (h) Other qualifications and eligibility criteria necessary to receive an award
       under applicable laws and regulations.”

Moreover, 27 DCMR § 2200.5 provides as follows:

       If the contracting officer determines that the price bid or offered by a prospective
       contractor is so low as to appear unreasonable or unrealistic, the contracting
       officer may determine the prospective contractor to be nonresponsible.

As indicated in the D & F for Nonresponsibility, on July 2, 2010, the Contracting Officer
contacted Goel and spoke with Goel about whether Goel could meet the performance schedule.
According to the Contracting Officer, Goel indicated that it would perform the project within the
time stated in the IFB but failed to provide any further details. Additionally, the Contracting
Officer determined that Goel’s bid was unrealistically low. Goel failed to provide the District
with evidence of the project cost breakdown, as required by Section B.7 (E) of the IFB. When
asked by the Contracting Officer to explain their costs to knock down a building, Goel responded
“that they knock down buildings all the time.” (AR Ex. 6). Goel submitted a price for removal
of contaminated soil at $25.00 per ton. The Contracting Officer determined that a realistic
estimate is $50.00 to $95.00 per ton.
                                                 -4-               Goel Services, Inc., CAB No. P-0862


         In addition, the Contracting Officer determined that Goel submitted unrealistically low
amounts for cutting and patching existing fixtures, and for the demolition of the building. Goel
submitted a price of $10,000 for cutting and patching fixtures whereas the Contracting Officer
determined that a realistic estimate is $75,000 to $100,000. Goel submitted a price of $600,000
for building demolition whereas the Contracting Officer determined that a realistic price for that
work would be $900,000.

         This Board has consistently held “that the determination of a prospective contractor’s
responsibility is the duty of the contracting officer and that that official is vested with wide
discretion and business judgment.” Protest of: Kidd International Home Care Services, Inc., No.
P-547, Sept. 15, 1998, 45 D.C. Reg. 8835; Protest of: Aceco, LLC., CAB No. P-486, July 23,
1997, 44 D.C. Reg. 6852; Protest of: Central Armature/Fort Myer, CAB No. P-478, June 6,
1997, 44 D.C. Reg. 6823; Protest of: Ideal Electrical Supply Corporation, CAB No. P-372, Aug.
13, 1993, 41 D.C. Reg. 3603. See 27 DCMR §§ 2200, 2204. Therefore, in reviewing a
determination concerning general standards of responsibility, we will not overturn a finding of
responsibility or nonresponsibility unless the protestor shows bad faith on the part of the agency
or that the determination lacks any reasonable basis. Protest of: Ideal Electrical Supply
Corporation, supra. See also Protest of: Alexandria Scale t/a Bay Scale, Inc., CAB No. P-361,
1993 DCBCA Lexis 277, (March 25, 1993).

        In the Protest of: Group Insurance Administration, Inc., CAB No. P-309-B, Sept. 2,
1992 40 D.C. Reg. 4485 (aff’d, No. 92-12406 Super. Ct. Apr. 25, 1994) this Board expressed its
standard of review as follows:

       This Board will not reverse an affirmative determination of responsibility, which is
       largely a business judgment, unless the protestor shows possible fraud or bad faith on the
       part of procurement officials, or that the solicitation contains definitive responsibility
       criteria which have not been met. It is well-established that procurement officials are
       presumed to act in good faith; and in order for this Board to conclude otherwise, the
       record must show that the procuring officials had a specific, malicious intent to harm the
       protestor.

        This Board will not reverse an affirmative determination of responsibility or non-
responsibility unless there is evidence of bad faith on the part of the District. In this regard, the
protestor provides no evidence of bad faith. In papers filed by the protester after its initial
response to the agency report, the protester alleged bad faith on the part of the District regarding
the Contracting Officer’s determination of nonresponsibility. It appears that the protester
forwarded the allegations to the Inspector General in August of 2010. However, the protester
provided no further information regarding the alleged bad faith of any District officials.

        Any discussion of bad faith by government officials must begin with an analysis of the
conduct that constitutes the bad faith. Kalvar Corporation, Inc. v. United States, 211 Ct.Cl. 192,
543 F.2d 1298 (1976), involved a claim contending that the Government had shown bad faith or
clear abuse of discretion in determining that films requested by one agency were beyond the
scope of the primary source contract and that plaintiff had incurred costs that were recoverable
under the termination for convenience clause of contract. In analyzing the proof needed to prove
bad faith, the court stated:
                                                -5-               Goel Services, Inc., CAB No. P-0862


               Any analysis of a question of Governmental bad faith must begin with the
       presumption that public officials act conscientiously in the discharge of their
       duties”. Librach v. United States, 147 Ct.Cl. 605, 612 (1959). The court has
       always been ‘loath to find to the contrary,’ and it requires ‘well-nigh irrefragable
       proof’ to induce the court to abandon the presumption of good faith dealing.
       Knotts v. United States, 121 F.Supp. 630, 631, 128 Ct.Cl. 489, 492 (1954).

               In the cases where the court has considered allegations of bad faith, the
       necessary ‘irrefragable proof’ has been equated with evidence of some specific
       intent to injure the plaintiff. Thus, in Gadsden v. United States, 78 F.Supp. 126,
       127; 111 Ct.Cl. 487, 489-90 (1948), the court compared bad faith to actions
       which are ‘motivated alone by malice.’ In Knotts, supra, at 128 Ct.Cl. 500, 121
       F.Supp. 636, the court found bad faith in a civilian pay suit only in view of a
       proven ‘conspiracy * * * to get rid of plaintiff.’ Similarly, the court in Struck
       Constr. Co. v. United States, 96 Ct.Cl. 186, 222 (1942) found bad faith when
       confronted by a course of Governmental conduct which was ‘designedly
       oppressive.’ But in Librach, supra, at 147 Ct.Cl. 614, the court found no bad
       faith because the officials involved were not ‘actuated by animus toward the
       plaintiff.’

        Bad faith cannot consist solely of mistakes, but it must also include some specific intent
to injure the plaintiff. After reviewing the record in this procurement, we have determined that
the Contracting Officer acted appropriately in finding Goel nonresponsible. Goel failed to detail
how it would meet the project’s performance schedule, and submitted unrealistically low bids for
removal of contaminated soil, cutting and patching existing fixtures, and building demolition.
Additionally, we see no evidence of any bad faith committed by any District official toward the
protester.

                                        CONCLUSION

       For the reasons discussed above, we dismiss Goel’s protest to the award of the contract.

       SO ORDERED.
