                            OPINION DISMISSING PROTEST
                                       Filing ID 22338111


        Cheeks of North America, Inc. (“CNA”) protests the determination by the District of
Columbia Water and Sewer Authority ("WASA") that its bid was nonresponsive based on a bid
bond defect. WASA filed a motion to dismiss the protest on the grounds that the Board lacks
jurisdiction to consider protests of WASA contract awards. Because WASA is exempt from our
protest jurisdiction, we agree that the protest must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

                                      BACKGROUND

        WASA issued Solicitation No. 080020 for replacement of small diameter priority water
mains. At bid opening on August 20, 2008, CNA contends that it was the low bidder. However,
by letter of September 9, 2008, the WASA contracting officer advised CNA that its bid was
determined nonresponsive due to a bid bond defect. On September 30, 2008, CNA filed a
protest of the award on the grounds of: “bid rigging, discrimination, failure to give adequate
notice and time to cure compliance issues for invitation award.” (Protest, at 1). On October 14,
2008, WASA moved to dismiss the protest on the ground that our Board lacks jurisdiction to
consider the protest.

                                        DISCUSSION

       Section 2-309.03(b) of the D.C. Code provides that “[j]urisdiction of the Board shall be
consistent with the coverage of this chapter [the Procurement Practices Act] as defined in §§ 2-
301.04 and 2-303.20 . . . ." D.C. Code § 2-301.04(a) (“Application of chapter”) provides that:

       Except as provided in § 2-303.20, this chapter shall apply to all departments,
       agencies, instrumentalities, and employees of the District government, including
       agencies which are subordinate to the Mayor, independent agencies, boards, and
       commissions . . . .”
                                            -2-                        CNA, Inc., CAB No. P-0786



      D.C. Code § 2-303.20(j) provides a specific exemption for WASA:

      Nothing in this chapter shall affect the District of Columbia Water and Sewer
      Authority's powers to establish and operate its procurement system and to execute
      contracts pursuant to Chapter 22 of Title 34.

       Consistent with this provision, WASA published its procurement regulations which are
found at 21 DCMR Chapter 53. Its regulation relating to protests of WASA solicitations and
awards is set forth at 21 DCMR § 5330, which provides in part:

      5330.3 A person protesting an award decision is required to file the protest with
      the Contracting Officer within five (5) working days of when the protester knew
      or should have known of the facts and circumstances upon which the protest is
      based. . . .

        Because WASA is exempt from the Procurement Practices Act, we have no jurisdiction
over protests of WASA awards. Dixon’s Termite and Pest Management, CAB No. P-0706, May
4, 2005, 54 D.C. Reg. 1917, 1918; Dixon’s Termite and Pest Control, Inc., CAB No. P-0659,
Aug. 7, 2002, 50 D.C. Reg. 7453, 7454. Accordingly, we dismiss CNA’s protest for lack of
jurisdiction.

      SO ORDERED.
