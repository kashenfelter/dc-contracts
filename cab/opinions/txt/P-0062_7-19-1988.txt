                                  SUMMARY OF DECISION

        1.   SOLICITATION CANCELLATION.--

             a.    The   regulation of the Minority Business Opportunity

Commission ("MBOC") requiring that" [olnce an agency has placed a

contract in the sheltered market,                 it shall not be removed by the

agency without the approval of the Commission" was violated by the

llEOC   in   connection         with   the     cancellation      and   removal    of   the

invitation from          the sheltered market and              its   reissuance   in   the

open market for the reasons              that     (1)    the IIEOC commissioners did

not affirmatively approve the removal of the invitation                           and (2)

the MBOC Staff Director's approval of the invitation's removal was

without a clear delegation of authority in the MBOC resolution to

which attention was called to by the District.

              b.    Where conflict exists between the D.C.                  Procurement

Regulations and the rlEOC's              regulations on the necessity for the

procuring      agency      to    first       obtain     the   MBOC's   approval    before

cancelling a        sheltered market solicitation and                  resoliciting    the
                                                 -       2 -

requirement in the open market,                              the conflict,        in the interest of

adjudicatory          efficiency,          should              be    resolved        at    the   earliest

practicable time by appropriate rulemaking.

        2.     JURISDICTION.--

               a.     Contrary       to    the           District's        contention,        the   Board,

under the D.C. Procurement Practices Act                                 (npPAn)       (D.C. Code,       §    1-

1189.8(c) (1987 Replacement)) has clear authority to hear protests

raising      the procedural          question of whether an                          alleged condition

precedent contained in the                 ~IBOC     I   S    regulation to the proper removal

of the invitation from the sheltered market was satisfied.

               b.     The Board does not have jurisdiction to consider the

protester's         allegation       that       the           MBOC's     actions       relative     to       the

removal of the invitation from the sheltered market violated the

contested       case       hearing        provisions                of   the    D.C.       Administrative

Procedure Act          ("DCAPA") because there is nothing in the PPA which

can be fairly construed as empowering it to administer or enforce

the DCAPA.

        3.     REMEDY.--Although the Board finds                               that the MBOC failed

to    comply        with    its     regulation                governing        its    approval      of       the

removal of a          solicitation from the sheltered market,                                it does not

feel that       its failure warrants the                        relief the protester requests

(namely,     cancellation of the open market procurement and issuance

of a new invitation in the sheltered market or termination for the

convenience of             the District of any awarded contract)                              because        (1)

the circumstances resulting in the removal of the invitation from

the    sheltered           market     fell           squarely            within      the     MBOC's      rule

permitting it          to approve         the        removal of a              solicitation from             the
                                                      - 3 -

sheltered market,                 (2)    the    protester        did       not    give      any plausible

reason and the Board does not discern any which would suggest that

if    the    ~lBOC    had       affirmatively           acted       on    the     removal      information

presented to it by the Staff Director,                               it might have disapproved

the removal of the invitation from the sheltered market and (3) it

is questionable whether the protester                                (who was         determined to be

nonresponsible             in     the    predecessor           sheltered         market       procurement)

would       have     benefited           from     a     cancellation             of   the     open    market

invitation           and     a     resolicitation              of        the     requirement         in   the

sheltered market given the                       relative short period                   (l   1/2 months)

between       the    nonresponsibility determination and                              the     issuance     of

the     open       market         invitation          and     further          considering       that     the

protester          did     not    challenge           the     nonresponsibility             determination

before this Board.


                                                 DECISION

            D.L.H.       Industries,            Inc.        ("DLH"),       a     minority       business,

protests the issuance of IFB No. 7392-AA-89-0-7-HT ("IFB") in the

open market.             See Protest of Solicitation filed on July 29. 1987.

The IFB was           issued by the Department of Administrative Services

(" DAS") to procure bread products.                            See Agency Report, Exhibit A.

            The facts which gave rise to DLH's protest are that prior

to the        issuance of           the IFB,          DAS placed in the sheltered market

(for certified minority bidders only) a similar invitation,                                               IFB

No. 7045-AA-89-0-7-HT for bread and bakery products.                                           See Agency

Report,        Exhibi t      C.         Because DLH was             the        only minority         firm to

submit a bid in response to the sheltered market invitation and




                                                                                                                /) fi I)
                                                - 4 -

was found to be nonresponsible, DAS' Director determined that the

invitation "must be cancelled" and                       n   [tlhe requirements for bread

and   bakery       products will           be    resolicited          in       the     open    market. n

Agency    Report,       Exhibit        F-2,     paragraph        4.       Facts        Which    Justify

Cance llation.         Based on this determination,                        DAS       issued the IFB,

as it did, in the open market.                     Agency Report at 1.

         DLH essentially alleges that the issuance of the IFB on the

open market was unlawful due to two procedural defects:                                         (1) the

removal of the predecessor invitation from the sheltered market

was   not approved by the commissioners of                            the l1inority Business

Opportunity Commission (nHBOC") as required by the t1BOC's rule at

27    DCNR     §     604.9     (June       1985)      and      (2)        the    removal        of    the

invitation,         if approved by the MBOC, was not in accordance with

the   contested        case         hearing      requirements             of     the     District      of

Columbia Administrative Procedure Act                          ("DCAPA n ), D.C. Code, § 1-

1509 (1981).

         The       District        filed   an    agency        report          setting        forth   its

disagreement on the merits with DLH's allegations.                                       In addition,

the District filed a motion to dismiss this protest.

         The District's motion to dismiss will be addressed first.

The District asserts                that because         nthe t1inority Contracting Act

grants exclusive authority to the HBOC to review the plans of the

contracting agencies to place contracts                              in the sheltered market

. "          there     is     no     basis      for     review       by     this       Board     of   the

procedures used             by the I1BOC        in approving contracting agencies'

decisions regarding advertising in the open or sheltered market. n

District      of    Columbia           at     2.         The    au thori ties           cited    for       this

assertion are Abstracts, Inc., I P.D. 106 (D.C. CAB 1987), Aceves

Construction        &   Ilaintenance Company, 1 P.D. 50 (D.C. CAB 1987) and

Southern      International Corporation,                            1 P.D.       30    (D.C.    CAB 1987).

DLH opposed         the      District's            asserted          ground       for    dismissal.          In

general,       it       contends            that     the        District              misinterprets         the

procurement         law      in   the       District       of       Columbia.           See    Protester's

Comments      on Motion           to    Dismiss          Protest;          or    in     the Alternative,

Reply of the District of Columbia at 2 and 3.

         In   the Abstracts             and Southern                cases,       the     Board concluded

that since the MBOC has conclusive authority under the Minority

Contracting Act (D.C. Law 1-95, as amended,                                      D.C. Code,      §   1-1141,

et~.          (1981)),       the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear and decide

protest complaints alleging error in certification actions taken

by the MBOC.            See Abstracts at 110-111 and Southern at 31-32.l1

Here,    unlike         in   Abstracts             and    Southern,             the    Board    is    not    in

effect     being        asked     to    go     behind          an    action       or     a   determination

falling in the exclusive province of the MBOC and pass judgment

on   its      propriety.               Rather,       the        question          presented      by    DLH's

protest is whether an alleged condition precedent in the MBOC's

regulation         to     the     proper       removal          of        the    invitation       from      the

sheltered market              and      the    reissuance             of    the    requirement         on    the

open market was satisfied.




liThe  District's reference to Aceves is not considered to be
possibly relevant since it did not deal with the question of the
Board's authority to review a certification action taken by the
IIBOC.

        The District of Columbia Procurement Practices Act of 1985

("PPA") mandates that the Board "decide whether the solicitation

or award       [being protested] was in accordance with the applicable

law, regulations, and terms and conditions of the solicitation."

D.C.    Code,     §    1-1l89.8(c)             (1987       Replacement).          This    provision

plainly enough gives the Board authority to decide whether any

applicable law or regulation was violated by the issuance of the

IFB in the open market.                  Unquestionably, because of the minority

contracting       factor          in     this       case,       any    minority          contracting

provisions       in    the       law    or    regulations having            a     bearing      on     the

solicitation process is as much a part of the applicable law and

regulations           as    is     the        PPA    and       the    District       of     Columbia

Procurement       Regulations                ("DCPR").      Thus,     on    the    basis       of     the

foregoing discussion,                  the Board rejects the District's argument

that it lacks jurisdiction to hear DLH's protest.

         Having determined that the Board has                           jurisdiction in this

case,     it     now       proceeds           to     cons ider        the   meri ts       of        DLH' s

allegations.           Section 604.9 begins,                "Once an agency has placed a

contract in the sheltered market,                          it shall not be removed by the

agency    without          the    approval          of   the    Commission."        The     District

states that information regarding the cancellation of the IFB and

its issuance in the open market was presented by the MBOC staff

to the commissioners during their executive sessions on July 15

and August 18, 1987.               Agency Report at 6.                 The District, however,

states in response to the Board's query,                              that the commissioners

did not take any action on the information that was presented to

C.3 and Answers C.I, C.2 and C.3.

        That     being        the      case,    the     Board     reaches     the   District's

defense that the MBOC's Staff Director approved the                                 removal of

the invitation from the sheltered market, and she was authorized

to approve       the     removal         in    behalf      of   the   commissioners      by      the

resolution they entered into at their March 1986 meeting.                                        See

Agency Report          at     5 and      ~\otion      to Dismiss       Protest;     or   in      the

Alternative, Reply of the District of Columbia at 3 and 4.                                       DLH

contends that the commissioners cannot lawfully delegate to the

Staff     Director          the       authority       to    approve     the    removal      of     a

solicitation from the sheltered market.                           Protester's Comments on

Agency     Report        at       2    and     3.          Assuming     arguendo     that        the

commissioners          could          lawfully        delegate        such    authority,         DLH

contends that they did not do so in the resolution they passed in

March 1986.       Id. at 4 and 5.

         After its preamble language,                      the resolution of March 1986

begins:

         RESOLVED that the MBOC staff with the direction of
         the Staff Director shall assist the duly appointed
         Commissioners in performing their statutory functions
         as set forth in D.C. Code, Sec. 1-1149 (1981) by
         performing the following tasks and making appropriate
         action recommendations to the Commission.

(Emphasis added.)              Paragraph (2) of the resolution sets forth the

second task to be performed by the MBOC staff.                               It reads:

             Reviewing the procurement plans of each agency of
         the District of Columbia government and determining

~/No explanation was offered by the District as to why the
commissioners did not act on the information presented to them.

       which contracts shall be reserved for the Sheltered
       [·Iarket Program.

The   District    construes    the   two quoted provisions         together      "as

authorizing the Staff Director to perform the task of approving

or disapproving a decision by procuring officials to resolicit a

cancelled   sheltered       market     procurement    in    the   open    market."

Response of the District of Columbia to Questions Presented by

the   Contract    Appeals     Board,    Answer   a.2.      Whatever      the   exact

meaning of the two provisions is when read together, the Board is

of the view that the meaning advocated by the District does not

coexist very well with the resolution's employment of the words

"shall assist • •         by making appropriate action recommendations

to the Commission."

       In further support of its construction of the resolution,

the District offered the affidavit of the MBOC chairman presiding

at the time the resolution was passed.               Response of the District

of Columbia to Questions Presented by the Contract Appeals Board,

                                        ,. Chairman says:

       1.   I was the Chairman of the Minority Business
            Opportuni ty Commiss ion' (MBOC) from October 1980,
            to October 1987.   The resolutions adopted by the
            MBOC on March 4, 1986, delegating administrative
            duties to the MBOC Staff Director were intended
            to give the Director the authority to manage the
            day-to-day operations of the MBOC in accordance
            with D.C. Law 1-95, as amended.

       2.   The MBOC interpretation of paragraphs (2) and
            (6).~/of the attached resolution was that the
            Director correspond with contracting agencies on

       authorizing agencies to refuse to let a contract
       where it determined that bids for a particular
       contract are excessive.

             submit bids/proposals on contracts.   This inter-
             pretation includes the notion that if there are
             no certif ied HBEs to perform on a contract that
             the Director would concur with the contracting
             agency not to place a contract into the Sheltered

        3.   These resolutions were in effect at the time
             Haudine R. Cooper, Executive Director, communicate
             d her verbal approval to Bruce Marshall on the
             determination of the Department of Administrative
             Services to solicit in the open market for bids
             on the contract previously held by DLH Industries.

Irrespective of whatever deference the Board would be obliged to

give an interpretive statement of                    the MBOC Chairman,            the Board

agrees with DLH I s       view that the Chai rman' s            aff idavi t        "does not

expressly      state    that     the   Commission         delegated       to    its    Staff

Director the authority to approve agency removal of                            a contract

from the sheltered market."             Protester's Comments on the District

of    Columbia I s    Response      to Questions        Presented    by      the    Contract

Appeals Board at 3.            The Board is therefore left with a literal

reading of      the    resolution which,             in the   context of       this    case,

means that      removals of         solicitations from the sheltered market

are    to be submitted by the Staff Director to the commissioners

with an appropriate action recommendation.

         The District advances the argument that                    "~lBOC     approval is

not    required       prior    to   placing      a     cancelled    sheltered         market

solicitation in the open market."                     Response of the District of

Columbia to Questions Presented by the Contract Appeals Board,

Answer e.       In connection with this argument, the District calls

attention to the following sections of the DCPR (which currently

appear in 35 DCR, Part 2 (Feb. 26, 1988»:
                                    - 10 -


       1102.1.   If   the  contracting   officer   cancels  a
                 sheltered market solicitation for any of the
                 reasons set forth in chapters 15, 16 or 17,
                 the contracting officer shall provide a copy
                 of the determination to the MBOC in addition
                 to complying with the reporting requirements
                 of this title.

       1102.2.   After the contracting officer cancels a
                 sheltered    market     solicitation, the
                 contracting officer may resolicit in the
                 open market if the service, supply, or
                 construction is still required.

The District, without citing any authority,               states that

      [wlhile there is an apparent inconsistency between
      the above sections of the procurement regulations and
      HBOC regulations at 27 DCHR sec. 604.9, which call
      for MBOC approval of an agency's removal of a
      contract from the sheltered market, it appears that
      the procurement regulations control.       They were
      promulgated and approved by the D.C. City Council
      after   the   MBOC   regulations  and   repealed   by
      implication,   any  inconsistent  provision   in  the
      earlier MBOC regulations.

Id.

       The Board thinks       that whatever     repealing effect the DCPR

sections may     have had with      respect   to the IlBOC's      regulations,

they obviously could not have repealed them retroactively to the

time prior to the cancellation of the sheltered market invitation

and   its   removal    from   the   sheltered   market.        See   73   C.J .5.

Prospective or        Retroactive Operation     §   98.     It is quite clear

from a comparative reading of the cited DCPR sections and MBOC

regulations (which appear to still be in effect)!/ that they are

in conflict with one another on the necessity for the procuring

agency to first       obtain the MBOC's approval before cancelling a

sheltered market solicitation and resoliciting the requirement in

the open market.            In the interest of ajudicatory efficiency, this

conflict should be resolved at the earliest practicable time by

appropriate rulemaking.

         DLH alleges that the DCAPA applies to the MBOC.                             Thus,       it

argues    that   even       if    the MBOC       had approved          the    removal   of      the

sheltered     market         invitation         from      the    sheltered       market,        the

decision is void and of no effect because DLH was not afforded a

contested case hearing prior to the                        removal as         it asserts        the

DCAPA requires.         The District provided extensive argument                           as    to

why DLH's argument should not prevail.                          The short answer to DLH's

argument is that the Board does not have jurisdiction to consider

allegations of DCAPA violations because there is nothing in the

PPA   which      empowers         it     to    administer        or    enforce    the    DCAPA.

Therefore to the extent that DLH wishes to seek vindication of

any perceived violations of the DCAPA,                          it should initiate other

appropriate action.

         In sum, the Board finds that the                   ~\BOC     failed to comply with

its regulation         (§    604.9)      in connection with the               removal of the

invitation from the sheltered market for the reasons that (1) the

commissioners did not affirmatively approve                            the    removal of        the

invitation       and        (2)    the        Staff     Director's       approval       of      the

invitation's removal was without a clear delegation of authority

in the     commissioners'              resolution       of Ilarch     1986.      Although       the

Board concludes that the MBOC did not comply with its regulation

in dealing with the removal of the invitation from the sheltered

market, it does not feel that its failure warrants the relief DLH
                                             - 12 -

requests (namely, cancellation of the procurement and issuance of

a new solicitation in the sheltered market or termination of any

awarded    contract          for    the      convenience     of     the   District)        even

assuming      that     the    relief      could     be   effectively      grantd    at     this

time.     The reasons          for    this   view are      explained in the ensuing

discussion.

        Section 604.9 states that the MBOC's approval to remove a

solicitation from the sheltered market shall generally be given

only upon a showing of the following:

        (b)      That at least one attempt to solicit bids for
                 the contract in the sheltered market has failed
                 to produce an acceptable bid.

The issuance of IFB No.               7045-AA-89-0-7-HT evidences a bona fide

attempt was made             to solicit an acceptable             bid in the sheltered

market.       This attempt,          as already stated,           failed for the reason

that the sole bidder               (DLH) was determined to be nonrespons ible.

Although      the     quoted        ground    for     approving     the     removal       of     a

solicitation from the sheltered market may have been met by the

facts in a particular case, § 604.9(b) does not automatically re-

quire     that   the     commissioners         approve     the     removal.        Thus,       the

Board cannot conclusively presume that if the commissioners had

acted on the information presented to them by the Staff Director,

they would have approved the invitation's removal.                            Nonetheless,

it is observed that DLH has not given any plausible                             reason and

the Board does not discern any which would suggest that                                  if the

commissioners           had        affirmatively         acted,      they     might        have

disapproved the removal of the invitation.                          Moreover,      given the

relatively           short         period     betv18en      the      District's            final
                                        - 13 -

determination      that     DLH   was     nonresponsible            relative   to     the

sheltered     market      procurement        and    the        issuance   of   the    IFB

(approximately     1 1/2     months),        it    is    questionable     whether     DLH

would receive any benefit from a cancellation of the IFB and the

reissuance    of   an   invitation      in    the       sheltered    market.   This    is

particularly so in view of the fact that DLH did not challenge

the nonresponsibility determination before this Board.

      Accordingly, it is hereby

      ORDERED that

      1.     The District's motion to dismiss the protest is denied.

      2.     The protest is denied.
