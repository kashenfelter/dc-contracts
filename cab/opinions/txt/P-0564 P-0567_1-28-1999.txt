                                              OPINION

        In these consolidated protests, The Answer Temps, Inc. ("TAT") challenges the award of a letter
contract by the District of Columbia Public Schools ("DCPS") to [lorton and Barber Professional Services,
Inc. ("H&B") under an emergency procurement relying onl1&8's low bid price in em earlier solicitation,
which was cancelled prior to an intended award to Il&B. T/\'T contends that under the District's
emergency procurement procedures, DCPS was required to obtain competition by soliciting TAT and the
othercontraclors who submitted bids under the original (cancelled) solicitation. The District argues that
DCPS did not have adequate time to seek bids under the emergency procurement and that only H&B was
capable oftimely providing the required services. We conclude that DCPS has failed to demonstrate that
TA T or the other bidders were unable to provide the required services to meet the performance start date
tmder the emergency letter contract Because 0 [the specification changes incorporated into the emergency
procurement, it was not proper to rely on bids from the earlier solicitation. Accordingly, we sustain the
protests.



                                          BACKGROUND

        On July 24,1998, DCPS issued IFB No. DCPS-C-98219-4789-0T for a contractor to provide
370 bus drivers and 370 attendants to transport special education students lor the period October 1, 1998,
through September 30,1999. (Agency Report ("AR") Ex. 1). On July 30, 1998, TAT, the incumbent
contractor whose existing contract was to expire September 30, 1998, advised DCPS that the solicitation
omitted a wage determination for the attendants. (TAT Response to Agency Report, filed November 13,
1998, Ex. A). On August 6, 1998, DCPS notified all bidders that there "is no wage detenuination available
for 'Bus Attendants.' Bidders may bid accordingly [or this labor category." (ld., Ex. B). Five bids were
opened onAugust 10,1998. After adjusl.ing for bid preferences, ll&B had the lowest evaluated bid of
                                                                                                               [76521

                                                    -2-                The Answer Temps, CAB Nos. P-564, 567


$43,163,193.60 for the base year and two option years. TAT's evaluated bid was second low at
$43,283,473.20. (AR Ex. 6, at 2 (bid abstract)). On August 11, 1998, TAT filed with the DCI'S
contracting officer a protest of any award to H&B, I which the contracting officer purported to deny 011
September 3, 1998. (TAT Response to Agency Report, Exs. C, D). Meanwhile, the contracting officer
was preparing to award the contract to H&B. 011 September 1, 1998, the contracting officer dete1111ined
that H&B was responsible and that its prices were reasonable. (AR Ex. 4).

         On September 14, TAT filed a protest with us, docketed as CAB No. P-558, challenging any
contract award on the ground that a proper wage determination for bus attendants was not included in the
solicitation.

         On September 25, 1998, the District's ChiefPmcuremenl OHicer informed the DCPS contracting
officer that a contract award to H&B would not be approved because the 1FB specifications failed to
include the existing wage determination for bus attendants and l~liled to accurately state the munber of bus
drivers actually needed by DCI'S. (See AR Ex. 7). On the same date, September 25, 1998, the DCPS
contracting officer executed a "Determination and Findings to Enter into a Letter Contract," which slates
in pertinent part:

        Bus drivers and attendants are required for transportation of Special Education school
        children by [DCI'S]. The current contract [with TATj ... expires on September 30,
        1998. [DCPS] was moving toward award of anew contract with performance to begin
        on October 1, 1998. The solicitation ... was cancelled on the advice ofCorporat[ion]
        Counsel, leaving insufficient time for resolicitation. Reissuance of a competitive solicitation
        (Invitation [or Bids) for Bus Drivers and AUendants wiH begin immediately.

        DCPS cannot allow any disruption of these essential services. They must be provided
        under Court Order .... A Letter Contract is required to ensure continued provision of
        these judicially mandated services.

CAR Ex.

         On September 28, 1998, DCPS and H&B executed a finn fixed unit price letter contract. (AR
Ex. 10). The term of the letter contract was 30 days and compensation was nol to exceed $844,032.
DCPS indicates in the letter contract that it intends to issue a definitized contract within 30 days from the
date of award. The letter contract also provides that DCPS may authorize performance for an additional
period even if it does not definitize within the initial 30 day term. The letter contract and attachments
required H&B to provide a minimum of I 50 bus drivers and 150 attendants (aides) up to amaximum of
200 drivers and 200 attendants fc)r the period Odober 1 to October 31, 1998, and to provide a minimum


1TAT apparently was following incorrect protest procedures set forth in DCPS' solicitation. This Board,
not DCPS, is the proper forum for protests ofDCPS procurements. See A.L Eastmond & Sons, CAB
No. P-551, Sept. 9, 1998,45 D.C. Reg. 8826, 8832 11.3.

of 150 bus drivers and ISO attendants up to a maximum of370'drivers and 370 attendants for the period
November 1, 1998 to January 28, 1999. CAR Ex. 10). On the same day that the leUer contract was
signed, September 28, 1998, the DCPS contracting officer executed findings supporting a "Determination
and findings to Conduct an Emergency Procurement," which state:

       In order to ensure that there is no disruption o[these judicially mandated services, the
       Office of Contracting and Procurement for DCPS will execute a 30-day Letter Contract
       (in the amount of $832,024.00) with the low evaluated bidder, Horton aml Barber
       Professional Services (I-lorton and Barber) in the original procurement. l11is contract will
       be definitized for a total period of 120 days. DCPS wiU initiate a resolicitation of these
       requirements with a February 1, 1999 date for the inception of contract performance.

       The proposed awardee submitted the low evaluated bid (of five) in the subject competitive
       procurement and has been determined to be a responsible contractor, in that it has the
       credit and capacity to provide these required services. It has engaged drivers and
       attendants in sufficient numbers (155 and 187, respectively as of September 12,1998,
       figures which are increasing daily) to meet DCPS' minimal requirements (150 and 150,
       respectively) for October 1, 1998 commencement date. Additionally, the prices bid by
       Horton and Barber are lower than both the prices and the current contract pricing ofthe
       incumbent contractor, The Answer Temps, Inc. These minimal requirements are
       substantially greater l than] the Humber of drivers and aides currently being provided by the
       incumbent contractor. It has only been able to meet approximately one-hal f ofDCPS'
       previous driver and attendant staffing requirement, i.e., 230 and 230, respectively.

        Further competition is not practicable in view ofthe need for commencement of services
        on October 1, 1998. The drivers and attendants were required to have been trained by
        DCPS prior to performing work. Since DepS had anticipated award under the cancelled
        solicitation to the low evaluated bidder, Horton and Barber has engaged and had had
        trained the required numbers of drivers and attendants. There is presently no other firm
        that can provide the required number of drivers and attendants in time to ensure that no
        disruption oftransportation services occurs. 1Iorton and Barber stands ready, willing and
        able to begin performance with adequate personnel resources.

(AR Ex. 8 (paragraph numbers omitted)). On September 29, 1998, the Chief Procurement Officer
executed the Determination and findings.

       The DCPS contracting officer executed a statement of findings supporting a Determination and
findings to cancel the originallFI3 on September 28, 1998. The Chief Procurement Officer executed the
determination which cancelled the solicitation on September 29, 1998. CAR Ex. 7). Based on the
cancellation, TAT's protest in CAB No. P-558 was voluntarily dismissed.

        On October 16, 1998, TAT filed a new protest, docketed as CAB No. P-564, arguing that
                                                                                                              [7654]

DCPS' award ofthe letter contract to H&B was i !legal because: (1) H&B did not have a valid corporate
status because the District had revoked its corporate charter on September 8, 1998, based on H&J3' s
failure to file its Two-Year Report and to pay associated fees; (2) DCPS could not have properly
determined H&B to be a responsible bidder since it was no longer a viable corporation; (3) DCPS did not
comply with applicable sole source and emergency procurement procedures because H&B was the only
contractor that was solicited for the emergency contract, leaving out TAT, the incumbent contractor, and
the other firms that bid under the original., now-cancelled IFB. After receiving a copy ofthe September
28, 1998 Determination and Findings to Conduct an Emergency Procurement, TAT filed a supplemental
protest on October 27, 1998, challenging DCPS' findings, partic~llarly the findings that "[tlhere is presently
no other firm that can provide the required numbers of drivers and attendants in time to ensure that no
disnlption oftransportation occurs" and that "further competition is not practicable in view onhe need for
commencement of services 011 October I, 1998." On Odober 29, 1998, TAT filed another protest,
docketed as CAB No. P-567, challenging DCPS' right to extend performance ofthe emergency contract
beyond October 31, 1998.

         On November 5, 1998, the District filed its Agency Report, responding that: (1) the leHer contract
and extensions under the leHer contract are valid because Il&B 's corporate charter was retroactively
reinstated; (2) the contracting ofIicer and the District's CPO obtained the maximum competition practicable
in the emergency procurement pursuant to 27 DCMR § 1712 to provide transportation services required
by court order; (3) the responsibility determinations ancl emergency procurement findings and
delerminations were proper and supported by substantial evidence; and (4) in extending performance,
DCPS did not exercise any "option" but rather extended performance under the emergency contract
consistent with 27 DCMR § 2425.9.

        Although a draft definitized contract was prepared by DCPS, it was never signed by the parties.
(See, e.g., AR Ex. 13, 17-18). By modification ofthe letter contract executed on October 28, 1998,
performance was extended through November 30, 1998, with a requirement "for up to 250 school bus
drivers ... and up to 250 attendants .... " CAR Ex. j 8). By modification of the letter contract executed
on November 30, 1998, performance was extended through December 30, 1998, with a requirement "for
up to 275 school bus drivers ... and up to 275 attendants .... " (District's December 7, 1998 filing). By
modification ofthe letter contract executed on December 29, 1998, performance was extended through
January 28,1999, with a requirement "for up to 370 school bus drivers ... and up to 370 attendants ... "
(District's Januaty 1] , 1999 fil iug). The modifications have collective! y extended performance under the
letter contract through January 28, 1999, at which time the emergency contract expires.

                                              DISCUSSION

        We exercise protest jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code § 1-1189.3 (Supp. 1998).

       The key issue presented by the protests is whether the District properly conducted an emergency
procurement by negotiating an emergency letter contract with 1l&J3, based on the bids submitted in
connection with the original, but later cancelled, solicitation, withoutresoliciting either the incumbent
                                                                                                                (7655)

contractor, TAT, or any onhe other three contractors who submitted a bid under the original solicitation.

        l11e Procurement Practices Act requires that emergency procurements "shall be made vvith as much
competition as is maximally practicable under the circumstances." D. C. Code § 1-1183.12. 111e District's
regulations governing emergency procurement procedures states:

        The contracting officer shall attempt to solicit offers or proposals from as many potential
        contractors as possi bIe under the emergency condition. An emergency procurement shall
        not be made on a sole source basis unless the emergency D&F includes justification for the
        sole source procurement, in accordance \vith § 1705.

27 DCMR § 1712.3.

         l11e District relies on the findings made by the DCPS contracting officer that no competition beyond
the competitive bidding under the original (later cancelled) solicitation was practicable because: (a) H&B
had engaged and trained the required number of bus drivers and attendants; (b) DCPS had trained the
H&B bus drivers and attendants; (c) H&B had the lowest bid prices for the services under the cancelled
solicitation; and (d) no other contractor could provide the required number of drivers and attendants and
meet all of the necessary transportation requirements by the October 1, 1998 start date.

         We find that the contracting officer's finding - that no other contractor could provide the required
number of drivers and attendants and meet all oftbe necessary transportation requirements - is unsuppOlted
by the record. The letter contract required the contractor to provide a minimum of 150 drivers and
attendants up to a maximum of200 drivers and attendants. First, DCPS never contacted either TAT or
any ofthe other three contractors to determine whether they could supply the numbers required by the
letter contract, amounts substantially lower than the number of drivers and attendants required by the
original solicitation. Indeed, one ofthe problems with the original solicitation was that it overstated DCPS'
actual driver and. attendant need.s. Second, TAT was the incumbent contractor providing the same services
and it was TAT's contract that was expiring on September 30, ,j 998. As ofSeplember Ii, 1998, TAT
states that it was providing 176 drivers and by September 28, 1998, TAT was providing 195 drivers.
                                                                          'i'i
(TAT Supplemental Protest, Ex. C, Corrected Decl. Of Allene Graves 4-5). During the same period,
TAT was providing 154 attendants. (TAT Response to Agency Report, Ex. E, '1'18-9). In rebuttal, the
District states that TAT had been providing between 144 and 167 drivers and between 112 and l40
attendants during September 1998. (District Response, filed November 25,' 1998, Ex. 1). The problem
with the District's position is that TAT was providing the number of drivers and attendants as requested
by DCPS. Significantly, the DCPS contracting officer made his September 1, 1998 determination of
H&B's responsibility contingent on "H&B' s providing lists of at least 150 qualified drivers and 150
attendants by September 12, 1998." (TAT Supplemental Protest, Ex. C (DecI. Ex. A)). Indeed, many
ofH&B 's expected drivers and attendants were being recruited from the ranks ofTAT employees. Thus,
the record shows that H&B and TAT were recruiting [rom a similar pool and that TAT was at least as
capable as H&B in obtaining the necessary drivers and attendants for an emergency contract to begin
October 1, 1998.
                                                                                                                [7656]

         We also cannot sustain the contracting officer's finding that!it was not practicable to obtain some
limited competition under an emergency procurement and still meet an October 1, 1998 start date. By no
later than September 25, 1998, the DCPS contracting officer.Imew the original solicitation would be
cancelled. Having held a competition for the long-term requirements with bids opened just over a month
earlier, DCPS could have issued an emergency solicitation, received bids, made the required
determinations, and issued an award for performance starting October 1. Moreover, DCPS was itself
responsible for the time constraints caused by its failure to remedy the solicitation defects which were made
known to it even before bids were opened on the original solicitation.

         The District cites Trifax Corp., CAB Nos. P-194, P-197, July 9, 1991,39 D.C. Reg. 4253, in
support of the DCPS decision to limit the emergency procurement to negotiating with H&B without any
additional competition beyond that provided by the original, and later cancelled solicitation. In Trijclx,
where the incumbent contractor defaulted, and same day service was needed, we found limiting competition
to a database listing of current providers of the needed services met the requirement for maximum
practicable competition under the emergency procedures required by 27 DCMR § 1712.3 where the
contracting officer considered the necessity of the services, the known qualities ofthe contractor, the
contractor's familiarity with the services to be provided, and the reasonableness ofthe price. In contrast
to the situation in Trifax, here the only incunlbent contractor, TAT, was not even solicited for a bid on the
short-term emergency procurement. More importantly, DCPS did not conduct any limited competition
under the emergency procurement with the five bidders but simply negotiated a letter contract with H&B.

                                            CONCLUSION

        In sum, DCPS erred in negotiating an emergency contract with H&B without soliciting competition
from the other bidders, including at a minimum, TAT, the incumbent contractor. There is no evidence in
the record to support the DCPS finding that only H&B could supply the required drivers and attendants
for an October 1, 1998 performance start date. When considering the important changes made to the
requirements for the emergency procurement, DCPS erred in relying on the bids from the cancelled
solicitation. The consolidated protests are sustained on these grounds. 2
