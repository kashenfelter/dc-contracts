   DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA’S OPPOSITION TO PROTESTER’S RESPONSE TO THE
         DISTRICT’S MOTION TO CORRECT OPINION AND REQUEST FOR
              RECONSIDERATION OF ORDER DENYING PROTESTS

       Pursuant to 27 DCMR 110, 49 DCR 2089 (March 8, 2002), the District of Columbia

respectfully moves for leave to respond to “Protester’s Response to the District’s Motion to

Correct Opinion and Request for Consideration of Order Denying Protest” (“Response”). On

October 23, 2006, the District filed its “Motion of the District of Columbia Requesting the

Contract Appeals Board to Correct an Omission of Fact in the Board’s October 16, 2006,

Opinion Denying Protests” (“District’s Motion”), since it appears that the October 16, 2006,

“Opinion Denying Protests” (“Opinion”) contains an omission of fact which prompted the

recommendation of the Contract Appeals Board (“Board”) that the contracting officer should

have sought new bids given the nine-month delay on award and the denial of TAC’s

certification. In its Response, protester totally misconstrues the District’s Motion and requests

the Board to reconsider and correct its Opinion because the Board “omits facts critical to the

resolution of these consolidated cases.” (Opposition, page 1). However, the District is not

requesting the Board to make a finding of fact or to overturn its decision. The District is merely

requesting the Board to include the undisputed missing fact in its Opinion and clarify its

statement regarding the need for the contracting officer to cancel a solicitation and reprocure
                                                 1
services in the event of a nine month delay and a denial of LSDBE certification prior to award.

Since the District’s contracting officers take seriously any recommendation of the Board that

may affect the conduct of future procurements, the District is merely seeking clarification of the

Board’s statement regarding the need to cancel a solicitation and reprocure under facts that were

omitted from the Board’s decision.

       Accordingly, we request that the Board deny the protester’s Response. In addition, we

request the Board to correct its Opinion by including the undisputed omitted fact that on

February 16, 2006, the SBLOC recertified TAC until February 16, 2008, as a small,

disadvantaged local DZE business entitled to 9 preference points.

                                             Respectfully submitted,

                                             ROBERT SPAGNOLETTI
