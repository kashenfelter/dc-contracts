        Appellant, A n A, Incorporated C'A n A") a Dislnct of Columbia towing and stoiage
company, alleges that its multi-yeai contiact to provide services to the Metropolitan Police
Depaitment ("MPD") was breached when MPD piematuiely teimmated the contract alter only
seven months The Distuct filed a Motion to Dismiss aiguing that (1) the "base yeaf of the
contiact lan only from the date of award through Scptembei 30, 1997, (2) the contiact was
teimmated in a timely fashion and (3) the Distucl would have been in violation of the Anti-
Deficiency Act had it obligated funds past the base year ending on Septembei 30, 1997 We
grant the District's Motion to Dismiss on alternative grounds The RFP and subsequent
contract contained two piovisions that were patently ambiguous concerning the meaning of
base year Based on the doctrine of patent ambiguity, a duty aiose in A n A , the non-dialling
party, to seek clarification of the meaning of the teim "base yeaf pnoi to bidding A n A
failed to seek such clarification, and accoidingly we deny its claim

                                     BACKGROUND

        In Octobci of 1996, MPD issued two Requests foi Pioposals Ibi "No Cost" l o w i n g
Services ("RTP") The RFPs weie identical except that one was designated foi Patiol Aiea
Noith and one for Patrol Aiea South At issue in this appeal is the RFP issued foi Patiol Aiea
South The RFP sought a contractoi to piovide "towing, storage and miscellaneous wieckei
'load' seivices 0 Lim P start, gas, tire changes, winch woik, etc ) to designated vehicles that
are determined to be in need of such seivicc by the Distucl of Columbia Metiopohtan Police
Depaitment " on a 24 hour basis The towing seivices weie sought by MPD foi a vanety of
situations, including the towing of automobiles that had been in accidents, iccoveicd stolen
cais, icmoval of cars from resti ictcd rush hour aieas The contiact was captioned a "no-cost"
contract in that the owneis of the cats would pay for the towing and storage fees at the time
                                             -2-                    An I, lacoipoialed, CAB No D-1022


that they iclrieved their cais However, Section 10 of the RFP provides that should the MFD
itself eleet to use the services of the conliactor that the costs would be boinc by MPD The
RFP lequiied all bidders to have a facility capable of stonng a minimum of 175 vehicles and
possess at least ten tow trucks

        On January 15, 1997, A n A enteied into Contiact No FA5043 IS with the District of
Columbia to piovide towing sei vices foi Patrol Aiea South The contiact was ibi a base ycai
and foui one year options A n A leceived virtually no calls relating to the contiact until
Febiuary 17, 1997, when then-Chief of Police Lany D Soulsby issued "Special Ordei 97-1"
to infoim all police officers of the existence of the towing contiacts Special Oidei 97-1
piovides that "[t]he principal benefit of the contiact is that iccovcied stolen vehicles will be
towed to the contiactois impound lot at no charge to the depaitment. Under certain, veiy
specific circumstances the towing contractois may be tequested to provide sei vices to the
department on a chargeable basis " From February 17, 1997, until September 30, 1997, A n
A derived $220,967 in icvenue or $29,463 on aveiage for the 7 !/2 months By lettei dated
August 14, 1997, Chief Soulsby informed A n A that MPD had elected "not to extend the
contiact beyond the base year which expires September 30, 1997 This is in accordance with
Page 11,Section 7 0, item 4, of the aforementioned contract "

       A n A filed a breach of contract claim with the Board on October 24, 1997, claiming
$132,583 in damages for lost revenue alleging that MPD had impermissibly teiminated the
contract befoie the end of the first full yeai term A n A claims that the effective stait date of
the contiact was Febiuaiy 17, 1997, and lan until Febiuaiy 16, 1998 A n A based its claim on
§ 7 3 of the contiact which states "The initial leim ol this contiact is one yeai '"

        On June 26, 1998, the Distnct filed a Motion to Dismiss aiguing that the Distnct
piopeily teiminated the contiact aftei less than a full yeai The Distiict contends that A n A's
asseilion that the base year contiact term was for a one-yeai tenn from the effective start date
is enoneous The District points out that § 6 0 of the contiact, Fee Suuctme and Schedule,
defines the base year as the "Date of award through September 30, 1997" and each of the
option yeais as running from Octobei I through Septembei 30 of the following year The
Disti id contends that the meaning of §7 3 can only be haimonized with the lest of the contiact
if the term year in §7 3 meant icmamdei of the fiscal yeai The Distnct then postulates that
even if the § § 7 3 and 6 0 cannot be reconciled, the detailed definition of the base year set forth
in §6 0 should control over the general statement set forth in §7 3 Fuithei, the Distnct
maintains that the contract was structuied to avoid violating the Anti-Deficiency Act by
establishing an end date of September 30, 1997. The District also asserts that in accordance
with §7 4 of the contract, MPD gave A n A the requisite 45-day written notice that it would not
exercise the second year option

       On July 23. 1998, A n A filed an Opposition to the Distnct's Motion to Dismiss A n

                          7
A contends that §6 0, which defines the base year as the date of award through Septembei 30,
1997, is too vague and non-specific to indicate when the contiact would commence, and undei
the District's inteipietation the term of the contiact could be two months 01 only a lew days
A n A argues that it is unrealistic to "believe that Appellant, or any contractoi, would invest
huge sums of money for equipment and licenses and, specific storage space, as requiied by the
contiact, for a contract in which the beginning and termination dates rested solely upon the
discretion of the MPD A n A states that MPD created furthei confusion by awaiding the
contract on January 15, 1998 and then establishing an effective date of February 17, 1998 A
n A aigues that the contract is ambiguous as to the meaning of the length of the fust yeai and
that the provision should be constiued against MPD as the drafter of the contiact Finally, A
n A argues that the contract was foi no cost to the District and no appiopi lated funds were used
in the implementation of the contract A n A also points out that as soon as this contiact was
terminated on September 30, 1997, MPD immediately issued anothet senes of contracts to
other towing companies

       At the paities request, a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss was held on September 30,
1998

                                          DECISION

        This appeal can be disposed of thiough consideiation of the doctime of patent
ambiguities Generally, under the rule of contra proferentem, the drafter of a contract which
contains latent ambiguities will have the ambiguous provision construed against it so long as
the non-drafting party's interpretation is reasonable and the non-drafting party has reasonably
relied on its interpretation Newsom v United Slates, 230 Ct Cl 301(1982) Fiowevei, an
exception to the rule exists if the ambiguity is patent Id When an ambiguity is patent 01
glaring, a duty arises for the non-drafting party to i n q u n e concerning the ambiguity prior to
contracting Fry v United Stales, 22 Cl Ct 497, 503 (1991) The doctrine of patent
ambiguity prevents contiactois fiom taking advantage of the Government by inteipietmg
contract provisions to their own benefit when they know, or should know of an enoi in the
solicitation prior to bidding SOG of Arkansas v United Stales, 212 Ct Cl 125 (1972)
If a contractor fails to conduct such an inquiry, a patent ambiguity will be resolved against the
contractor. Id The test is not the actual knowledge of the ambiguity by the contractoi. but
whether the inconsistency is plain and glaring The inconsistency cannot be subtle, but must
be "an obvious en or in drafting, a gioss discrepancy, or an inadvertent but glaring gap v WPC
Enterprises, Inc v United States, 163 Ct Cl 1, 6 (1963)

       Based on the circumstances of this case, it is abundantly clear that the two sections
defining the length of the initial contract yeai are facially inconsistent, raising the duty of
inquiry regardless of how reasonable the contractor's interpretation was Section 6 0 of the
RFP, which provided prospective contractors with the annual rate schedule for each anticipated
                                                    -4-                   A n A, Incoi pointed, CAB No D-1022

        service, and the estimated number of annual incidents, required prospective conti actors to fill
        in the percentage of the fees which it would pay to MPD for the base year and the foiu option
        yeais The following caption appears on page 9] of the RFP just above the area where the
        prospective bidder was to fill in the peicentage of rebate "Base Year: Date of award
        through September 30, 1997." (Emphasis in the onginal) On pages 10 and 11, the option
        yeais are specifically descnbed as beginning on October 1 and ending on September 30 of the
        following yeai In contrast to § 6 0, §7 3, entitled CONTRACT SCHEDULE, provides "The
        initial term of this contract is one (1) year " If the RFP had been issued prior to October 1997,
        the two sections could have been read in harmony However, the RFP was not issued until
        sometime during the month of October 1997, so that even if the contract award occuired
        within a few days of the issuance of the RFP, there would have been less than a one-yeai
        period befoie the end of the base year as defined in §6 0 and the beginning of the expressly-
        defined, first year option. We find that Sections 6 0 and 7 3 aie so glaringly inconsistent that
    *   A n A had a duty to inquire about the length of the base yeai before submitting its bid,
        icgaidless of the leasonableness of its interpretation As we have resolved this mattei based
        on the doctrine of patent ambiguity, we have no need to address the parties' other issues

            We therefore GRANT the District's Motion to Dismiss.                  Appellant's claim is
»       DENIED
