                                            OPINION

        On    October       30,    1987,     the      Department    of    Administrative
Services      (DAS)      issued Invitation for Bids No.              8102-AA-75-0-8-GL
(IFB)    in the          sheltered market          for     paper and other stationary
products.          At the bid opening on December 16,                    1987,      four bids
were received in response to the IFB, including those of systems
Products,       Inc.      (Systems)       and Gray Paper Co.         (Gray).        Gray was
found to be the apparent low bidder.
        On February 7,            1988,    systems filed this protest with the
Board 1 challenging DAS' consideration of Gray for contract award
under        the    IFB     because        Gray       is   not   eligible      to     bid   on
solicitations in the sheltered market.                           Systems alleges that:
Gray     does      not    own     or   lease      a    plant,    warehouse,      or    office

     1This case originated during the period when the District
of Columbia Contract Appeals Board was functioning pursuant to
Commissioner's Order No.9, D.C. Code, Supplement V (1987), as
amended by Mayor's Order 86-65, 33 DCMR 3006 (May 16, 1986).
Pursuant to the D.C. Procurement Practices Act of 1985 (Act),
D.C. Code, sec. 1-1189.1 (1987 Replacement), a new independent
agency denominated as the Contract Appeals Board was created.
This new Board became operational on August 1, 1988, and
succeeded to the jurisdiction of all cases before the previously
established Board.

facility; it does not possess shipping and delivery capabilities;

and it is "acting as a middleman between ineligible individual

suppl iers of paper."       See the protest,         page    2.       Thus,    Systems

contends, Gray is not a qualified minority business enterprise to

bid on this    solicitation.         systems Products requests that the

eligibility    of    Gray   be    thoroughly      investigated,       the     contract

award be delayed until Gray's eligibility as a minority business
enterprise can be determined, and the contract be awarded to the

lowest responsive and responsible bidder.                  systems also requests

that the Board award it bid preparation costs and attorney fees.

      At the time this protest was               filed no contract award had

been made and the bids received in response to the solicitation,
including those of both Gray and Systems, were being evaluated. 2

      In past decisions this Board has held that in order for a

bidder to have a       cognizable and viable protest such that the

Board will have       jurisdiction,       the bidder must be aggrieved in

connection    with   the    solicitation        or award    of    a   contract.      A

bidder is aggrieved when it suffers a loss or injury or when a
legal right it has is violated by the act complained of.                           See
Protest of A.A. Beiro Construction Company, Inc., 1 P.D. 60 (D.C.
CAB 1987); Protest of Emergency One,               Inc.,    CAB No.     P-114    (D.C.
CAB   November 2, 1988).         Systems has failed to show that it is an

aggrieved party.      The mere submission of a nonresponsive bid by



     2since the filing of this protest, DAS has determined that
Gray was in fact not a certified MBE at the time of bid opening.
Accordingly, Gray's bid was rejected as nonresponsive.

     Gray does not have an injurious impact on systems or any other
     bidder.   No official agency action adverse to systems has been

     taken.    Absent such an action,       this protest is premature and
     speculative.        Therefore,   the       Board   lacks    the   requisite
     jurisdiction to hear and decide this protest on the merits.
          Accordingly,      the   protest       is   dismissed   for   lack   of
     jurisdiction.
                                      ORDER
          This protest is denied.
