                                            OPINION
                                          Filing ID 30054064


        American Consultants & Management Enterprises, Inc. (“ACME”) participated in a joint
venture with Capitalcare, Inc. (“CCI”), which contracted with the District to provide comprehensive
outpatient substance abuse treatment services. ACME appeals the contracting officer’s final decision
denying its claim for District funds paid to CCI and for payment resulting from an unjustified sole
source contract award to CCI. The District has moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the
complaint fails to state a claim for which relief can be granted, and that the appeal was untimely
filed. ACME did not respond to the District’s motion. We conclude that the appeal was untimely
filed pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.04(a). Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.

                                        BACKGROUND

        On July 17, 1995, CCI/ACME Joint Venture executed contract number JA/93584 with the
District’s Department of Human Services (“DHS”) to provide comprehensive outpatient substance
abuse treatment services for 360 alcohol or chemically dependent adults. The term of the contract
was from July 25, 1995, to July 23, 1996, with four one year options. (Appeal File (“AF”) Ex. 3,
Attachment A). All options were exercised by DHS, so that CCI/ACME provided services through
July 24, 2000. (AF Ex. 3, at 2).

     The CCI/ACME joint venturers, Capitalcare and ACME, executed a letter of dissolution on
December 23, 1998, stating in part:

             [I]t is mutually agreed upon that effective 12/25/98, Capitalcare Inc. will take
       complete responsibility of execution and administration of the DHS Contract #
       JA93584. ACME Inc. and all its corporate officers . . . relinquish all rights to
       CCI/ACME JOINT VENTURE DHS contract # JQA93584. It is further agreed upon
                                                -2-                        ACME, Inc., CAB No. D-1258



       that for the remaining length of the contract CCI will pay to ACME $4,341.00 per
       month.

              Starting Dec. 25th, 1998’s invoice, [e]ach month, when the monies are
       received from DC Government for the services rendered, CCI will pay to ACME
       $4,341.00 to ACME.

(AF Ex. 3, Attachment B). There is no evidence in the record that the contract was modified to
reflect a novation. (AF Ex. 3, at 3).

        The contract expired on July 24, 2000. According to a 2003 report of the District’s Inspector
General, between July 25 and September 25, 2000, CCI continued to provide outpatient substance
abuse treatment services without a written contract to do so. (AF Ex. 3, at 3). CCI received two
payments for services provided during this period. (Id.). On September 26, 2000, CCI and District
entered into a one year sole source contract, POHC-2000-C0036, to provide continuing substance
abuse services. (Id.).

       On February 22, 2004, ACME, by letter to Mr. Jacques Abadie, III, the District’s Chief
Procurement Officer, asserted claims related to the original ACME/CCI contract and the CCI sole
source contract. The contracting officer, Ms. Esther Scarborough, responded with a final decision
dated June 4, 2004, sent certified mail, return receipt requested, denying ACME’s claim for relief
sought against the District for payments made to CCI under the above referenced contracts, stating in
pertinent part:

               Issue #1. You have requested $15,513 in compensation out of $89,342.36
       paid to [CCI/ACME] for outpatient substance abuse treatment services performed
       between July 25, 2000 and September 25, 2000. Despite the fact that the Inspector
       General found the District paid CCI/ACME for these services beyond the period of
       the written contract, No. JA/93584, CCI/ACME was the actual entity performing the
       services and full payment was rendered to it. Therefore, any amount that may be
       owed to you out of that payment is a matter between you and CCI/ACME.

               Issue #2. You have claimed $52,504 on account of a sole source contract,
       No. POHC -2000-C-0036 that was awarded to CCI on September 25, 2000 for the
       same services. Because the Inspector General concluded . . . that the procurement as
       a sole source contract was unjustified, you assert that your company, ACME, should
       have been entitled to a share of the amount due under that contract. In no way does
       the determination that the sole source contract was not justified give rise to an
       entitlement of payment to you in lieu of payment under that contract. To approve
       payment to you without a contract would be tantamount to the District’s authorizing
       an oral contract, which is the same violation for which the Inspector General cited the
       Office of Contracting and Procurement as to Issue Number 1. . . .
                                                  -3-                          ACME, Inc., CAB No. D-1258



                ....

                This is the final decision of the Contracting Officer. In accordance with D.C.
        Official Code § 2-309.04, you may appeal this decision within 90 days from the date
        of receipt to the Contract Appeals Board . . . .

(AF” Ex.1). ACME does not contend that it received the June 4, 2004 final decision in an untimely
manner. (Notice of Appeal, at 2). On February 22, 2005, ACME filed its notice of appeal, dated
February 17, 2005, with the Board, and amended its factual statement on March 1, 2005. Although
the appeal lacks clarity, it is without question an appeal of the contracting officer’s June 4, 2004 final
decision. On April 1, 2005, the District filed a motion to dismiss. ACME did not respond to the
District’s motion to dismiss.

                                            DISCUSSION

        We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03(a)(2).

        The contracting officer’s final decision was issued on June 4, 2004. ACME’s notice of
appeal of the final decision was received by the Board 261 days later on February 22, 2005. The
Procurement Practices Act, in D.C. Code § 2-309.04 (“Contractor’s right of appeal to Board”), sets
forth a time limit for appealing to the Board a contracting officer’s final decision:

    (a) Except as provided in § 2-308.05, within 90 days from the date of receipt of a
        decision of the contracting officer, the contractor may appeal the decision to the
        Board.

As the appeal was filed long after the appeal period mandated by the statute, we must dismiss the
appeal as untimely. Accordingly, we dismiss ACME’s appeal with prejudice.

        SO ORDERED.

DATED: March 15, 2010                                    /s/ Jonathan D. Zischkau
