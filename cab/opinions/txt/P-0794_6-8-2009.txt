                                          OPINION
                                        Filing ID 25533320


        Protester CNA Corporation challenges the contracting officer’s determination that
CNA’s bid was nonresponsive for failure to submit a bid bond with good and sufficient
sureties as required by the bond requirements of the solicitation. The District filed a motion
to dismiss the protest as untimely, alleging that CNA filed its protest more than 10 days after
it knew, or should have known, of the basis for its protest. On the merits, the District asserts
that the contracting officer properly rejected CNA’s bid as nonresponsive since CNA
submitted with its bid an unacceptable bid guaranty. We agree with the District that CNA’s
protest was untimely. Accordingly, we dismiss the protest.

                                      BACKGROUND

       The District’s Office of Contracting and Procurement, on behalf of the District’s
Department of Transportation, issued Solicitation No. DCKA-2009-B-0022 in September
2008 for the rehabilitation of three bridges over the C&O Canal in Georgetown. (AR Ex. 1).
Seven bids were received and opened on October 22, 2008 (AR at 3; AR Ex. 3). CNA was
the apparent low bidder. CNA’s bid included as bid guaranty a non-certified company check
drawn on Sun Trust Bank in the name of “Cheeks of North, Inc.” CNA submitted no other
evidence of any bid guaranty in its bid package. Section 102, Article 12, Bond Requirements,
Bid Guaranty of the Standards and Specifications for Highways and Structures (2005),
incorporated by reference into the IFB (page v of the IFB) provides as follows:

       On all bids of $100,000.00 or more, security is required to insure the execution
       of the contract. No bid will be considered unless it is so guaranteed. Each
       bidder must furnish with his bid either a bid bond (Form 2640-5) with good
       and sufficient sureties, a certified check payable to the Treasurer of the District
       of Columbia (uncertified check will not be accepted), negotiable United States
       bond (at par value), or an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount not less than
       five percent (5) of the amount of his bid . . . .
                                               -2-              CNA Corporation, CAB No. P-0794


(AR Ex. 1).

        By Determination and Finding dated November 26, 2008, the Chief Procurement
Officer approved an award to other than the low bidder. The D&F recommended award to the
second low bidder. (AR Ex. 4). On December 2, 2008, the contracting officer notified CNA
that the CNA bid had been rejected as non-responsive. (AR Ex. 5). On December 31, 2008,
CNA filed its protest. The District filed a motion to dismiss the protest as untimely on
January 22, 2009. CNA has not responded to the motion.

                                       DISCUSSION

       We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03(a)(1).

        We begin by addressing the issue of whether CNA timely filed its protest. The
District asserts that CNA filed its protest more than 10 business days after December 2, 2008,
the date the contracting officer notified CNA that its bid had been rejected as non-responsive.
(AR Ex. 5). The District asserts that because CNA knew that the District had rejected CNA’s
bid on December 2, 2008 (or December 5, 2008, after allowing three days for mail delivery),
CNA should have filed its protest within 10 business days of that date, that is, by December
19, 2008.

        D.C. Code § 2-309.08 (b)(2) requires the protester to file a protest not later than 10
business days after the basis of the protest is known or should have been known, whichever is
earlier. CNA does not challenge the District’s assertion that it informed CNA of the bid
rejection on December 2, 2008. Because CNA failed to submit its protest within 10 business
days after December 2, 2008, its protest is untimely. Accordingly, we dismiss the protest.

       SO ORDERED.
