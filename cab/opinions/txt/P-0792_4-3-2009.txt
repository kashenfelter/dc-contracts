                                         OPINION
                                       Filing ID 24511793


        In a protest filed with the Board on November 9, 2008, protester Horton & Barber
Construction Services, Inc., challenges the nonresponsibility determination made by the
contracting officer on October 24, 2008. Horton further alleges that the contracting officer
failed to respond to Horton’s request for informal discussions in accordance with 27 DCMR §
3801.1. The District in its agency report responds that Horton’s bid contained an inadequate
bid guaranty, thereby rendering the bid nonresponsive, and that Horton’s bid was
unreasonably below the government estimate, rendering the bidder nonresponsible. We agree
with the District that Horton’s bid was nonresponsive. Further, we agree that Horton has not
demonstrated with adequate evidence that the contracting officer erred in finding Horton
nonresponsible based on an unreasonably low price. Accordingly, we deny the protest.

                                     BACKGROUND

        The District’s Office of Contracting and Procurement, on behalf of the Department of
Transportation, issued Solicitation No. DCKA-2008-B-0097 in May 2008, for the demolition
and removal of the existing ramp bridges for Ramps SE and ES at the interchange of 11th
Street and the Southeast Freeway. (Agency Report (“AR”) at 2). The ramps provide access
to the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium from the freeway. Eight bids were submitted on
July 24, 2008. Horton was the apparent low bidder with a price of $504,619.50. The next
low bid was Milani Construction, LLC, with a price of $1,871,180. The remaining bids
ranged from $2,599,199 to $4,957,263.50. (AR Ex. 5). The District’s initial estimate for the
job was $5,764,730 but that estimate was later revised to $1,904,990 when the statement of
work was amended to remove the requirement that certain materials removed from the bridges
under the contract be salvaged and delivered to the District. (AR at 3). Horton’s bid guaranty
included a bid bond underwritten by Infinity Surety of Saginaw, Texas. The asset pledged by
Infinity Surety to support the bond was a parcel of land identified as “Lot 20, Block 7,
Woodmont addition, an addition to the City of Fort Worth, Texas.” (AR at 5, AR Ex. 2).
                                               -2-              Horton & Barber, CAB No. P-0792


Horton did not provide any other documentation or details about the pledged parcel of land
with its bid. By letter dated July 25, 2008, the contracting officer requested that Horton
confirm its bid price. (AR at 3). The contracting officer did not request that Horton provide
cost data supporting the pricing of the various line items found in its bid. On July 29, 2008,
Horton confirmed its bid price. (AR Ex. 4). Horton did not provide any cost data supporting
the pricing of the solicitation’s line items. On August 6, a bid opening transmittal letter was
forwarded to Barton Clark, who is the program manager for the District’s Anacostia
Waterfront Initiative, requesting a recommendation for award and a justification for the
disparity between the bid prices and the government’s estimate. (AR at 3-4). On August 7,
the contracting officer received from the program management office a recommendation to
award to the second low bidder, Milani Construction. (AR at 4).

        On October 24, 2008, the contracting officer approved a Determination and Findings
(D&F) to reject the Horton’s bid for an unreasonably low price. (AR Ex. 3). One major
portion of the work consisted of bridge demolition over an active railroad facility, M Street
and the SE/SW Expressway. The contracting agency notes that the demolition and removal of
the bridges’ superstructures/substructures is both labor and equipment intensive. The
contracting officer concluded that Horton could not perform this complex portion of the work
for its unit price of $250,000. The next low bidder had a price of $1,090,000 for this same
work. For mobilization, Horton bid $30,000, while the average price of the eight bidders is
$106,937.50 and the government estimate is $100,000. For the construction lane closing line
item, Horton bid $10,000 while the average price for this bid item was $107,312.50 and the
government estimate is $50,000. For the protection shield line item needed to protect public
and CSX property during demolition, Horton bid $20,000 while the next low bidder’s price
was $185,000, a difference of $165,000. According to the contracting agency, improper or ill
prepared plans can result in project delays and/or a danger to public safety. (AR at 7-8; AR
Exs. 2, 3, and 7).

        Also on October 24, 2008, the District’s Chief Procurement Officer approved the D&F
to award the contract to Milani Construction. (AR Ex. 5). By letter dated October 29, 2008,
the contracting officer informed Horton that it had been determined to be nonresponsible due
to an unreasonably low bid price. (AR Ex. 6). On November 9, 2008, Horton filed this
protest. On December 1, 2008, the District filed its Agency Report arguing that (1) Horton’s
bid was nonresponsive because the bid bond was defective, and (2) Horton was properly
determined to be nonresponsible because its bid price was unreasonably low pursuant to 27
DCMR §§ 1531.6 and 2200.5. On December 19, 2008, Horton filed its comments on the
Agency Report and included an affidavit from Horton’s CEO, Herman W. Barber, III. Horton
argues that the contracting officer acted in bad faith in making his nonresponsibility
determination without requesting Horton to provide support for its pricing and to otherwise
obtain the required types of responsibility information set forth in 27 DCMR § 2204.1 –
2204.5. Mr. Barber states in his affidavit that he “received price commitments from buyers of
steel, concrete and other salvage materials identified in the ‘Summary of Quantities’ list
provided in the solicitation. For example . . . a per ton price of $365.00 for steel.” (Barber
Affidavit ¶ 6). He adds: “I used all of the price quotes received and salvage value research I
obtained to help determine my solicitation bid price.” (Barber Affidavit ¶ 7). After bid
opening, Barber states that he confirmed his bid price but that the contracting officer “never
                                                -3-               Horton & Barber, CAB No. P-0792


requested that I verify, justify or explain my bid price” and “did not respond to any of my
additional attempts to inquire about the need to extend my bid bond or provide any additional
information.” (Barber Affidavit ¶¶ 9-11).

       The District awarded the contract to Milani Construction on March 5, 2009. (Contract
No. DCKA-2008-C-0097, filed March 26, 2009). The contract price matches Milani’s bid
price of $1,871,180 and Milani executed performance and payments bonds as part of the
contract.

                                        DISCUSSION

       We exercise jurisdiction over this protest pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-309.03(a)(1).

       The District argues that Horton submitted an inadequate bid bond, and thus its bid is
nonresponsive. Horton argues that the contracting officer failed to identify the alleged bid
bond defect and that the District is estopped from raising it for the first time in its Agency
Report. We conclude that the District was not estopped from raising the bid bond issue in the
Agency Report and that the bond was defective, rendering Horton’s bid nonresponsive. The
IFB required bidders to provide a bid guaranty for 90 calendar days after bid opening. (AR
Ex. 1). Horton submitted a bid bond that contained a pledge of real estate described as “Lot
20, Block 7, Woodmont addition, an addition to the City of Fort Worth, Texas.” (AR at 5,
AR Ex. 2). Horton provided no other information about the real estate with its bid.

       The sufficiency of a bid bond depends on whether the surety is clearly bound by the
bond and whether the government will receive the full and complete protection contemplated
by the government if the bidder fails to execute the required contract documents. Fort Myer
Constr. Corp., CAB No. P-0452, July 23, 1996, 44 D.C. Reg. 6476, 6481; Communications
by Johnson, Inc., B-255478, Mar. 2, 1994, 94-1 CPD ¶ 163; Gulf & Texas Trading Co., B-
253991, Jan. 24, 1994, 94-1 CPD ¶ 31. If the surety’s liability is not clear from the face of the
bond, the bond is defective and must be rejected as nonresponsive. See Gulf & Texas Trading
Co., B-253991, Jan. 24, 1994, 94-1 CPD ¶ 31; H.R. General Maintenance Corp., CAB No. P-
0557, Feb. 2, 1999, 44 D.C. Reg. 8556, 8560. Horton’s bond did not include an appraisal of
the property. Therefore, the contracting officer could not determine the value of the secured
property, and he could not determine whether the property had the value needed to support the
value of Horton’s bid. Accordingly, the bid bond was defective. Communications by
Johnson, Inc., B-255478, Mar. 2, 1994, 94-1 CPD ¶ 163; Gulf & Texas Trading Co., B-
253991, Jan. 24, 1994, 94-1 CPD ¶ 31.

        Horton cites no authority, and we can find none, for concluding that the contracting
agency should be estopped from rendering such a determination four months after bid opening
and three months before award to the second low bidder. Computer Terminal Sales, B-
200366, Jan. 22, 1981, 81-1 CPD ¶ 37 (even if the agency erroneously rejected the protester’s
bid on one ground, GAO found protester could not have been prejudiced because its bid
should have been rejected on another basis). Even if Horton had been notified of the defect
shortly after bid opening, Horton could not have cured that defect after bid opening. Spotless
Janitorial Services, Inc., B-257341, Sept. 15, 1994, 94-2 CPD ¶ 102; H.R. General
                                                -4-               Horton & Barber, CAB No. P-0792


Maintenance Corp., 44 D.C. Reg. at 8560. Horton was thus not prejudiced by the delayed
notification of the defective bid bond.

         Horton also argues that the District should be barred from awarding the contract to
Milani Construction because the District failed to act within 90 calendar days after bid
opening and presumably Milani’s bid expired. The record is not clear on whether the
contracting officer requested that the other bidders extend their bids in October 2008 beyond
the initial 90 days. Nevertheless, the contracting officer and Milani executed a contract on
March 5, 2009, and there is a notification on the same date to extend its bid. There is no
argument that Milani’s bid, at the time of bid opening, was nonresponsive or that the bid bond
was defective. The issue raised by Horton is whether Milani’s bid, if it expired after the
initial 90 day period, could be revived and an award made based on the revived bid. We
believe that Milani could have elected not to extend its bid but the record shows that it elected
to extend its bid and there was no legal error on the part of the contracting officer in entering
into a contract with Milani under its revived bid. See General Oil Corp., CAB No. P-0355,
Apr. 16, 1993, 40 D.C. Reg. 5097, 5102-03; Holk Development, Inc., B-230830.2, Dec. 1,
1988, 88-2 CPD ¶ 543.

        The contracting officer determined in a D&F dated October 24, 2008, and in a letter to
Horton dated October 24, 2008, that Horton’s bid was unreasonably low and that Horton was
therefore nonresponsible. The contracting officer asked Horton to confirm its bid price,
which Horton did, but the contracting officer did not ask Horton to further justify its bid
prices for the various line items. Horton maintains that it should have been given a further
opportunity to explain its pricing to the District, and that the “contracting officer acted in bad
faith by prematurely determining the protestor non-responsible without fully apprizing
himself of the Protester’s capabilities.”

        We see no evidence for concluding that the contracting officer acted in bad faith in
determining Horton’s bid price to be unreasonably low. Although the contracting officer
should have asked for additional information from Horton on the particular line items that he
found were unreasonably low, under the circumstances here we conclude that the
nonresponsibility determination is sustainable because Horton has not introduced sufficient
evidence rebutting the contracting officer’s findings on the pricing. Horton only presented
some evidence of salvage value per ton of steel but without identifying its total costs to
perform the solicited work, and evidence of its costs to perform the challenged line items,
there is no basis for us to conclude that the matter should be remanded to the contracting
office for further review. Horton should have introduced evidence of its costs and salvage
revenue in its original protest filing but failed to do so and even after the Agency Report
identified the various line items as being significantly below estimates and other bidders’
prices, Horton still failed to introduce adequate evidence of the reasonableness of its pricing.

                                        CONCLUSION

       For the reasons discussed above, we deny Horton’s protest.
