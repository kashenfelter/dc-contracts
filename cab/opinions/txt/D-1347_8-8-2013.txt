        This appeal arises from the Appellant’s request for an equitable adjustment under its
contract for tree trimming services with the District of Columbia. During the course of contract
performance, the District changed the way that it ordered tree trimming services from block-by-
block orders to tree-by-tree orders, which the Appellant contends was a constructive change to
the contract entitling it to an equitable adjustment in the contract price. For the reasons stated
herein, the Board holds that the Appellant is not entitled to an equitable adjustment for a
constructive change, and the appeal is denied.

                                            FINDINGS OF FACT

1.     The Appellant, C&D Tree Service, Inc. (“C&D”), and the District of Columbia
Department of Public Works entered into Contract No. 02-0014-AA-2-0-KA on May 15, 2002.
(Appeal File (“AF”) Ex. A.) The contract was for tree trimming services at various sites
throughout the District of Columbia. (AF Ex. A ¶ B).

2.      The original solicitation sought up to four separate contracts to trim trees of all sizes in
four award groups: District Wards 1 and 2 constituted the first award group; Wards 3 and 4, the
second; Wards 5 and 6, the third; and Wards 7 and 8, the fourth. (Id. ¶ I.9; Undisputed Material
Facts1 (“UMF”) ¶ 3.) Appellant’s bid prices were the lowest on all four award groups, resulting
in the award to Appellant of a single contract for all four segments. (UMF ¶ 4.)

3.      The contract was an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) contract for tree
trimming services, with fixed unit prices based on the size of the trees trimmed. (AF Ex. A ¶¶
B.1.1, F.1; UMF ¶ 2.) The contractor was required to furnish the specified trimming services to
the District, “when and if ordered,” and the District would order a minimum of $10,000.00 worth
of services.2 (AF Ex. A ¶ B.1.2.)


1
 See section D of the Joint Pretrial Statement, pages 5-7.
2
  Based on the solicitation’s expectation that multiple contracts would be awarded based on four Ward groups, the
Appellant interpreted the contract to require the District to order a minimum of $40,000.00 in tree trimming
services. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 167:7-14, 213:4-214:7, May 30, 2012.) In either case, the parties have stipulated that the
contract’s minimum order was $40,000.00. (See, e.g., Joint Pretrial Statement 1; UMF ¶ 14.)
                                                                                             C&D Tree Service, Inc.
                                                                                                 CAB No. D-1347

4.      The contract’s period of performance was one year from the date of award. (AF Ex. A ¶
F.2.1.) The contract also allowed the District to extend the term of this contract by exercising up
to four one-year option periods with the total contract duration not to exceed five years. (AF Ex.
A ¶ F.2.) Thus, the last option year terminated on May 15, 2007. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 97:17-19,
May 29, 2012.)

5.     The parties agree that the contract did not “dictate the manner in which the District was
required to assign tree trimming work to Appellant.” (UMF ¶ 6.) Under paragraph B.1.2 of the
contract, delivery or performance was to be made “only as authorized by orders issued in
accordance with the Ordering Clause.”3 (AF Ex. A ¶ B.1.2.)

6.     Further, as it relates to the Appellant’s contract performance, paragraph B.1.3 of the
contract states, “[t]here is no limit on the number of orders that may be issued. The District
Government may issue orders requiring tree trimming services to multiple destinations or
performance at multiple locations.” (AF Ex. A ¶ B.1.3.) Paragraph C.1.1 further states that the
“contractor shall furnish all labor, material, and equipment necessary to trim street line trees
located at various sites in the District. The location of the trees will be issued when the contract
is awarded.” (Id. ¶ C.1.1.)

7.      Addendum No. 3 to the solicitation, incorporated into the contract, consists of responses
to the questions raised by the bidders during the procurement process. (AF Ex. A, Addendum
#3.) In its responses to Questions Nos. 5 and 6, the District reserved the right to issue, on rare
occasion, emergency work orders that would require that tree trimming services be performed by
the contractor within 48 hours. (Id.) It also specified that the Appellant must provide at least two
tree trimming crews on a daily basis. (Id.)

        C&D’s Predecessor Contract Before November 2006

8.      The Appellant claims that, in compiling its bid for the disputed contract, it relied upon the
District’s prior ordering practices under C&D’s earlier tree trimming contracts, where the
District used a block-by-block ordering process. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 67:10-19.) In this regard, the
Appellant testified that it relied upon the historical labor, equipment, and overhead costs under
the District’s prior ordering method in calculating its cost per tree when it bid for the current
contract. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 67:15-19.)

9.     The Appellant contends that the District had ordered tree trimming services from the
Appellant on a block-by-block basis since at least 1989.4 (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 53:20-54:8, 67:13-
69:3.) To support this contention, the Appellant introduced its 19975 tree trimming contract with
the District (Contract No. OMS-5160-AA-DB, dated March 4, 1997).6 (See Appellant’s Hr’g
Ex. 1B.) Although, the 1997 contract was a requirements contract, rather than an IDIQ (id. at


3
  The Board finds, however, that although paragraph B.1.2 references an ordering clause, the contract does not
appear to contain a per se “Ordering Clause.”
4
  The Appellant had filled tree-trimming orders under the District’s predecessor contracts as both a prime contractor
and a subcontractor. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 53:20-54:3.)
5
  The 1997 contract was solicited on December 18, 1996, and is consequently referred to as the “1996 contract” in
the record. (See Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 1B at 1.)
6
  Only pages 1, 7, and 13 of the 1997 contract were admitted into evidence. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 192:7-8, 326:18-19)
                                                       -2-
                                                                                               C&D Tree Service, Inc.
                                                                                                   CAB No. D-1347

13), it included a clause identical to paragraph C.1.1 of the current contract (id. at 7).7 The
Appellant’s CEO, Scott F. Nelson, testified that prior to the disputed contract, the District had
never ordered the Appellant to trim trees on a tree-by-tree basis as its standard practice. (Hr’g
Tr. vol. 1, 69:9-71:10.) He also testified that individual tree ordering was “very rare” prior to
November 2006. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 69:18-72:16.)

10.     Under the 1997 contract, the District’s standard way of issuing work orders was the
“block-by-block” method, under which it assigned tree trimming work by identifying city blocks
where multiple trees required trimming. (UMF ¶ 7.) The Appellant’s CEO testified that after a
District employee identified streets that required tree trimming, the District would then issue
work orders to C&D to trim all the trees on a designated block. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 58:6-59:4.)
Nelson also testified that C&D’s own arborists would sometimes “identify subject streets that
were in need of tree care.” (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 58:6-9.)

11.     The Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (“COTR”) for the disputed contract,
John P. Thomas, testified that under the block-by-block ordering method District employees
would “comb the city” to identify trees that needed trimming. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 576:4-578:18,
May 31, 2012.) When the District’s field inspectors identified trees that required trimming, they
took the information down on hand-written lists, which would later be transferred to Excel
spreadsheets back at their offices. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 582:14-20.) The District would identify trees
according to its old MISTRE electronic inventory system, which assigned a unique 16-digit
identifier to each tree, helping to identify its location within the District. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 60:11-
61:10; Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 578:19-579:19.)

12.     After the District determined which block(s) contained trees that required trimming, the
Appellant would post “no parking” signs on the block designated for tree trimming work
approximately 72 hours prior to working on that block. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 58:12-16.) Using teams
that consisted of a six person crew, two aerial lifts, and a chipper truck, the Appellant would
perform tree trimming work up one side of the designated block and then back down the other
side of the same block. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 58:16-59:4.)

         The District’s Work Ordering Method After November 2006

13.    During the last option year of the contract which is the subject of this appeal, around
November of 2006, the District changed the way in which it ordered tree trimming work from
C&D.8 (UMF ¶ 7.) Instead of directing the Appellant to trim all (or most) trees on a city block,
the District started directing the Appellant to trim specific, individual trees throughout the city.
(UMF ¶ 7.)



7
  See supra Finding 6.
8
  Previously, around November 2005, the disputed contract ran out of funding and the District made the decision to
competitively solicit a new contract for these same tree trimming requirements that had been performed by the
Appellant. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 72:17-75:1.) The Appellant subsequently protested this solicitation and corrective
action was taken by the District to reinstate the second half of the 4th contract option year and the 5th option year of
the Appellant’s 2002 contract. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 75:3-9.) During the course of these events, the Appellant provided
no tree trimming services to the District until the District began ordering from the Appellant under the contract again
in November 2006. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 72:11-16.)
                                                         -3-
                                                                                           C&D Tree Service, Inc.
                                                                                               CAB No. D-1347

14.    This change in the way the District ordered tree trimming services from the Appellant
coincided with the city’s implementation of the “City Works” program. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 581:18-
582:10.) The COTR, however, testified that, while the City Works program was not fully
implemented until November 2006, this software had actually been procured by the District a
few years earlier. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 582:1-8.)

15.    The City Works program allowed the District to manage its workload and tree inventory
more efficiently by allowing the District to input various data into a searchable format and create
work orders from these data sets. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 77:2-8; Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 582:13-583:21.)
Because the City Works program was connected to the Mayor’s call center,9 citizen complaints
began to drive more of C&D’s assignments to prune certain trees in the District. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 3,
582:21-583:6, 588:20-589:4.) However, the COTR testified that, even after the City Works
implementation, the District did not solely rely on citizen complaints to determine which trees to
trim. Field inspectors from the District, who were now equipped with tablet computers running
City Works, continued to independently select trees for trimming services by the Appellant
including, for example, varying species of trees that were required to be trimmed at certain
seasonal timeframes across the city. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 585:7-588:18, 604:7-609:4; see also id. at
575:15-578:18.)

16.    The written record in this case also reflects that after the District began to order tree
trimming services on an individual tree basis under City Works, the District would still
periodically order tree trimming services for multiple trees on a city block. (See Dist. Hr’g Ex. 7
at 1762-67, 1776-78, 1783-84; see also Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 267:10-12, 282:3-20, May 30, 2012.)

17.       The Appellant testified that the cost of performance when orders were made on a tree-
by-tree basis was significantly greater than it had been under the block-by-block ordering
system. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 66:8-16.) According to the Appellant, productivity decreased because
workers had to move far more often, and the condition of trees assigned to the Appellant for
individual trimming were “the worst of the worst.” (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 66:21-67:9, 116:2-117:1,
136:15-20.) The Appellant claims that it suffered increased labor and fuel costs, higher dumping
fees, and increased costs of performance due to the poor condition of the assigned trees. (Hr’g
Tr. vol. 1, 113:16-117:4.)

18.     Both Nelson and the COTR testified, however, that while the District would periodically
prioritize certain tree assignments as requiring the most immediate attention, the Appellant
largely had discretion to prioritize the manner and order in which it completed its tree trimming
tasks. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 293:4-17; Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 592:4-20.) This, in turn, allowed the Appellant
to coordinate trimming any number of trees within the same part of the city to improve its
efficiency. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 293:22-294:3.)

19.      The parties do not dispute that in the course of the contract the District issued orders for
at least $40,000.00 worth of tree trimming work from Appellant, and thus ordered the minimum
quantity expressly required under the contract. (UMF ¶ 14; Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 214:1-9.)



9
  The Mayor’s call center allows District residents to directly contact the city government to request that varying
services be performed by District agencies. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 582:21-583:3, 601:18-602:3.)

                                                                                                 CAB No. D-1347

        Contract Extension and Proposed Price Adjustment

20.      On May 7, 2007, the Contracting Officer’s assistant, Kathy Hatcher, emailed the
Appellant to schedule a meeting to discuss a possible 6 month extension to the contract, as well
as issues related to a separate tree removal contract that was also being performed by the
Appellant. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 1 at 19.) The disputed contract was set to expire in May 2007
at the time the parties were arranging to conduct this meeting. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 227:11-228:18.)

21.     On or about May 11, 2007, the Appellant met with District contracting officials,
including Contracting Officer (“CO”) Jerry Carter, COTR Thomas, and Hatcher. (Hr’g Tr. vol.
1, 93:18-19; Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 547:2-6, 592:21–593:6; UMF ¶ 8.) At the meeting, in addition to
discussing its separate tree removal contract, the Appellant’s CEO hand-delivered a letter to the
CO dated May 9, 2007, which claimed that the Appellant had suffered damages associated with
the District’s shift from block-by-block orders to tree-by-tree orders under its tree trimming
contract. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 1 at 23-25; Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 93:12-19.) The letter stated that
more work was required to trim trees under the individual tree ordering approach due to the poor
condition of the trees selected for individual trimming and complained of the decrease in the
amount of the trees trimmed. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 1 at 25.) The letter therefore requested a
return to the block-by-block approach by the District or an equitable price adjustment under the
contract. (Id.)

22.    At the meeting the CO agreed to extend the disputed contract by a period of 6 months
beyond its original expiration date of May 2007. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 98:1-9.) The CO also agreed
to consider an adjustment to the pricing under the contract. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 434:13-435:13;
552:8-15.) The CO and the COTR, however, testified that the District did not agree at the May
11, 2007, meeting that the District would definitively alter the contract pricing for the 6 month
extension period or grant an equitable adjustment to the contract. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 437:2-14,
594:2-22.) Following this meeting, the CO directed the COTR to undertake the necessary
administrative work to prepare for the funding of the Appellant’s contract for an additional 6
month period. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 595:4-17.)

23.    Following the foregoing meeting,10 the CO issued a unilateral modification to the
contract that extended the term by six months, through November 14, 2007, expressly at no
additional cost.11 (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 1 at 27.) Hatcher admitted that she independently
assumed that the District would negotiate new prices with the Appellant in connection with the 6
month extension period and informed the Appellant that the District would issue a bilateral
modification in the future reflecting negotiated pricing for this extension period.12 (See id. at 26;
Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 552:19-22.) No evidence was presented at the hearing which established that the


10
   While the modification itself is dated May 10, 2007, it was forwarded to C&D on May 11, 2007. (See Appellant’s
Hr’g Ex. 1 at 26.)
11
    Although the modification extending the contract term was unilaterally executed by the District, the Appellant
still signed and returned the modification document to the District on May 14, 2007. (Id. at 28; Hr’g Tr. vol. 1,
99:19-100:2.)
12
   CO Carter testified that he had not seen Hatcher’s email prior to testifying. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 427:16-428:7.) His
testimony further reveals that Hatcher took the lead in administering the contract and could subsequently make
recommendations to him on contract pricing matters. (See, e.g., Hr’g Tr. vol. 3, 439:4-21; 447:19-449:9; 488:2-
489:4.)
                                                       -5-
                                                                                              C&D Tree Service, Inc.
                                                                                                  CAB No. D-1347

CO directed Hatcher to engage in these price discussions, or knew that these discussions were
taking place.

24.      Following the District’s issuance of the 6 month contract extension, on September 4,
2007, the Appellant submitted new proposed unit prices to Hatcher to be applied in this
extension period.13 (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 1 at 31-32.) The Appellant’s new proposed unit
pricing for the extension period included an additional $150.00 fee per tree. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1,
105:14-17.) The District, however, never formally responded to, or accepted, this proposed
pricing. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 118:12-15.) On December 27, 2007, the Appellant sent an additional
letter to CO Carter requesting a response to its proposed price adjustment to the contract during
the extension period to which the CO never replied.14 (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 1 at 35-36; Hr’g Tr.
vol. 1, 120:3-19.)

         The Appellant’s Request for Equitable Adjustment

25.    The Appellant subsequently submitted a Request for Equitable Adjustment (“REA”) to
CO Carter in the amount $613,500.00 as damages for an alleged constructive change resulting
from the District’s shift from ordering tree trimming service on a block-by-block basis to an
individual tree-by-tree system on April 29, 2008. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 1 at 6–14; UMF ¶ 11.)

26.    In calculating its damages in the REA, the Appellant began by determining the monthly
average revenue generated under the previous block-by-block ordering method. (Appellant’s
Hr’g Ex. 1 at 10.) After making various adjustments in this calculation,15 the Appellant
determined that there was a “net underage of payment” in the amount of $444,538.33 for the
extension period.16 (Id.) The Appellant then added a 30% mark-up for costs unrelated to the
change to individual tree ordering, which included increased fuel and labor costs and increased
dump fees. (Id.; Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 133:16-134:15.) The Appellant then added another 10% mark-
up to reflect the poor condition of the trees. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 1 at 10.) Altogether, the
Appellant determined that it was entitled to an additional $635,688.82 in additional
compensation. (Id.) The Appellant, however, only requested an equitable adjustment in the
amount of $613,500.00 consistent with the $150.00 per tree price increase in its September 4,
2007, request to the District for an increase in unit pricing under the contract. (Id.; Hr’g Tr. vol.
1, 137:8-138:21.)

27.    CO Carter denied the Appellant’s REA in a May 8, 2008, Contracting Officer’s Final
Decision. (AF Ex. D.1; UMF ¶ 12.) The CO determined that no constructive change had
occurred because the contract specifications did not dictate the manner in which the District
13
   The Appellant testified at the hearing that it was its understanding that the District was planning to renegotiate
unit prices with the Appellant for this extension period. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 98:1-9.)
14
   The District did not respond to this and subsequent inquiries regarding the price adjustment requested by the
Appellant. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 120:20-123:22.)
15
   The Appellant made adjustments to reflect the increased size of the trees and a 30 percent decrease in costs related
to a change in C&D’s operations. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 129:3-132:15.)

   In calculating the REA, the Appellant used 10 months as the extension period. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 2, 245:12-17;
Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 1 at 10.) In its complaint, the Appellant states that the amount claimed in the REA is based on
work that was performed “during the six-month extension period.” (Compl. ¶ 22.) Similarly, the parties stipulated
that the period in dispute is “the six-month extension period.” (UMF ¶ 9.) (Appellant’s Post Hr’g Br. 27.)
Addressing this discrepancy, Nelson testified that he used 10 months because the District continued to order work
under the contract though no formal extension was issued. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 1, 127:4-11.)

would order tree trimming work to be performed on either an individual tree basis or a block-by-
block basis. (AF Ex. D.1 at 4.) The CO further determined that the Appellant had failed to
adequately support its claim with cost and price data. (Id. at 4-5.)

28.    The Appellant filed its Notice of Appeal with the Board on July 16, 2008, which
appealed the CO’s May 8, 2008, final decision denying its REA. The Board conducted a four-
day hearing on the merits in this matter from May 29, 2012 through May 31, 2012, and on June
22, 2012.

        Contentions of the Parties

29.     The Appellant claims entitlement to an equitable adjustment because the District
allegedly constructively changed the contract when it shifted from ordering on a block-by-block
basis to a tree-by-tree basis based upon the manner in which the District historically ordered tree
trimming services from the Appellant. (Appellant’s Post Hr’g Br. 15-18.)

30.     The Appellant, therefore, asserts that it is entitled to recover an equitable adjustment in
the amount of $613,500.00 because of the District’s alleged constructive change to the contract
when it switched from ordering tree trimming services on a block-by-block basis to a tree-by-tree
basis. (Appellant’s Post Hr’g Br. 21-23.) Alternatively, the Appellant claims $387,548.00 based
on the report of its expert, Ernest Agresto.17 (Id. at 23-26.) In arriving at his damages figure,
Agresto first determined the Appellant’s lost revenue during the extension period by essentially
comparing the monthly average revenue before the change in ordering methodology and then
separately during the extension period.18 (Hr’g Tr. vol. 4, 664:19-668:18, June 22, 2013;
Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 3 at 9.) Agresto’s analysis also incorporated an assessment of additional
labor and other fixed costs allocable to the contract based upon revenue amounts in ultimately
determining that the Appellant was owed an additional $352,316.00. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 3 at
6-11; Hr’g Tr. vol. 4, 667:3-687:13.) Lastly, Agresto added a 10% mark-up for profit to arrive at
the $387,548.00 figure. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 3 at 6.)

31.    The District denies the Appellant’s right to any additional compensation under the
contract. The District maintains that its obligation under this IDIQ contract, which it satisfied,
was to order the contract minimum of $40,000.00 in services from the Appellant. (Dist. Post
Hr’g Br. 17-18.)

32.     Further, the District also argues that its shift in the manner in which it ordered tree
trimming services—from block-by-block to tree-by-tree—did not constitute a constructive
change to the contract because the contract is silent as to the manner in which the District would
order tree trimming services. (Id. at 19-20.) The District further contends that the contract itself
prohibits constructive changes because changes were required to be in writing and signed by the



17
   Agresto testified that his calculations were limited to considering C&D’s accounting data and that he did not
consider technical issues that would be outside his accounting expertise. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 4, 652:4-16, June 22, 2013.)
Agresto also testified that this limitation on accounting data led to differences from the REA’s damages calculation
because Nelson was able to use his technical expertise and rely on more contract specific data. (Hr’g Tr. vol. 4,
696:19-698:17.)
18
   Agresto also used a 10 month extension period in his calculations. (Appellant’s Hr’g Ex. 3 at 9.)

its claimed damages.19 (Dist. Post Hr’g Br. 22-24, 28-30.)

                                                 DISCUSSION

       We exercise jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to D.C. Code § 2-360.03(a)(2)
(2011).20

        The central issue in this case is whether the District constructively changed the contract
when it began ordering tree trimming on a tree-by-tree basis thereby entitling the Appellant to an
equitable adjustment under the contract. Equitable adjustments are corrective measures to make
a contractor whole when the government modifies a contract. Int’l Data Prods. Corp. v. United
States, 492 F.3d 1317, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing Ets-Hokin Corp. v. United States, 420 F.2d
716, 720 (Ct. Cl. 1970)). An equitable adjustment is due under both formal changes and
constructive changes. District of Columbia v. Org. for Envtl. Growth, Inc., 700 A.2d 185, 203
(D.C. 1997), on remand, CAB No. D-850, 49 D.C. Reg. 3353 (Apr. 13, 2001), rev’d on other
grounds sub nom. Abadie v. Org. for Envtl. Growth, Inc., 806 A.2d 1225 (D.C. 2002); see also
Aydin Corp. v. Widnall, 61 F.3d 1571, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (“Where [the Government] requires
a constructive change in a contract, the Government must fairly compensate the contractor for
the costs of the change.”).

        “A constructive change occurs where a contractor performs work beyond the contract
requirements without a formal order, either by an informal change order or due to the fault of the
government.” Weigel Hochdrucktechnik GmbH & Co. KG, ASBCA No. 57207, 12-1 BCA ¶

05-1 BCA ¶ 32,806 at *23 (Nov. 19, 2004); see also Org. for Envtl. Growth, 700 A.2d at 203
(defining constructive changes as those “informally ordered by the government or required by
government fault despite the absence of a formal change order.”).

        To prove entitlement under a constructive change theory, a contractor must show a bona
fide “change” and the issuance of an “order” under the relevant contract. Org. for Envtl. Growth,
700 A.2d at 203. To meet the “change” component, the contractor must have performed work in
addition to, or different from, that required under the contract. Id.; LB&B Assocs., Inc. v. United
States, 91 Fed. Cl. 142, 154 (2010).

       Additionally, to establish the “order” component under a constructive change theory, the
added work must not have been volunteered by the contractor, but rather directed by a
government official with the requisite authority. See LB&B Assocs., 91 Fed. Cl. at 154;
Northrop Grumman Sys. Corp. Space Sys. Div., ASBCA No. 54774, 10-2 BCA ¶ 34,517 at *73
(July 22, 2010); Intercontinental Mfg. Co., ASBCA No. 48506, 03-1 BCA ¶ 32,131 at *50 (Jan.
3, 2003). The contractor must also demonstrate that the constructive change increased its costs

   Along these lines, the District also faults the Appellant’s damage calculations for using a 10 month period instead
of the stipulated 6 months. (Dist. Post Hr’g Br. 26-27.)

A.       Appellant Has Failed to Establish a Prior Course of Dealing that Required the District
         to Order Tree Trimming Services on a Block-by-Block Basis Under the Disputed
         Contract.

        The parties agree that the contract was silent as to any particular methodology that would
be used by the District to order services under the contract. (Finding 5.) Nevertheless, the
Appellant argues that its prior course of dealing with the District—under its earlier 1997 tree
trimming contract—established that the District would continue to order tree trimming on a
block-by-block basis under the instant (2002) contract. (Appellant’s Post Hr’g Br. 17-19.) As
such, the Appellant essentially argues that the District’s block-by-block ordering methodology
under its prior contract(s) effectively became a term of the present contract. (Id. at 17-18.)
Accordingly, the Appellant contends that the District constructively changed the instant contract
when it switched from ordering tree trimming services from the Appellant on a block-by-block
basis to a tree-by-tree basis. (Id. at 16.)

        A prior course of dealing is defined as “a sequence of previous conduct between the
parties to an agreement which is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of
understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.”21 DeLeon Indus., LLC v.
Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, CBCA No. 986, 12-1 BCA ¶ 34,904 at *11 (July 12, 2011) (citations
omitted); C.R. Pittman Constr. Co., ASBCA No. 54901, 08-1 BCA ¶ 33,777 at *11 (Jan. 22,
2008) (quoting RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 223(1) (1981)). A prior course of
dealing may “establish the intent of the parties with respect to the proper interpretation of
contract language.” Prods. Eng’g Corp. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., GSBCA Nos. 12503, 13051, 98-
2 BCA ¶ 29,851 (June 30, 1988). However, to establish an enforceable term of a contract, the
conduct establishing the course of dealings must reflect the joint or common understanding of
the parties. Sperry Flight Sys. v. United States, 548 F.2d 915, 922 (Ct. Cl. 1977). If the prior
course of dealing cannot “reasonably be construed as indicative of the parties’ intentions,” then
that course of dealings will not establish an enforceable contract term. Id. Accordingly, the
proponent of a prior course of dealing argument must demonstrate “actual knowledge by both
parties of the prior course of dealings and its significance to the contract.” Anchor/Darling
Valve Co., ASBCA No. 46109, 95-1 BCA ¶ 27,595 at *5 (Mar. 20, 1995) (emphasis added);
Yamin, ASBCA No. 35373, 90-2 BCA ¶ 22,657 at *10 (Jan. 31, 1990).

       Thus, under this foregoing jurisprudence, federal courts and boards of contract appeals
have extensively considered the evidence which is required to establish that there was a prior

21
   The Board has addressed a prior course of dealing legal theory only once before in Jet Blast, Inc., CAB No. D-
1039, 52 D.C. Reg. 4217 (Aug. 3, 2004). However, in that case, we summarily rejected the appellant’s argument,
holding that a prior course of dealing consistent with the express terms of the contract could not modify the contract.
Id. at 4222. Because the Board has not extensively dealt with this legal theory in prior decisions, we look to the
jurisprudence of the federal courts and boards of contract appeals for guidance, as we have traditionally done. See,
e.g., Keystone Plus Constr. Corp., CAB No. D-1358, 2012 WL 554443 at *7-*8 (Jan. 27, 2012) (citing multiple
federal cases); K.B. Hom & Assocs., CAB No. P-154, 38 D.C. Reg. 3237, 3239 (Mar. 5, 1991) (stating that the
Board looks to federal case law for guidance); see also Abadie v. D.C. Contract Appeals Bd., 916 A.2d 913, 919
(D.C. 2007) (“Because District contracting practice parallels federal government contract law, we also look to the
relevant decisions of federal tribunals with particular expertise in this area.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

course of dealing between contractual parties which altered or defined the contract terms. For
instance, in Products Engineering Corp., the contractor argued that the government’s previous
approval of its quality control system and methods of testing for compliance with specifications
barred the government’s use of a different method during the contract. GSBCA Nos. 12,503,
13,051, 98-2 BCA ¶ 29,851. In this regard, much like the Appellant in the present case, the
contractor argued that there was an established prior course of dealing under previous contracts
with the government, lasting several years, whereby the government had repeatedly accepted the
contractor’s same equipment and quality control procedures. Id. For these reasons, the
contractor argued that the government was later precluded from imposing its own independent
quality control measures which found the contractor’s parts to be nonconforming. Id.
Ultimately, the General Services Board of Contract Appeals found that the circumstances did not
warrant extending the prior course of dealing doctrine to bar the government from using different
test instruments from those used by the contractor without notification so long as the
government’s standards were not contrary to the contract provisions. Id. Moreover, in
effectively underscoring the requirement that both parties have knowledge of the significance of
a prior course of dealing, the board found that there was insignificant evidence in that case to
establish that the government knowingly accepted nonconforming equipment or indicated its
willingness to waive the equipment specification requirements. Id.

       Similarly, in DCX-CHOL Enterprises, the Armed Service Board of Contract Appeals
considered a contractor’s claim that it had a prior course of dealing with the government
whereby the contractor was permitted to supply its shipments without the complete traceability
documentation required under the contract. ASBCA No. 54,707, 08-2 BCA ¶ 33,889 at *11
(June 18, 2008). However, the board rejected this argument finding that the missing element in
the contractor’s claim of prior course of dealing was “mutuality” which requires evidence of
“actual knowledge by both parties of the prior course of dealing and its significance to the
contract.” Id.

        Additionally, in Sperry Flight Systems, the United States Court of Federal Claims dealt
with a situation somewhat analogous to the present case where the contractor argued that, by
virtue of its prior course of dealing with the agency where its higher catalogue prices had been
accepted by the government without requiring cost and pricing data, a practice was established
between the parties that the government would continue to accept these same catalogue prices in
the future. 548 F.2d 915, 922-23 (Ct. Cl. 1977). Specifically, in that case, while the government
had previously paid the contractor for certain parts based upon its catalogue prices and without
requiring cost and pricing data, it was later required to submit cost and pricing data to the
contracting officer to substantiate its catalogue prices before they would be accepted by the
government. Id. at 917. Ultimately, the government determined that the contractor’s catalog
prices for the parts at issue were not substantiated and reduced the amount that it would agree to
pay for them below the contractor’s catalogue prices. Id. at 917-18. In ultimately rejecting the
contractor’s argument of a prior course of dealing with the government in accepting its higher
catalogue prices, the court stated that the factual record did not “even allow an inference that the
Government, by having accepted plaintiff's catalog prices on past occasions, thereby intended to
commit itself to continue such a practice into the future.” Id. at 923. Rather, the contractor’s
argument amounted to “only a statement of its own unilateral assumptions concerning the Navy's
expected future conduct” in accepting a higher priced product. Id.

                                                                                   CAB No. D-1347

        In the instant case, the Appellant alleges that a prior course of dealing was established
between the parties by virtue of the fact that, under earlier contracts between these same parties,
the District always ordered block-by-block tree trimming services from the Appellant and thus
was essentially required to continue to do so under the disputed contract. Only one prior 1997
tree trimming contract between the parties was introduced by the Appellant at trial but,
nonetheless, the Appellant seemingly argues that this one contract established an understanding
between the parties that future tree trimming contracts would implicitly include a requirement
that the District order tree trimming services from the Appellant on a block-by-block basis.

        The facts elicited at trial, however, evidence that the District’s methodology for ordering
tree trimming service from the Appellant under the 1997 contract, as well as the disputed 2002
contract, was primarily based upon the internal ordering technology that was available to the
District. Initially, under the 1997 contract relied upon by the Appellant, the District’s somewhat
basic mechanism for identifying trees in need of service was to simply have its inspectors drive
around the city and visually inspect blocks where multiple trees were in need of service, take
hand written notes on the trees needing service, and then enter those notes into an Excel
spreadsheet. (Finding 11). The District would identify trees in need of service according to its
prior MISTRE electronic inventory system, which assigned a unique 16-digit identifier to each
tree, helping to identify its location within the District. (Id.) In turn, the District would notify
the Appellant of trees in need of service on specific city blocks leading to block-by-block tree
trimming orders being issued by the District. (Finding 10.)

         However, there was no evidence introduced at the hearing which showed that the parties
both mutually acknowledged, or understood, that the District intended to always order tree
trimming service on a block-by-block basis in this manner. In fact, the evidence seems to
suggest, to the contrary, that the District had intended for some time to improve the efficiency of
its tree ordering process by virtue of the fact that it had procured the City Works software a few
years in advance of its actual implementation in Year 2006. (See Finding 14.)

         Moreover, while the Appellant argues that the change in the ordering methodology was,
in fact, a “change” admitted by the District to have occurred, the facts establish that this change
was essentially a byproduct of the City Works software implementation by the District that
allowed the city to overall more efficiently manage its workload and tree inventory. (Findings
14-15.) There is simply no evidence that the District understood, or even implicitly agreed, that
it would not seek to improve upon the efficiency of its tree inventory management process by
making no alterations in its ordering methodology with the Appellant for tree trimming services
after the 1997 contract was performed. The fact that block-by-block ordering may have allowed
the Appellant to presumably perform its services in a more efficient manner did not commit the
District to always utilize this ordering process on future contracts.

        Thus, the Board finds that the facts underlying this case do not show that there was
“mutuality” between the parties to agree to bind themselves to a block-by-block ordering
requirement over the entire term of the disputed contract based upon a prior course of dealing
under an earlier contract. In short, similar to facts in Sperry Flight Systems, supra, the
Appellant’s reliance on a prior course of dealing theory in the instant case is based upon its
“unilateral assumption” that the District would continue to order services using a block-by-block
ordering process as it had before. Accordingly, the Appellant has also failed to establish that the
District’s shift in ordering methodology constructively changed the contract’s terms.

B.       The District Met Its Ordering Obligations Under the Contract.

        Having found that the Appellant is not entitled to damages arising from an alleged
constructive change to the contract ordering process as discussed above, the Board must also
consider whether the District otherwise met, or altered, its overall ordering requirements under
the disputed contract, as this issue was raised by the District. In this regard, the parties agree that
the contract was an IDIQ contract with a minimum purchase obligation of either $10,000.00 (the
plain language of the contract) or $40,000.00 (the parties’ stipulation). (Finding 3.) The parties
also agree that the District ordered at least $40,000.00 in services under the contract. (Finding
19.)

       An IDIQ contract only requires that the government order a stated minimum quantity of
supplies or services. Travel Ctr. v. Barram, 236 F.3d 1316, 1319 (Fed Cir. 2001); see also
DynCorp, ASBCA No. 38862, 91-2 BCA ¶ 24,044 at *4 (May 1, 1991) (“Under an indefinite
quantity contract, the Government is only obligated to order the minimum quantity stated.”).
Once the government purchases the minimum stated in the contract its purchasing obligation
under the contract is satisfied. Travel Ctr., 236 F.3d at 1319.

        The Appellant’s measure of its alleged monetary damages in this case appears to be based
upon its contention that it received less revenue after the District switched to individual tree
ordering. For example, the Appellant argues that the switch to individual tree ordering “resulted
in a severe 87% decrease in the amount of tree locations serviced by C&D.” (Appellant’s Post
Hr’g Br. 18-19.) Similarly, both the Appellant’s REA and the Appellant’s expert report begin
their damage calculations by determining the Appellant’s lost revenue during the extension
period. (Findings 26, 30.)

        Appellant’s lost revenue claim, however, is without basis as the District was not
obligated to procure services from the Appellant “beyond the minimum contract price.” See
Travel Ctr., 236 F.3d at 1319. Indeed, even if the Appellant anticipated that ultimately the
District would order a greater amount of work under the contract, that did not alter the fact that
the District was only obligated to purchase the specified contract dollar minimum. Varilease
Tech. Grp., Inc. v. United States, 289 F.3d 795, 799 (Fed. Cir. 2003). As stated above, it is not
disputed that the District ordered more than the required minimum $40,000.00 in tree trimming
services under the contract. (Finding 19.) Because the District satisfied its purchasing
obligations under the contract, the Appellant is not entitled to any relief from the Board beyond
the requirements previously ordered and paid for by the District.22 See Travel Ctr., 236 F.3d at
1319.

                                                 CONCLUSION


22
   By way of analogy, the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals addressed a similar constructive change
argument under a requirements contract for mowing services. See Maggie’s Landscaping, Inc., ASBCA Nos.
52462, 52463, 04-2 BCA ¶ 32,647 (June 2, 2004). In Maggie’s Landscaping, the government ordered less mowing
than its monthly estimates due to dry and wet conditions that affected the growth and health of the grass. Id. at *5-6.
The board held that even if the variance in ordering from the estimated amounts was significant, such variance did
not constitute a constructive change because “a change in operations by a contracting entity made independent of the
contract that results in a reduction in requirements will not constitute a breach or a constructive change.” Id. at *16.

        Based upon the matters discussed herein, the Board finds that Appellant has not
established that the District constructively changed the disputed contract by modifying its
ordering methodology for tree trimming services and, therefore, Appellant is not entitled to an
equitable adjustment to the contract. Further, the Board finds that the District met the minimum
ordering requirements under the contract as it relates to the service amounts which it procured
from the Appellant. The appeal is denied.

SO ORDERED.
