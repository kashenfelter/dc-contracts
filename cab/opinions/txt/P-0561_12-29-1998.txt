                                               OPINION ;,

        Two prospective contractors, Ideal Electronic Security Company and AccuTech Systems, Inc.,'
protested the decision ofthe Distdct of Columbia Public School,s ("DCPS").to award Simplex Time
Recorder Company ("Simplex") a contract under Solicitation No. DCPS-R-98036-0S for a closed circuit
television surveillance system at various public schools. The protesters contend that DCPS improperly
evaluated the proposals and improperly determined Simplex to be the only offeror within the competitiv~
range.

        We conclude that DCPS violated no law or regulation in its evaluation ofthe proposals and that
the record does not show that the technical evaluation ofthe proposals was either irrational or arbitrary.
The evaluation and scoring ultimately adopted by the contraCting officer was consistent with the evaluation
scheme established in the solicitation. Accordingly, we deny the consolidated protests.

                                           BACKGROUND

        On June 5, 1998, DCPS issued Solicitation No. DCPS-R-98036-0S for a closed circuit television
surveillance system at various public school locations. (Agency Report ("AR") Ex. 1). Section M.3 ofthe
solicitation defined the selection criteria and corresponding values as follows:                      '

        Five prospective contractors submitted responsive proposals by the solicitation's closing date and
time on July 20, 1998. Proposals
                           ,        were submitted
                                              ,      by Ideal, AccuTech, Simplex, Cardkey Systems, Inc.,
and Condortech Services, Inc. (AR at 3). On July 22, 1998, a technical evaluation panel ("TEP")
appointed by the contracting officer reviewed the five proposals. According to instructions from the
contracting officer, the evaluators first independently evaluated and scored each proposal. (AR Ex. 7).
Based on all technical and price criteria, and including the 18 LSDBE points for which Ideal qualified, and
correcting various arithmetic errors by two ofthe evaluators;  "
                                                                 the five proposals had the following,

       Next, the TEP met "to discuss the strengths and w~aknesses ofeach proposal with the objective
ofreaching a consensus on its merits and deficiencies, relative to the evaluation,criteria/factors." (AR Ex.
7). The TEP members met and discusse<,t the offerors and their proposals, including strengths and

cameras and video multiplexors and performance problems on one prior contract. (AR Supp. Ex. 18).2
In the course ofthis consensus evaluation meeting, the TEP members then resqored the proposals based
on their discussions. The panel members state that their detailed collective technical discussion and
reassessment highlighted technical deficiencies in some of~e proposals, including Ideal's, that were not
noted by various members during their individual assessments. Ideal's consensus technical score was 37
points lower than its average technical score from the TEP individual evaluations, decreasing from 110.24
to 73. The decrease was primarily under the criteria for operational capacity and technical approach which
decreased by a total of34 points between them. Simplex's consensus technical ~core was about 5 points
higher than its average technical score from the individual evaluati<?ns by the TEP members. The following
summarizes the results of the consensus scoring:

(AREx. 9; AREx. 13, at 5; ARat 5). The TEP recommended that the competitive range be limited to
Si!nplex, because the other offerors had no reasonable chance ofsupplanting Simplex as the highest ranked
offeror in terms oftechnical and price. On July 22, 1998, *e contracting officer met with the TEP and
discussed their consensus evaluations, scoring, and recommendations. The contracting officer agreed with·
the TEP because the next closest two offerors, though close in technical scoring, were far lower in the price
scoring because they offered prices 200 and 300 percent higher than that offered by Simplex. Ideal and
AccuTech were considered to he too weak under the technical criteria. (AR Ex. 11; AR Supp. Ex. 18).

         On July 24 and July 29, 1998, the contracting officer conducted negotiations with Simplex,
requestedaBAFO,andreceivedSimplex'BAFOonJuly3), 1'998. Thecontractingofficerdetermined
that the BAFO price offered by Simplex was fair and reasonable and thereafter awarded a contract on
August 5, 1998.

         Ideal filed its protestonAugust21, 1998, docketed as CAB No. P-554. It is not clear from the
record whether Ideal ever sought and received adebriefing. On September 28, 1998, DCPS' contracting
officer forwarded to us a protest ofAccuTech which had been misfiled with DCPS. AccuTech' s protest
was docketed as CAB No. P-561.

         In determining the propriety of an evaluation and selection decision, we examine the record to,
determine whether the decision was reasonable and in accord ,with the evaluation criteria listed in the
solicitation and whether there were any violations ofprocurement laws or regulations. Health Right, Inc.,
CAB No. P-507, Oct. 15, 1997,9 P.D. 7372,7395. Implicit in the foregoing is that the evaluation and
selection decision must be documented in sufficient detail to s~owthat it is not arbitrary. Id; Southwest
Marine, 96-1 CPD ~ 56; S&M Property Management, B-243051, June 28, 1991,91-1 CPD ~ 615.
In particular, the agency's technical evaluation documentation is required to include an analysis ofthe ,
technically acceptable and unacceptable proposals, including an assessment of each offeror's ability to '
accomplish the technical r.equirements.
                                                                                                       .
         Ideal argues the contracting officer improperly relied on fl:1e subjective opinion ofone TEP niember
concerning Ideal' s past performance on another contract, injustifyhlg· the significant decrease in its technical
scores (from the individual assessments to the consensus assessment) and its elimination from the
competitive range. That argument does not take account of the additional supplementation offered by the
District, including the affidavits ofthree ofthe TEP members and the contracting officer. Ideal argues that
we should disregard those materials because they were submitted well after the Agency Report and after
Ideal had responded to the Agency Report. Although we agree with Ideal that the record, as it existed
prior to the Districf s last supplementatiotl, did not adeguately document the evaluation and selection
process, at least with regard to the consensus evaluation ofIdeal, we believe that the supplemental affidavits
provide adequate explanation for the recommendations ofthe TEP and the evaluation and selection
decision ofthe contracting officer. These affidavits shoul~have been prepared and submitted as part of
the Agency Report. Nevertheless, we will not exclude them from the record because it appears that no
debriefing occurred and no depositions were conducted ofthe relevant District personnel. Thus, the key
protest issues did not crystallize until after the Agency Report anti its exhibits were served on Ideal. When
Ideal pointed out in its comments on the Agency Report that the record lacked substantial information
supporting Ideal' s consensus evaluation and scoring, the District responded with the supplemental affidavits.

         In other circumstances, post-Agency Report amplifications might not carry significant weight. Here;
however, the facts set forth in the affidavits are consistent with the contracting officer's earlier and poorly
documented conclusions. The affidavits also explain the rather vague comment in the TEP final report that
the "detailed collective technical assessment highlighted technical deficiencies that were not noted in the
individual assessments" - a reference primarily to the significant difference betwe~n the consensus technical
scoring and the average of the individual technical assessments ~fIdeal, and the comment that "Ideal's past
performance rating was reduced based upon the technical expert member's knowledge of the company." .
More importantly, Ideal has not rebutted the statements containea in the affidavits which detail deficiencies
in the cameras and video multiplexors proposed by Ideal. Fo~ these reasons, we have permitted the
District to supplement the record and we fmd that the supplemenull affidavits provide an adequate rationale
for the recommendations ofthe TEP and ~e competitive range .and selection d¥terminations made by the
contracting officer.

        There is no indication in the record that either the TEP or the contracting officer considered criteria
other than those provided in the solicitation. Thus, the argument that DCPS did not evaluate according to

the specified criteria is without merit. AccuTech' s argument that its price was lower than that ofSimplex 's
and that AccuTech's technical offering met the specification requirements does not contradict the,

and technical criteria. Therefore, AccuTech's protest does ":ot'State a meritorious ground.

                                             CONCLUSION

        The consolidated protests are denied.
